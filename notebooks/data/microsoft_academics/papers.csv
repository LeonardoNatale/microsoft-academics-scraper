Systems either focus on carbon sequestration or combine sequestration with cash crop cultivation. The latter provide carbon payments with potential income from cash crop sales. Uncertainty about the future costs and benefits of maintaining and utilizing the land-use systems over time is addressed via application of Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that compared with sequestration-only systems those that combine sequestration and cash crop production have higher net benefits, although they have less carbon-sequestration potential. Homestead planting provides the most attractive balance among competing policy goals. Carbon payments contribute to cash income and may enable smallholders to overcome initial project investment costs.","Trade offs,Payment,Land use,Economics,Cost–benefit analysis,Cash crop,Carbon sequestration,Carbon project,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Solidarity,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Public economics,Property rights,Program Design Language,Silver bullet,Natural resource economics,Livelihood,Solidarity,Socioeconomics,Political economy of climate change,Soil conservation,Soil carbon,Silvopasture,Woodland,Vegetation,Species richness,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Revenue,Property rights,Sustainable development,Natural resource,Land tenure,Tax revenue,Revenue,Payment,Sustainability,Reforestation,Physics","Charles Palmer,Tilmann Silber,Nihar Ranjan Das,Stefano Pagiola,Agustin Arcenas,Gunars Platais,N.

1,"Old wine, new bottles? Investigating the differential adoption of ‘climate-smart’ agricultural practices in western Kenya",2017-01-01,Journal of Rural Studies,10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2017.09.010,"Abstract This study assesses factors influencing the adoption of land management practices associated with a World Bank-financed project on ‘climate-smart’ agriculture: the Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project. Drawing upon mixed-methods research with participating farmers in Bungoma County, western Kenya, we find modest reported adoption rates overall for project-encouraged practices, amounting to 53.6 percent on average. However, we also find that there are systematic differences in the reported adoption rates of individual practices. Disaggregating our sample into three classes or ‘wealth groups’, we find that the ‘very poor’ and ‘poor’ groups exhibit substantially lower adoption rates (42 percent and 49 percent, respectively) relative to the ‘less poor’ wealth group (73 percent). Across these groups, practices related to livestock management and pest management are systematically less adopted (0–45 percent) than more popular practices such as agroforestry and tillage management, the reported adoption of which both range from 60 to 80 percent. Consequently, we suggest that barriers to the adoption of apparently ‘climate smart’ agricultural practices at scale may increasingly be political-economic rather than simply technical-managerial in nature. This reflects the poorest strata of farmers' struggles to negotiate the increasingly externally imposed imperatives of climate adaptation and mitigation with the necessity of ‘simple reproduction’ or survival of the household as a socioeconomic unit. Future generations of ‘climate smart’ agricultural programmes may thus benefit from disaggregating adaptation and mitigation objectives in order to avoid unduly burdening the poorest strata of participating households in rural African contexts.","Socioeconomics,Socioeconomic status,Negotiation,Livestock management,Land management,Integrated pest management,Environmental resource management,Economics,Carbon project,Agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Sustainability,Soil indicators,Sociology,Sustainability,Rural development,Politics,Sustainability,Productive capacity,Ecosystem services,Sustainability,No-till farming,Intensive farming,Sustainability,Soil quality,Poverty,Social exclusion,Political ecology,Natural resource,Social group,Social class,Political economy,Subsidy,Panel data,Food security,Natural disaster,Livestock farming,Genetic resources","Connor Joseph Cavanagh,Anthony Kibet Chemarum,Paul Olav Vedeld,Jon Geir Petursson,Ken E.

2,"Implications on equity in agricultural carbon market projects: a gendered analysis of access, decision making, and outcomes",2015-01-01,Environment and Planning A,10.1177/0308518X15595897,"Carbon market projects have focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, often at the expense of achieving sustainable development goals. A central pillar in sustainable development is equity, yet most projects pay little attention to equity implications for underrepresented farmers, especially women. Agricultural carbon market projects that explicitly seek to promote sustainable agricultural land management practices are quickly gaining attention worldwide for their promise to deliver the â€˜triple-winâ€™: adaptation, food security, and mitigation. Previous experience with other payment for ecosystem services projects indicate that women often are marginalized and their needs ignored. To address this gap, this case study examined the Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project with a focus on gender equity in access, decision making, and outcomes. Results show that women had less access to joining the project than men, because they did not have the same level of influence in decision making at a household level. At the project level, both men and women had little influence in establishing project requirements and potential benefits, as these were decided upon prior to farmer recruitment. Regarding outcomes, women tended to participate in more project activities, and would in return reap more nonmonetary benefits than men. However, the costs involved in achieving these benefits was nontrivial: women's farm labor time increased significantly due to the substantial time and effort required to implement sustainable agricultural land management practices. If agricultural soil carbon market projects are to achieve better outcomes by addressing equity issues, they need to pay special attention to gender and the differing needs of farmersâ€”male, female, young, old, poor, and less poorâ€”by involving them at the project design stage. Our findings show the importance of additional project benefits unrelated to carbon income for addressing the requirements of equity perceived by both the implementing agency and women themselves.","Sustainable development,Social science,Social exclusion,Public economics,Payment for ecosystem services,Food security,Equity (finance),Economics,Economic growth,Climate change mitigation,Carbon project,Agriculture,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Social influence,Public economics,Property rights,Program Design Language,Village communities,Socioeconomics,Natural resource,Service provider,Public policy,Payment for ecosystem services,Resource scarcity,Property rights,Natural resource economics,Social equality,Poverty,Payment for ecosystem services,Social equality,Private equity fund,Payment,Service provider,Public economics,Payment,Social change,Legitimacy,Incentive,Vegetation,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Southeast asia","Jean Lee,Adrian Martin,Patti Kristjanson,Eva Wollenberg,Jesse C.

4,Evaluating the potential financial contributions of carbon farming to grazing enterprises in Western NSW,2019-01-01,Rangeland Journal,10.1071/RJ18032,"This article reports on modelling of the farm-level financial implications of changing land use from rangelands grazing to ‘carbon farming’ (vegetation-based carbon sequestration) in north-western New South Wales, Australia. Four model farm businesses were created by combining information from existing carbon projects funded under the Australian Government’s Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF), data from surveys of farm businesses in the study regions and biomass estimations from the pasture growth model, GRASP. Scenarios for each of the businesses were: baseline (current grazing system); clearing vegetation to increase carrying capacity; establishing a carbon project; and establishing a carbon project and reinvesting some of the additional income in exclusion fencing to increase carrying capacity on non-project areas. The carbon project scenarios were based on either of two approved carbon sequestration methodologies within the ERF: avoided deforestation; and human-induced regeneration. In comparing the financial outcomes of these scenarios across the modelled businesses, we found potential advantages for landholders in having projects where livestock carrying capacity was at medium to low levels for the study region and where woody vegetation biomass potential was medium to high for the region. The case for sequestration projects on land with higher carrying capacity and therefore higher opportunity cost was much less compelling. In most cases, reinvestment in exclusion fencing resulted in similar financial returns to just having a carbon project but farm business income increased in later years.","Opportunity cost,Land use,Greenhouse gas,Fencing,Deforestation,Carbon sequestration,Carbon project,Biology,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Subsidy,Natural resource economics,Incentive,Weed,Sustainable agriculture,Pollinator,Sustainability,Rangeland management,Rangeland,Measurement of biodiversity,Intact forest landscape,Habitat conservation,Wood production,Species richness,Monoculture,Net present value,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Interception,Restoration ecology,Reforestation,Forestry,Sustainable agriculture,Scholarship,Land use,Woodland,Stocking,Rangeland,Revegetation,Reforestation,Land use","Geoff Cockfield,Uttam Shrestha,Cathy Waters,Kenneth R.

5,Carbon Intensification and Poverty Reduction in Kenya: Lessons from the Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project,2013-01-01,Field Actions Science Reports. The journal of field actions,,"The Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project, implemented by the NGO Vi Agroforestry, is breaking new ground in designing and implementing climate finance projects in the agricultural sector. For the first time, while increasing agricultural productivity and enhancing resilience to climate change, smallholder farmers in Africa will receive benefits for greenhouse gas mitigation based on sustainable agricultural land management. The project has developed an activity monitoring system for sustainable agricultural land management (SALM) practices that enables smallholder famers and extension service provider to track and improve farm production. Based on the development of a carbon accounting methodology this system, in combination with a carbon model, is monitoring soil and biomass carbon sequestration consistent with the Verified Carbon Standard. As a result farmers in Africa for the first time can benefit from international voluntary carbon markets. The paper describes the Vi Agroforestry extension approach, outlines the project objectives and activities, and explains the carbon accounting methodology. Project achievements and lessons learned, but also the challenges that still lie ahead are presented. The authors conclude that the project model has great potential for scaling up and provide a potential blueprint for widespread adoption and effective monitoring of sustainable agricultural management in smallholder conditions.","Sustainable management,Natural resource economics,Greenhouse gas,Environmental protection,Climate Finance,Carbon project,Carbon accounting,Business,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural land,Greenhouse gas,Food security,Economics,Sustainability,Low-carbon economy,Land use, land-use change and forestry","Timm Tennigkeit,Katalin Solymosi,Matthias Seebauer,Bo Lager,Johannes Woelcke,J.

6,The global methane budget 2000-2012,2016-01-01,Earth System Science Data,10.5194/ESSD-8-697-2016,"Abstract. The global methane (CH4) budget is becoming an increasingly important component for managing realistic pathways to mitigate climate change. This relevance, due to a shorter atmospheric lifetime and a stronger warming potential than carbon dioxide, is challenged by the still unexplained changes of atmospheric CH4 over the past decade. Emissions and concentrations of CH4 are continuing to increase, making CH4 the second most important human-induced greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Two major difficulties in reducing uncertainties come from the large variety of diffusive CH4 sources that overlap geographically, and from the destruction of CH4 by the very short-lived hydroxyl radical (OH). To address these difficulties, we have established a consortium of multi-disciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate research on the methane cycle, and producing regular (∼ biennial) updates of the global methane budget. This consortium includes atmospheric physicists and chemists, biogeochemists of surface and marine emissions, and socio-economists who study anthropogenic emissions. Following Kirschke et al. (2013), we propose here the first version of a living review paper that integrates results of top-down studies (exploiting atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up models, inventories and data-driven approaches (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, and inventories for anthropogenic emissions, data-driven extrapolations). For the 2003–2012 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by top-down inversions at 558 Tg CH4 yr−1, range 540–568. About 60 % of global emissions are anthropogenic (range 50–65 %). Since 2010, the bottom-up global emission inventories have been closer to methane emissions in the most carbon-intensive Representative Concentrations Pathway (RCP8.5) and higher than all other RCP scenarios. Bottom-up approaches suggest larger global emissions (736 Tg CH4 yr−1, range 596–884) mostly because of larger natural emissions from individual sources such as inland waters, natural wetlands and geological sources. Considering the atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget, it is likely that some of the individual emissions reported by the bottom-up approaches are overestimated, leading to too large global emissions. Latitudinal data from top-down emissions indicate a predominance of tropical emissions (∼ 64 % of the global budget, The most important source of uncertainty on the methane budget is attributable to emissions from wetland and other inland waters. We show that the wetland extent could contribute 30–40 % on the estimated range for wetland emissions. Other priorities for improving the methane budget include the following: (i) the development of process-based models for inland-water emissions, (ii) the intensification of methane observations at local scale (flux measurements) to constrain bottom-up land surface models, and at regional scale (surface networks and satellites) to constrain top-down inversions, (iii) improvements in the estimation of atmospheric loss by OH, and (iv) improvements of the transport models integrated in top-down inversions.

7,Global CO 2 emissions from cement production,2017-01-01,Earth System Science Data,10.5194/ESSD-10-195-2018,"Abstract. The global production of cement has grown very rapidly in recent years, and after fossil fuels and land-use change, it is the third-largest source of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. The required data for estimating emissions from global cement production are poor, and it has been recognised that some global estimates are significantly inflated. Here we assemble a large variety of available datasets and prioritise official data and emission factors, including estimates submitted to the UNFCCC plus new estimates for China and India, to present a new analysis of global process emissions from cement production. We show that global process emissions in 2016 were 1.45±0.20 Gt CO2, equivalent to about 4 % of emissions from fossil fuels. Cumulative emissions from 1928 to 2016 were 39.3±2.4 Gt CO2, 66 % of which have occurred since 1990. Emissions in 2015 were 30 % lower than those recently reported by the Global Carbon Project.

9,The Global Methane Budget 2000–2017,2020-01-01,Earth System Science Data,10.5194/ESSD-2019-128,"Abstract. Understanding and quantifying the global methane (CH4) budget is important for assessing realistic pathways to mitigate climate change. Atmospheric emissions and concentrations of CH4 are continuing to increase, making CH4 the second most important human-influenced greenhouse gas in terms of climate forcing, after carbon dioxide (CO2). Assessing the relative importance of CH4 in comparison to CO2 is complicated by its shorter atmospheric lifetime, stronger warming potential, and atmospheric growth rate variations over the past decade, the causes of which are still debated. Two major difficulties in reducing uncertainties arise from the variety of geographically overlapping CH4 sources and from the destruction of CH4 by short-lived hydroxyl radicals (OH). To address these difficulties, we have established a consortium of multi-disciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate new research aimed at improving and regularly updating the global methane budget. Following Saunois et al. (2016), we present here the second version of the living review paper dedicated to the decadal methane budget, integrating results of top-down studies (atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up estimates (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven extrapolations). For the 2008–2017 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by atmospheric inversions (top-down approach) to be 572 Tg CH4 yr−1 (range 538–593, corresponding to the minimum and maximum estimates of the ensemble), of which 357 Tg CH4 yr−1 or ~ 60 % are attributed to anthropogenic sources (range 50–65 %). This total emission is 27 Tg CH4 yr−1 larger than the value estimated for the period 2000–2009 and 24 Tg CH4 yr−1 larger than the one reported in the previous budget for the period 2003–2012 (Saunois et al. 2016). Since 2012, global CH4 emissions have been tracking the carbon intensive scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Gidden et al., 2019). Bottom-up methods suggest larger global emissions (737 Tg CH4 yr−1, range 583–880) than top-down inversion methods, mostly because of larger estimated natural emissions from sources such as natural wetlands, other inland water systems, and geological sources. However the strength of the atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget, suggest that these bottom-up emissions are overestimated. The latitudinal distribution of atmospheric-based emissions indicates a predominance of tropical emissions (~ 65 % of the global budget, The data presented here can be downloaded from ICOS ( https://doi.org/10.18160/GCP-CH4-2019 ) and the Global Carbon Project.","Radiative forcing,Methane,Inversion (meteorology),Greenhouse gas,Geology,Climatology,Climate change,Carbon project,Carbon dioxide,Atmospheric chemistry,Representative Concentration Pathways,Radiative forcing,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report,Thematic map,Satellite imagery,Remote sensing,Wetland,Water extraction,Surface water,Tropical peat,Peat,Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer,Tropospheric ozone,Tonne,Pollutant,Greenhouse gas,Fossil fuel,Environmental science,Yedoma,Permafrost carbon cycle,Permafrost,Waste management,Renewable natural gas,Natural gas,Vulnerability,Sustainable development,Land use,Workover,Waste management,Natural gas","Marielle Saunois,Ann R.

For Africa, carbon sequestration also represents an opportunity to fund sustainable development through financial inflows. However, with a low share of global carbon trade, there are strong concerns that African countries are losing out on this valuable opportunity. Through a comprehensive review of 23 carbon sequestration projects across 14 countries, this paper discusses ways to overcome critical challenges to scale up carbon investments in Africa. These projects are expected to sequester 26.85 million tCO2 beyond the baseline situation. Within the continent, East Africa is the preferred destination for carbon investors. Most projects are non-Kyoto compliant and represent voluntary emission reductions. While project benefits such as increased local incomes and improved natural resources are promising, there are concerns that conversion of grasslands into tree plantations can harm local ecosystems. Insecure land tenure constrains new investments and increases the risk that local communities will lose access to forests. Another challenge is that projects with smallholders have high transaction costs. These costs can be overcome by building strong community institutions and simplifying project guidelines. To attract more projects, African governments will need to build their capacity to identify relevant opportunities.","Sustainable development,Natural resource,Land tenure,Kyoto Protocol,Global warming,Forestry,Emissions trading,Economics,Carbon sequestration,Carbon project","Rohit Jindal,Brent Swallow,John Kerr,N.

Understanding who uses these models and conditions associated with use is critical for increasing their impact. We tracked use of The Natural Capital Project's InVEST models and observed 19 different models were run 43,363 times in 104 countries over a 25-month period. Models for regulating services were most commonly used. We analyzed relationships between country-level variables and use of models and found capacity (population, GDP, Internet and computer access, and InVEST trainings), governance, biodiversity, and conservation spending are positively correlated with use. Civic involvement in conservation, carbon project funding, and forest cover are not correlated with use. Using multivariate statistical models, we analyzed which combinations of country-level variables best explain use of InVEST and found further evidence that variables related to capacity are the strongest predictors. Finally, we examined InVEST trainings in detail and found a significant effect of trainings on subsequent use of InVEST models. Our results indicate the general capacity of a country may limit uptake and use of decision support tools such as InVEST. Model-specific trainings are only one form of capacity building likely required for models to have desired levels of use and policy impact.","Population,Natural capital,Land use,Environmental economics,Ecosystem services,Economics,Decision support system,Corporate governance,Carbon project,Capacity building,Actuarial science,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Statistical model,Spatial analysis,Simple linear regression,Worldwide Governance Indicators,Scale (social sciences),Public sector,Statistics,Statistical model,Regression,Impact factor,Human welfare,Environmental resource management,Total human ecosystem,Resource management,Natural resource,Strategic planning,Sketch,Natural capital,Natural capital,National accounts,Incentive,World wide fund,South asia,Research council,Survey methodology,Research design,Quantitative psychological research","Stephen Posner,Gregory Verutes,Insu Koh,Doug Denu,Taylor Ricketts,Millenium Ecosystem Assessment,Michael J.

However, in some tropical countries, growth models for fast-growing tree species have been developed only recently. Additionally, environmental services of forests gain importance and should be integrated in forest management decisions. We determine the impact of a joint production of timber and carbon sequestration on the optimal rotation of a fast-growing species in north-western Ecuador, comparing different optimization approaches and taking the latest developments of the Kyoto Protocol into account. We find that payments for carbon sequestration have substantial impact on the rotation length: in contrast to an optimum of 15 years when focusing on timber production only, joint production leads to a doubling of the rotation length, which means that timber harvest should be postponed until the end of the carbon project.","Kyoto Protocol,Hardwood timber production,Forestry,Forest management,Ecosystem services,Economics,Carbon sink,Carbon sequestration,Carbon project,Afforestation","Roland Olschewski,Pablo C.

Recent reports by the Global Carbon Project highlight large uncertainties around land surface processes such as land use change, strength of CO2 fertilization, nutrient limitation and supply, and response to variability in climate. Process-based land surface models are well-suited to address these complex and emerging global change problems, but will require extensive development and evaluation. The coupled Canadian Land Surface Scheme and Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CLASS-CTEM) framework has been under continuous development by Environment and Climate Change Canada since 1987. As the open-source model of code development has revolutionized the software industry, scientific software is experiencing a similar evolution. Given the scale of the challenge facing land surface modellers, and the benefits of open-source, or community model, development, we have transitioned CLASS-CTEM from an internally developed model to an open-source community model, which we call the Canadian Land Surface Scheme including Biogeochemical Cycles (CLASSIC) v. 1.0. CLASSIC contains many technical features specifically designed to encourage community use including software containerization for serial and parallel simulations, extensive benchmarking software and data (Automated Model Benchmarking; AMBER), self-documenting code, community standard formats for model inputs and outputs, amongst others. Here we evaluate and benchmark CLASSIC against 31 FLUXNET sites where the model has been tailored to the site-level conditions and driven with observed meteorology. Future versions of CLASSIC will be developed using AMBER and these initial benchmark results to evaluate model performance over time. CLASSIC remains under active development and the code, site-level benchmarking data, software container and AMBER are freely available for community use.","Software,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Global change,FluxNet,Environmental resource management,Computer science,Climatology,Climate change,Carbon project,Canadian Land Surface Scheme,Benchmarking","Joe R.

New tech will help, but the complications are many. To escape the worst ravages of climate change, humans have a steep path to climb. The Paris climate accord negotiated in 2015 aims to limit global warming to below 2 °C, and ideally no more than 1.5 °C, requiring rapid and deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Even assuming the big emitters make the necessary commitments, researchers and policymakers will need to monitor emissions closely to catch any stumble. If countries stray too far from their targets, there may not be time to make up ground before the Earth hits catastrophic climate tipping points. As shown in this artist’s conception, NASA’s GeoCarb mission, planned for a 2021 launch, will map concentrations of carbon gases from a high, geostationary orbit, allowing it to scan across an area the size of the continental United States every 2 hours or so. Image courtesy of NASA/Lockheed Martin/University of Oklahoma. At the moment, national emissions are calculated by accountants, based on the activity in different economic sectors. Coal-fired power stations emit close to 1 kilogram of CO2 per kilowatt hour of electricity generated, so multiply that emission factor by the total energy generation and you get overall emissions. Doing the same for manufacturers, farms, and other emission sources gives the national total. In developed nations, this bottom-up accounting process estimates CO2 totals with claimed uncertainties of about 5%, says Riley Duren at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, CA, who leads the Megacities Carbon Project.

To understand the future evolution of the climate system and find ways to manage the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the processes and feedbacks that drive the carbon cycle must first be understood. However, our current knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns is uncertain, particularly over land and in regions of potentially high sensitivity to change like the boreal zone. The European Space Agency (ESA) GLOBCARBON project aims to generate fully calibrated estimates of at-land products quasi-independent of the original Earth Observation source for use primarily in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models, but also as a contribution to the Global Carbon Project, a cooperation between the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme, International Human Dimensions Programme and the World Climate Research Programme to aid understanding of global carbon cycling. The service will feature estimation of global burned area, the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), leaf area index (LAI) and Vegetation Growth Cycle. The demonstrator will focus on ten complete years, from 1998 to 2007 when overlap exists between ESA Earth Observation sensors and others that are synergistic. However, the system will be flexible so that it is not dependent on any single satellite sensor and therefore can be retrospectively applied to existing archives and used with future satellite sensors.","International Human Dimensions Programme,International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme,Greenhouse gas,Environmental resource management,Economics,Earth observation,Climate change,Carbon project,Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere,Carbon cycle,Physics,Climatology,Climate change,Special Report on Emissions Scenarios,Political economy of climate change,Morita therapy,Subglacial lake,Paleoclimatology,Oceanography,Runaway climate change,Meteorology,Global warming,Seasonality,Respiration,Northern Hemisphere,Terrestrial ecosystem,Primary production,Land use,Tonne,Soil water,Soil carbon,Vulcanian eruption,Volcano,Vegetation,Water balance,Vegetation,Seasonality,Vegetation,Thematic Mapper,Subpixel rendering","Stephen Plummer,Olivier Arino,Muriel Simon,Will Steffen,David J.

Two case studies, each at a different scale, are presented. First, the N’hambita Community Carbon Project in Mozambique, a REDD+ project, promoted agro-forestry and reforestation activities along with alternative livelihoods. Second, the Sloping Lands Conversion Programme (SLCP) in China is a national-level reforestation scheme to supply watershed services. Impacts on the poor are addressed through the ‘lens’ of a rural household allocating its labour supply to different income sources. Four aspects of REDD+ policy are discussed: the incentives necessary for ensuring the cost-effective, long-run sustainability of both carbon sinks and incomes; the implications for forest conservation, in particular biodiversity; the need for scaling up carbon sequestration activities in order to minimise carbon leakage; and, the possibilities to maximise the participation of the poor and alleviate poverty.

Using a mixed methods approach including rigorous content analysis coupled with descriptive statistics on 56 Alliance project design documents, this paper seeks to understand: 1) the extent to which projects seeking Alliance certification responded to the standards criteria requiring local community participation in the project development process; and, 2) how the Alliance certification standards can serve as an instrument for procedural justice and thus contribute to narrowing the social justice gap in global forest governance. We find that while the standards could potentially help address this governance gap by serving as standards of justice, evidence suggests that projects are not fulfilling requirements to facilitate procedural justice. We suggest that the lack of information and attention to stakeholder processes represents a substantial hurdle for facilitating procedural justice for impacted communities, suggesting that forest carbon (including REDD+) projects may result in the same threats to communities and livelihoods as past forest governance interventions. Furthermore, our findings signal the possibility of future credibility problems for the Alliance.","Stakeholder,Socioeconomics,Procedural justice,Local community,Environmental resource management,Environmental justice,Economics,Corporate governance,Certification,Carbon project,Alliance,Sociology,Social contract,Rationality,Tragedy of the commons,Tragedy of the anticommons,Natural resource,Sociology,Social control,Public administration,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Social change,Tragedy of the commons,Public good,Political science,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Participatory rural appraisal,Virtual space,Sociology,Social science,Theory of criminal justice,Social science,Reflexivity,Social responsibility,Public administration,Politics,Supply chain,Social responsibility,Public relations","Kimberly R.

18,Exploring Opportunities for Promoting Synergies between Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation in Forest Carbon Initiatives,2016-01-01,Forests,10.3390/F7010024,"There is growing interest in designing and implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation (M + A) in synergy in the forest and land use sectors. However, there is limited knowledge on how the planning and promotion of synergies between M + A can be operationalized in the current efforts to mitigate climate change through forest carbon. This paper contributes to fill this knowledge gap by exploring ways of planning and promoting M + A synergy outcomes in forest carbon initiatives. It examines eight guidelines that are widely used in designing and implementing forest carbon initiatives. Four guiding principles with a number of criteria that are relevant for planning synergy outcomes in forest carbon activities are proposed. The guidelines for developing forest carbon initiatives need to demonstrate that (1) the health of forest ecosystems is maintained or enhanced; (2) the adaptive capacity of forest-dependent communities is ensured; (3) carbon and adaptation benefits are monitored and verified; and (4) adaptation outcomes are anticipated and planned in forest carbon initiatives. The forest carbon project development guidelines can encourage the integration of adaptation in forest carbon initiatives. However, their current efforts guiding projects and programs to deliver biodiversity and environmental benefits, ecosystem services, and socioeconomic benefits are not considered explicitly as efforts towards enhancing adaptation. An approach for incentivizing and motivating project developers, guideline setters, and offset buyers is imperative in order to enable existing guidelines to make clear contributions to adaptation goals. We highlight and discuss potential ways of incentivizing and motivating the explicit planning and promotion of adaptation outcomes in forest carbon initiatives.","Operationalization,Land use,Guiding Principles,Forest ecology,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Climate change mitigation,Carbon project,Biology,Adaptive capacity,Global warming,Food systems,Food security,Tropics,Tropical agriculture,Subsistence agriculture,Psychological resilience,Management by objectives,Livelihood,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Revenue,Property rights,Livelihood,Latin Americans,Greenhouse gas,Reliability engineering,Business,Adaptive capacity,Mainstreaming,Logging,Global warming,Environmental resource management,Economics,Adaptive capacity,Systems thinking,Public policy,Paradigm shift,Kyoto Protocol,International community,Geography","Eugene L.

This is the case for tropical hydroelectric dams, which are now a major destination for funds under the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The countries that purchase the credit generated by dams can emit more greenhouse gases without their being offset by genuine mitigation. The limited funds available for mitigation are also wasted on subsidizing dams that would be built anyway. Tropical dams also emit substantially more greenhouse gases than are recognized in CDM accounting procedures. Tropical hydroelectric emissions are also undercounted in national inventories of greenhouse gases under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, giving them a role in undermining the effectiveness of as-yet undecided emission limits.

The instrumental variables used for forest dependence were: household head born in the village, duration of residence of the household head in the village, ethnicity of the household head, business ownership of the household head and off-farm income of the household. The results show that education of household head and households' trust towards community members positively influenced household participation in PES, while forest dependence influenced it negatively.

Peak GHG flux was observed at rehabilitating (32.8 ± 2.1 Mg CO2e ha−1 y−1) and intact, mature reference sites (43.8 ± 4.5 Mg CO2e ha−1 y−1) and a dry, exposed disused aquaculture pond (30.6 ± 1.9 Mg CO2e ha−1 y−1). Emissions were negligible at low productivity rehabilitating sites with high hydroperiod (mean 1.0 ± 0.1 Mg CO2e ha−1 y−1) and an impounded, operational aquaculture pond (1.1 ± 0.2 Mg CO2e ha−1 y−1). Heterogeneity in biophysical conditions and geomorphic position exerted a strong influence on GHG flux, with the longer hydroperiod and higher soil moisture content of seaward fringing mangroves correlated with decreased fluxes. A greater abundance of Mud lobster mounds and root structures in landward mangroves correlated to higher flux. When viewed across a landuse change continuum, our results suggest that the initial conversion of mangroves to aquaculture ponds releases extremely high rates of GHGs. Furthermore, the re-institution of hydrological regimes in dry, disused aquaculture ponds to facilitate tidal flushing is instrumental in rapidly mediating GHG flux, leading to a significant reduction in baseline emissions. This is an important consideration for forest carbon project proponents seeking to maximise creditable GHG emissions reductions and removals.","Water content,Mangrove,Hydrology,Greenhouse gas,Flux,Environmental engineering,Chemistry,Carbon project,Carbon dioxide,Bioturbation,Aquaculture,Radiative forcing,Environmental science,Atmospheric sciences,Tropics,Mangrove restoration,Mangrove,Greenhouse gas,Environmental protection,Ecosystem services,Total organic carbon,Primary production,Oceanography,Wetland,Mangrove,Land use,Total organic carbon,Primary production,Plant litter,Mangrove,Greenhouse gas,Ecology,Temperate rainforest,Temperate forest,Taiga,Restoration ecology,Mangrove restoration,Mangrove,Soil organic matter,Primary production,Primary producers","Clint Cameron,Lindsay B.

The objective of this paper is to analyze existing market demand for carbon credits and review existing institutions supporting demand generation. Existing carbon demand is driven primarily by regulated, and to a lesser extent, non-regulated or voluntary markets. While regulated carbon markets are potentially large and driven by the Kyoto Protocol, the challenge for a forestry-based carbon project in Panama is its ability to meet CDM regulated constraints. The challenge in non-regulated carbon markets is identifying potential consumers in an extremely fragmented market. While there is significant demand for carbon credits, meeting demand for carbon credits in the regulated and voluntary markets from forestry-based carbon sequestration projects will remain a challenge. Landowners may have options to pursue these markets; however, reforestation and afforestation project profitability and viability will be dependent on how carbon mar...","Supply and demand,Reforestation,Profitability index,Kyoto Protocol,Environmental resource management,Carbon sequestration,Carbon project,Carbon finance,Carbon credit,Biology,Primary market,Market price,International economics,Political economy of climate change,Geography,Environmental resource management,Kyoto Protocol,Joint Implementation,International economics,Supply side,Private sector,Perfect information,Tropics,Introduced species,Ecotype,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Kyoto Protocol","Sandra Lauterbach,Karan Capoor,Philippe Ambrosi,Sadaf Alam,Franck Lecocq,Michael Lichtenfeld,Jesse Muir Grossman,Alexander Hovani,Mike Fotos",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J091v25n01_04,12,carbon project agriculture

As one of the energetically most intensive industries, construction industry is a key area to promote decarbonization, which is an important path to realize national strategic goals on carbon reduction in China. This paper focuses on low carbon technology integration management, and analyzes the existing research status of green building or low carbon buildings on the related evaluation indexes, then proposes an evaluation system framework for the low carbon technology integration innovation from the perspective of the system management. It points out, that t he evaluation of low carbon technology innovation should be conducted by a smarter managing of system resource input, the process control and the system comprehensive performance as an output . Furthermore, based on the questionnaire survey and the exploratory factor analysis result on the selected indexes, this paper implements a rough set method to identify the weight of all the indexes and found that:(1) managers focus more on the affordable input of the beginning stage and the management control in the middle period of the innovation, instead on the output performance in the later stage . This indicates, that the management control during the front stages is more essential than this during the later ones; (2) the constructed evaluation framework, from the system perspective, can properly reflect the integrity, multi-level stakeholder structure and technology integration in low carbon projects , which could support the decision-maker into considering the complexity of construction and evaluation of the technology innovation performance from multi-level perspective; (3) the combined methods, adopted with exploratory factor analysis and rough set evaluation to determine the evaluation index and its weights, could well reflect the overall performance of low carbon project evaluation, the selected indicators have certain scientific and practical effectiveness , which could provide references for enterprise on LCT innovation management. as an industry with a multi-level technologies integration, the single Technological adoption or innovation cannot satisfy the economic transformation requirements of the modern construction industry development. An integration innovation management evaluation model is needed for the sustainability evaluation in the construction practice. Its development is the main scientific objective of this study, by taking into consideration the entire life cycle assessment and various other factors.","Technology integration,Systems management,Sustainability,Stakeholder,Process management,Management science,Management control system,Low-carbon economy,Innovation management,Environmental resource management,Engineering,Carbon project,Statistical analysis,Project management,Project engineering,Mathematics,Mathematical optimization,Machine learning,Waste treatment,Supply chain,Property management,The Conceptual Framework,TOPSIS,Rough set,International standard,Geography,Environmental resource management,Sustainability,Photovoltaic system,Heating system,Rough set,Mathematics,Fuzzy set operations,Third party certification,Sustainability,Strategic approach,Standardization,Purchasing,Global climate,Schedule (project management),Risk analysis (engineering),Project portfolio management","Xiaodong Lai,Jixian Liu,Georgi Georgiev,Robert F.

31,"Cost to produce Carbon credits by reducing the harvest level in British Columbia, Canada",2015-01-01,Forest Policy and Economics,10.1016/J.FORPOL.2014.12.002,"This paper uses the inventory of three actively managed forest estates located in the Coastal, Central Interior, and Northern Interior forest regions in British Columbia to estimate the cost to produce Carbon credits ($ per Carbon credit) when the harvest is reduced below the baseline level. The financial analysis was conducted over a range of discount rates (0–16%) and the total cost included the opportunity cost due to harvest reduction and the Carbon project cost (the Carbon project initial establishment and validation cost and the ongoing verification cost for two frequencies (1-year and 5-year)). When the opportunity cost was not included, the cost per Carbon credit was similar to previous findings (lower cost per Carbon credit for higher site index (i.e. top height in meters at age 50)). However, when the opportunity cost was included the cost per Carbon credit was higher for higher site indices which corresponded to higher average value per hectare harvested (AVHH) (i.e. timber revenue multiplied by average harvested volume per hectare per year). The reversal of trends is the result of the average timber revenue being higher for higher site indices which resulted in a higher opportunity cost and higher AVHH. The opportunity cost represented 58% to 97% of the cost per Carbon credit. Compared to the 5-year verification, the 1-year verification frequency increased the total cost per Carbon credit by 1% to 22%, with the smallest increase being when the Carbon project cost represented a small percent of the total cost. The estimates for the three forest estates analyzed here represent three points from a larger spectrum, and they identify the cost per Carbon credit over a range of site indices (14.7 to 25.6meters top height at age 50), AVHH (12.2 to 63.7thousand$ha−1year−1), and timber net revenues ($4 to $35m−3). Further research is required to determine if the trends found in this study hold over a more densely populated spectrum.","Total cost,Site index,Opportunity cost,Hectare,Forestry,Economics,Carbon project,Carbon price,Carbon offset,Carbon credit,Stern Review,Stern,Political economy of climate change,Soil carbon,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Greenhouse gas removal,Greenhouse gas,Environmental protection,Tree species,Spatial distribution,Realized niche width,Opportunity cost,Natural resource economics,Marginal cost,Subsidy,Natural resource economics,Incentive,Sustainable forest management,Forest management,Forest inventory,Natural resource economics,Marginal cost,Greenhouse effect,Western Hemlock,Tsuga,Northwest U.S.,Taiga,Soil organic matter,Soil carbon","Cosmin D.

However, lessons learnt from social science research on degradation narratives are not taken into consideration. This creates a risk of problematic degradation narratives being used to legitimise forest carbon projects. This study examined a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) forest plantation in Uganda, where incomplete and partly contradictory evidence on land use change was interpreted in a way that overemphasised degradation. This interpretation was in line with the interests of the forestry company proposing the CDM activity and with national interests in Uganda, and was stimulated by CDM guidelines and regulations. Our investigation revealed a more complex picture of land cover change in the area that did not support the narrative of an area undergoing continuous degradation. We therefore recommend that close scrutiny of the degradation narrative presented be included in every type of forest carbon project.","Scrutiny,Narrative,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land cover,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Economics,Deforestation,Climate change,Clean Development Mechanism,Carbon project,Sustainability,Poverty,Population growth,Remote sensing,Geography,Earth remote sensing,Vegetation,Tree cover,Spectroradiometer,Socio-ecological system,Psychological resilience,Perception,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Traditional knowledge,Political history,Landscape assessment,Technocracy,Public administration,Politics,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Stalemate,Negotiation,Socioeconomic development,Social science,Reforestation,Woodland,Political ecology,Natural resource","Flora Hajdu,Oskar Penje,Klara Fischer,Eric F.

The target of these carbon-offset initiatives is to satisfy the increasing demand of individuals wishing to take part in the fight against climate change. In this paper, we review and criticize these carbon-offsetting programs in general terms. We then propose an alternative that, in our opinion, should prove to be a better solution for citizens who are willing to pay for protecting the environment. This alternative is to organize citizens’ participation in carbon emissions trading on a large scale in order to purchase and retire (destroy) CO2 permits. To do so, a benevolent Regulator or non-governmental organization must correct certain CO2 emissions market failures; this particularly concerns the high transaction costs, which represent an entry barrier and prevent citizens from purchasing and withholding permits. Based on theoretical findings, we demonstrate that implementing citizens’ participation in emissions trading is an economically efficient and a morally preferable option","Transaction cost,Purchasing,Market failure,Greenhouse gas,Environmental resource management,Environmental economics,Emissions trading,Economics,Economic growth,Economic efficiency,Carbon project,Barriers to entry,Sympathy,Social pressure,Public good,Tragedy of the commons,Tragedy of the anticommons,Social trap,Ricardian equivalence,Neutrality,Microeconomics,Volatility (finance),Safety valve,Price floor,Public economics,Pigovian tax,Externality,Negotiation,Kyoto Protocol,Inversion (meteorology),Sulfur dioxide,Strategic bidding,Pollution,Welfare economics,Scrutiny,Resource allocation,Welfare economics,Microeconomics,Marginal utility,Natural resource economics,Metropolitan area,Market power","Olivier Rousse,James Andreoni,Garrett Hardin,James Andreoni,Henry D.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas (GHG) and also an ozone-depleting substance that has both natural and anthropogenic sources. Large uncertainty remains on the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of N2O fluxes and the key drivers of N2O production in the terrestrial biosphere. Some terrestrial biosphere models have been evolved to account for nitrogen processes and show the capability to simulate N2O emissions from land ecosystems at the global scale, but large discrepancies exist among their estimates primarily due to inconsistent input data sets, simulation protocol, and model structure and parameterization schemes. Based on the consistent model input data and simulation protocol, the global N2O Model Inter-Comparison Project (NMIP) was initialized with ten state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models with N cycling included. Specific objectives of NMIP are to: 1) Unravel the major N cycling processes controlling N2O fluxes in each model and identify the uncertainty sources from model structure, input data and parameters; 2) Quantify the magnitude, spatial and temporal patterns of global and regional N2O fluxes from the pre-industrial period (1860) to present, and attribute the relative contributions of multiple environmental factors to N2O dynamics; and 3) Provide a bench-marking estimate of N2O fluxes through synthesizing the multi-model simulation results and existing estimates from ground-based observations, inventories, and statistical and empirical extrapolations. This study provides detailed descriptions for the NMIP protocol, input data, model structure and key parameters, along with preliminary simulation results. The global and regional N2O estimation derived from the NMIP is a key component of the Global N2O Budget activity jointly led by the Global Carbon Project (GCP) and the International Nitrogen Initiative (INI).","Physics,Parametrization,Greenhouse gas,Ecosystem,Data set,Climatology,Carbon project,Biosphere,Nutrient cycle,Nutrient,Environmental resource management,Terrestrial ecosystem,Radiative forcing,Nitrogen,Precipitation,Northern Hemisphere,Last Glacial Maximum,Spatial ecology,Parametrization,Offset (computer science),Soil water,Nitrogen cycle,Manure,Tropics,Precipitation,La Niña","Hanqin Tian,Jia Yang,Chaoqun Lu,Rongting Xu,Josep G.

We rely on the Carbon Disclosure Project as a sustainability initiative supported by institutional investors. Greenhouse gas emissions measurement and its disclosure to investors can be thought of as a first step toward addressing climate change issues and reducing the firm’s carbon footprint. Based on a sample of publicly listed Canadian firms over the period 2008–2014, we find that the likelihood of voluntary climate change disclosure increases with women percentage on boards. We also find evidence that supports critical mass theory with regard to board gender diversity.

36,Terrestrial Fluxes of Carbon in GCP Carbon Budgets.,2020-01-01,Global Change Biology,10.1111/GCB.15050,"The Global Carbon Project (GCP) has published global carbon budgets annually since 2007 (Canadell et al. [2007], Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, 18866-18870; Raupach et al. [2007], Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 104, 10288-10293). There are many scientists involved, but the terrestrial fluxes that appear in the budgets are not well understood by ecologists and biogeochemists outside of that community. The purpose of this paper is to make the terrestrial fluxes of carbon in those budgets more accessible to a broader community. The GCP budget is composed of annual perturbations from pre-industrial conditions, driven by addition of carbon to the system from combustion of fossil fuels and by transfers of carbon from land to the atmosphere as a result of land use. The budget includes a term for each of the major fluxes of carbon (fossil fuels, oceans, land) as well as the rate of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere. Land is represented by two terms: one resulting from direct anthropogenic effects (Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry or land management) and one resulting from indirect anthropogenic (e.g., CO2 , climate change) and natural effects. Each of these two net terrestrial fluxes of carbon, in turn, is composed of opposing gross emissions and removals (e.g., deforestation and forest regrowth). Although the GCP budgets have focused on the two net terrestrial fluxes, they have paid little attention to the gross components, which are important for a number of reasons, including understanding the potential for land management to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and understanding the processes responsible for the sink for carbon on land. In contrast to the net fluxes of carbon, which are constrained by the global carbon budget, the gross fluxes are largely unconstrained, suggesting that there is more uncertainty than commonly believed about how terrestrial carbon emissions will respond to future fossil fuel emissions and a changing climate.","Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Land management,Greenhouse gas,Fossil fuel,Deforestation,Climatology,Climate change,Carbon project,Biology,Atmospheric sciences,Tropics,Taiga,Subtropics,Tropical climate,Sink (computing),Forest inventory,Natural hazard,Greenhouse gas,Forest ecology,Population,Natural resource economics,Kaya identity,Radiative forcing,Greenhouse gas,Environmental science,Tropics,Tropical climate,Stock (geology),Vegetation,Tropics,Tropical deforestation,Geology,Energy statistics,Deforestation,Vegetation,Primary production,Precipitation,Vegetation,Sink (computing),Latitude","Richard A.

38,Re-Assessment of Forest Carbon Balance in Southeast Asia: Policy Implications for REDD+,2014-01-01,Low carbon economy,10.4236/LCE.2014.54016,"Southeast Asia is rich in tropical forests and biodiversity but rapid deforestation and forest degradation have accelerated climate change and threatened sustainable development in the region. Carbon emission reductions through reducing deforestation and forest degradation, forest conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+) have been a focal topic of the climate change mitigation since the Bali in 2007. However, only a handful of studies exist so far on this important issue that are suitable to inform the debate with estimates of carbon stocks and emission reductions or removals as a result of REDD+. Our study attempts to analyze the potential emission reductions and removals for a 35-year period under the REDD+ scheme. We start by developing land use change and forest harvesting models that are used to estimate carbon stock changes in natural forests and forest plantations in Southeast Asia. Carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation of natural forests were 1865.1, 1611.4, and 1300.4 TgCO2 year-1, respectively. With a hypothetical carbon project of 35 years beginning from 2015, carbon emission reductions were estimated at 817.6 TgCO2 year-1, of which about 10% was from reducing forest degradation. Carbon removals due to increase of forest plantations were 76.3 TgCO2 year-1 but the removals could be much higher if there is a new definition on the eligibility of forest plantations. Summing up together, about 893.9 TgCO2 of carbon credits could be achieved from implementing carbon project in Southeast Asia or about US $6.6 billion annually between 2015 and 2050 if carbon price in 2012 is used. In addition to reducing emissions, there are other benefits from carbon project implementation. This study suggests that REDD+ has great potential for reducing carbon emissions and enhancing carbon stocks in the forests. Without financial incentives, carbon project would not happen and therefore climate change will continue to threaten future development.","Land use, land-use change and forestry,Environmental science,Deforestation,Climate change mitigation,Carbon project,Carbon price,Carbon finance,Carbon credit,Biosequestration,Agroforestry,Landfill gas utilization,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas accounting,Working group,Scrutiny,Regional science,Tropical climate,Sink (computing),Forest inventory,Sink (computing),Plant cover,Land use,Stock (geology),Soil carbon,Secondary forest,Tanzania,Sampling (statistics),Forestry,Secondary forest,Old-growth forest,Logging,Tropical rainforest climate,Tropical deforestation,Geography,Terrestrial ecosystem,Land use,Land management,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Greenhouse gas","Vathana Khun,Nophea Sasaki,K.

39,Climate Change: New Trends and Projections,2009-01-01,Water Air and Soil Pollution,10.1007/S11270-007-9342-Z,"The two most dangerous problems facing humankind are (1) the excessive and expanding human population, and (2) anthropogenic greenhouse gas production. Of course the latter problem results from the former one, not the other way around, so a reduction in the number of humans on Earth will be required to solve any of our serious environmental problems. Hopefully, this will result from a decrease in the fertility rate rather than an increase in the death rate. But how serious is the problem of global warming, and what are the most recent trends and developments? Production of CO2 and other types of mangenerated pollution has been increasing dramatically in recent years. At the International Conference on Global Environmental Change in Beijing, November 2006, scientists reported that despite efforts to reduce carbon emissions, they have actually increased. Specifically, the report documented that in the period between 2000 and 2005 as compared with the period between 1990 and 1995, CO2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption increased by 400 PERCENT! The data were published by the Global Carbon Project (http://www.globalcarbonproject.org), a component of the Earth System Science Partnership. Dr Mike Raupach, Chair of the Global Carbon Project, noted that “The findings indicate that recent efforts to reduce emissions have had virtually no impact on emissions growth, and that effective caps are urgently needed.” Anthropogenic carbon dioxide release over the last 5 years are close to one of the more pessimistic emissions scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) called “A1B.” This scenario assumes that at least 50% of energy produced over the next century will come from fossil fuel consumption. The recent increases were attributed to the tremendous enhancement in fossil fuel consumption in China and India as well as the actions of the U.S. and Australia in disregarding and even undermining the efforts of the Kyoto Accord. Worse, assuming “business as usual,” the data suggest that at least an 8-fold increase in CO2 emissions will occur over the next 10 years. None of the recent projections had anticipated such a rapid rise in anthropogenic CO2 production. Most frighteningly, due to the phenomenon of environmental inertia, if and when anthropogenic emissions do begin to decrease, atmospheric CO2 will continue to rise for at least a century. Moreover, global temperatures will continue to increase for two or more centuries, locking the world into continuing Water Air Soil Pollut (2010) 205 (Suppl 1):S15–S16 DOI 10.1007/s11270-007-9342-z","Population,Natural resource economics,Kyoto Protocol,Greenhouse gas,Global warming,Environmental engineering,Environmental change,Earth system science,Climate change,Chemistry,Carbon project,Victimology,Social control,Political science,Subcutaneous fat,Muscle weight,Lumbar vertebrae","M.

Existing regulatory regimes, including on coastal protection, are still very useful tools to protect and conserve mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes, and preserve their carbon value and role. These approaches suffer, however, from ‘traditional’ issues such as lack of enforcement, human and financial constraints as well as unclear or misguiding government mandates. Successes are witnessed using a community-based carbon project approach, ensuring high stakeholder participation via direct or indirect incentive programmes. Comprehensive coastal zone management approaches seem very promising, but success overall, and regarding carbon specifically, are yet to be reported. The Paris Agreement has introduced new tools which could serve as means to trigger more and better coastal adaptation and mitigation efforts.

41,Driving forces for low carbon technology innovation in the building industry: A critical review,2017-01-01,Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews,10.1016/J.RSER.2017.02.044,"As a response to climate change, low carbon development has attracted a growing public attention. It is urgent to implement low carbon economy through technological innovation so that carbon emissions can be reduced effectively. The synergy and cooperation amongst the participants is required due to various challenges such as: multi-participants, multi-objectives and multi-technologies. These present significant challenges to the low carbon technology (LCT) innovation development. The objective of this study is to identify the relevant driving forces of LCT innovation and their interaction in the construction industry. This paper firstly analyzes the interrelationships of the participants via a methodology of system dynamics (SD) and questionnaire survey. The main driving forces and related influential factors are highlighted by means of a deductive method. Moreover, a SD model is established to examine the driving forces where government and private firms all play a role. The results show that LCT integration driving forces are significantly influenced by the continuous changes of a particular low carbon project as well as the number of participating enterprises. All the driving forces reflect an increasingly level of effectiveness. According to the model simulation, it will take a long period of time to transform traditional projects to low carbon projects. China needs at least 21 years that the quantity of low carbon buildings exceeds that of traditional ones. As a result, the building and construction industry is facing a significant challenge in terms of carbon emissions reduction. The numbers of enterprises participating in LCT innovation will not always increase with the enhancement of driving forces. Rather, it will keep at a stable level after a certain growth. A particular one single driving force has limited impact on the growth of low carbon projects and participating enterprises. System integration plays a crucial role to achieve the low carbon development.","System integration,System dynamics,Questionnaire,Operations management,Low-carbon economy,Industrial organization,Greenhouse gas,Government,Environmental resource management,Engineering,Climate change,Carbon project,Sociology,Social responsibility,Management,Public relations,Organizational studies,Organizational structure,Sustainability,Specific population,Social sustainability,Natural resource economics,Environmental science,Climate policy,Spite,Property crime,Poison control,Secondary sector of the economy,Potential market,Low energy,Population size,Natural resource economics,Greenhouse gas,Sustainability,Risk analysis (engineering),Renewable energy,Urbanization,Short run,Outsourcing,Supply and demand,Material selection,Greenhouse gas","Xiaodong Lai,Jixian Liu,Qian Shi,Georgi Georgiev,Guangdong Wu,Howard Rothmann Bowen,W.

42,Michael Raupach (1950-2015),2015-01-01,Nature Climate Change,10.1038/NCLIMATE2591,"Mike Raupach is best known around the world for his leading role in advancing our knowledge of the global carbon cycle, a crucial step in addressing the climate change challenge. Mike was a founding co-chair of the Global Carbon Project (GCP), a network of the world’s leading carbon cycle researchers, which aims to understand the role of humanity in changing the dynamics of the carbon cycle and to provide the insights needed to reduce our perturbation of the cycle. Under Mike’s leadership the GCP flourished. The annual carbon budget, which tracks changes in emissions of CO2, atmospheric concentration of CO2 and the strength of the marine and land carbon sinks, has become a landmark product of the GCP. It is backed up by a large body of state-of-theart research in both the natural and social sciences, ranging from studies of the processes that control natural carbon sinks to exploring the institutional and technical constraints slowing the transition towards decarbonized economies. Importantly, the GCP has analysed possible options for implementing a global carbon budget based on a blend of equity principles and achievability. Born in South Australia, Mike received his PhD in 1976 from Flinders University, Adelaide, in the area of micrometeorology. A postdoctoral position with the well-known micrometeorologist Alistair Thom at the University of Edinburgh followed. Mike returned to Australia in 1979 to take up a position with the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization) Division of Environmental Mechanics, in Canberra. Mike’s early career was focused on challenges much smaller than the global scale. He made major contributions to the study of the flow and transport of matter and energy through and above plant canopies. In particular, his work was part of the transition from using simple gradient-diffusion theory to describe canopy transport processes to embracing the physically more realistic turbulent transport of energy and matter. This required related research, to which Mike also made significant contributions, aimed at understanding turbulence as a coherent and organized process. This period in his career included quantification of CO2 transport through and above plant canopies, a forerunner of his later research interests, albeit at much smaller scales. The transition to focusing on larger scales, up to the global, came in the 1990s when Mike was appointed to the scientific steering committee of the Biospheric Aspects of the Hydrological Cycle core project of the IGBP (International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme). One of the most fundamental and important questions that the project addressed was: does the land-surface matter in climate and weather? Mike’s research greatly contributed to addressing that question, through his work on turbulent fluxes near the land surface, boundary-layer budgeting and quantifying the water balance at broader scales. His excellence in scientific research is not the only skill that enabled Mike to build such a brilliant career. He always had a warm and thoughtful way of collaborating with his colleagues. He showed respect and humility in interacting not only with them, but also with the policy world and the public. Mike’s communications skills were legendary. He could distil the most complex ideas into crisp, understandable stories. His words were carefully chosen, and his spoken sentences often carried the grace and power of expertly crafted written prose. His touchstone, however, was always the science, and in that he was unfailingly rigorous and insightful. Later in his career, this combination of skills — research excellence, communicating effectively to all audiences, and ability to assemble and gently steer groups of strong-minded scientists — put him in leadership positions in some very challenging projects. But in an Australian context, Mike was also very active in tackling some of the wicked problems that link the biophysical world with human societies, and was keenly interested in efforts to unify perspectives and research approaches from the natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities. He chaired the steering committee of the ‘Australia 2050’ project of the Australian Academy of Science (AAS). In 2009–2010 he chaired the Expert Working Group on Challenges at the Intersection of Carbon, Energy and Water, reporting to the Prime Minister’s Science, Engineering and Innovation Council and the Office of the Chief Scientist of Australia. Just before his death, Mike co-chaired the working group drafting the AAS booklet The Science of Climate Change: Questions and Answers. His skills and achievements were widely recognized. He was elected a Fellow of the AAS, the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering and the American Geophysical Union. He was also appointed to a CSIRO Fellowship. I worked with Mike for nearly 35 years, from the early days in CSIRO to February 2014, when he succeeded me as the executive director of the Climate Change Institute at the Australian National University. What I remember most about Mike was his uncanny ability to cut through the most complex of problems and distil them to their essence in understandable yet profoundly insightful ways, leaving one wondering “why couldn’t I think of that?”. Above all, he was a wonderful human being and will be sorely missed by the Earth System research community and by all those who knew him and worked with him. Mike passed away peacefully on 10 February 2015 after a short illness. He is survived by his wife, Hilary Talbot, and their three children, Tim, Anna and Alex. ❐","Scientific method,NASA Chief Scientist,Management,Humility,Excellence,Equity (finance),Environmental resource management,Earth system science,Commonwealth,Carbon project,Biology,Tribute,Saltation (geology),Meteorology","Will Steffen,Yaping Shao,William Nickling,Gilles Bergametti,Harry Butler,Adrian Chappell",https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/uploads/749206957ab141741c1598aae4fd90db.pdf,1,carbon project agriculture
43,Forest offsets and the California compliance market: Bringing an abstract ecosystem good to market,2016-01-01,Geoforum,10.1016/J.GEOFORUM.2016.06.021,"Abstract Improved Forest Management (IFM) projects under the California cap-and-trade market allow production of new, non-traditional commodities: forest carbon offsets. Earlier analyses have considered forest offsets generated through tree planting in the Global South, as vehicles for sustainable development. However, the California IFM program is testing offset production in new geographic and forest management contexts: with offsets produced and consumed within the US on working (timber producing) forests. With data drawn from California IFM project design documents and in-depth interviews with carbon project developers, this study traces the development, sale, and maintenance of forest offsets, in order to map access to benefits along the commodity chain. Results reveal that the cost and complexity of rendering biological services ‘real’ for market legitimacy are reducing benefits to marginal landowners, who lack needed capital, knowledge, and technology to bring offsets to market. An important insight of this study is that the state has maintained power over program participation and offset supply through control of the forest offset methodology, creating a production process largely mediated by the state, adding risk and uncertainty to market participation. Findings provide an empirical example of neoliberal nature and offer broader lessons on governance and benefit distribution for ecosystem service commodity chains.","Tree planting,Sustainable development,Forest management,Environmental resource management,Emissions trading,Economics,Commodity chain,Commodity,Carbon project,Carbon offset,Theoretical sampling,Sociology,Social science,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Social influence,Sociology,Qualitative research,Nursing,Tertiary sector of the economy,Restructuring,Pacific Rim,Sustainable development,Natural resource economics,Multi-level governance,Social science,Sectoral analysis,Restructuring,World economy,Social change,Political economy,Social identity theory,Situated,Profit (economics),United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Revenue,Property rights,Typology,Sociology,Social science","Erin Clover Kelly,Marissa Bongiovanni Schmitz,Anselm L.

44,Contributions of natural systems and human activity to greenhouse gas emissions,2018-01-01,Advances in Climate Change Research,10.1016/J.ACCRE.2018.12.003,"Abstract In this study, we conducted a literature review of relevant research and then statistically analyzed global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from natural systems, including forest fires, oceans, wetlands, permafrost, mud volcanoes, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Drawing on the Global Carbon Project (GCP) report, we also summarized the global anthropogenic GHG emissions. We then compared the global annual GHG emissions from natural systems with those generated by human activity. The results indicate that the global annual GHG emissions range approximately between 54.33 and 75.50 Gt CO2-eq, of which natural emissions account for 18.13–39.30 Gt CO2-eq, with the most likely value being approximately 29.07 Gt CO2-eq. According to the GCP report, the global anthropogenic emissions have increased from 22 Gt CO2-eq in 1990 to 36.2 Gt CO2-eq in 2016. The amounts of natural and anthropogenic GHGs emissions are roughly of the same order of magnitude. Anthropogenic emissions account for approximately 55.46% of the total global GHGs emissions (2016 value), i.e., the ratio of natural to anthropogenic emissions is approximately 0.8. In addition, the annual amount of GHGs absorbed by Earth systems (ocean and terrestrial ecosystems) ranges between approximately 14.4 Gt CO2-eq and 26.5 Gt CO2-eq, with natural system GHG emissions and sinks also having roughly the same order of magnitude. This finding indicates that the GHG emissions generated by human activity exert extra pressure on what is otherwise a self-balancing Earth system.","Wetland,Volcano,Terrestrial ecosystem,Permafrost,Mud volcano,Greenhouse gas,Environmental science,Earth system science,Carbon project,Atmospheric sciences,Goods and services,Geology,Fossil fuel,Trace gas,Meteorology,MOPITT,World Ocean Circulation Experiment,Total inorganic carbon,Revelle factor,Tropical peat,Peat,Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer,Sustainability,Political economy of climate change,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Yedoma,Total organic carbon,Thaw depth,Vegetation,Tropical peat,Total organic carbon,Wetland methane emissions,Methane,Greenhouse gas,Terrestrial ecosystem,Ecosystem,Ecology,Yedoma,Thermokarst,Thaw depth","Xi-Liu Yue,Qing-Xian Gao,Corinne Le Quéré,Michael R.

Analyzing livelihood impacts of forest carbon projects with evidence from India,2020-01-01,Land Use Policy,10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2020.104608,"Abstract Forest carbon projects, in addition to climate mitigation and conservation benefits, are expected to improve local livelihoods and contribute to poverty alleviation across developing countries. Despite substantial investments over last decade, there is limited empirical evidence on the livelihood impacts of these projects especially across different socioeconomic categories. This paper aims to contribute to this knowledge gap through an analysis of the livelihood impacts across small, medium and large categories of participating farmers in a forest carbon project from the state of Haryana in India. Data from 107 households have been analysed to study the impacts in terms of foregone crop, fodder and fuel wood benefits. The analysis suggests that the project has adversely affected the livelihoods of all three categories of farmers. However, small and marginal farmers are the most distressed due to their low incomes, asset base and risk-bearing capacities. It raises critical project design issues such as binding land use, delayed accrual of benefits, static opportunity costs and displacement of existing economic activities, which have serious livelihood and equity implications. Unless these issues are addressed and strong safety nets are provided, forest carbon projects might create more poverty than wellbeing for marginal communities.","Poverty,Opportunity cost,Natural resource economics,Livelihood,Land use,Equity (finance),Environmental resource management,Empirical evidence,Economics,Developing country,Carbon project,Stern Review,Stern,Political economy of climate change,Research questions,Qualitative research,Purpose Statement,Social research,Secondary research,Quantitative research,Limiting,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Greenhouse gas,Public economics,Land-use planning,Land titling,Sociology,Restructuring,Land grabbing,Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation,Public policy,Intact forest landscape,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Resource management,Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation,Land use,Greenhouse gas,Sustainability,Political economy of climate change,Kyoto Protocol","Ashish Aggarwal,Dan Brockington,Nicholas Stern,John W.

In the case of the Surui in Brazilian Amazonia's ""arc of defores- tation,"" these influences are leading to deforestation and log- ging that threaten both the forest and the sustainability of the group's productive systems. The Surui tribal leadership has initiated a proposal for an economic alternative based on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD). This has become a key case in global discussions on indigenous participation in REDD. The realism of the baseline scenario that serves as a reference for determining the amount of deforestation and emissions avoided by the proposed project is critical to assuring the reality of the carbon benefits claimed. Here we examine the SIMSURUI model, its input parameters and the implications of the Surui Forest Carbon Project for indigenous participation in climate mitiga- tion efforts.","Sustainability,Rainforest,Indigenous,Global warming,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Economics,Deforestation,Climate change,Carbon project,Amazon rainforest,Rainforest,Protected area,Land management,Geography,Variational Monte Carlo,Quantum Monte Carlo,Physics,Geography,Sampling (statistics),Greenhouse gas,Forest degradation,Woodland,Reforestation,Population growth,Vulnerability,Psychological resilience,Participatory action research,Transparency (graphic),Strengths and weaknesses,Future climate,Water cycle,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use","Claudia Suzanne Marie Nathalie Vitel,Gabriel Cardoso Carrero,Mariano Colini Cenamo,Maya Leroy,Paulo Mauricio Lima A.

Work is underway to bridge this gap via measures like streamlining project development and providing capacity building in target countries, yet progress remains slow.

53,Carbon sequestration potential in agroforestry system in India: an analysis for carbon project,2016-01-01,Agroforestry Systems,10.1007/S10457-015-9840-8,"India is a large developing country with more than seventy per cent population earning their livelihood from diverse land use activities. Changing climate is a worry for the nation but the country cannot afford to slow down the developing/developmental activities. Landuse activities in irrigated agro-ecosystems have started shifting from traditional agriculture to smart agriculture to meet the country’s food requirements and secure livelihood security. But this shift has been achieved at the cost of natural resources and degradation of environment. Realizing the benefits of climate smart agriculture in the changing scenario, farmers are adapting slowly to it but appropriate details of climate vulnerability and package of climate smart agriculture including tree-crop interaction are very limited for adoption. It is important to assess the strengths and weaknesses of carbon sequestration (CS) projects with respect to their practical potential rather than biophysical potential for registration under clean development mechanism for additional income. There is a need to address the technical, economic, legal and social issues of the adopters because they have to lock their land for long time for CS projects, therefore confidence building measures are essentially required to make them aware/motivate for adoption of trees on their farms for mitigation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and adaptation against changing climate. However, the potential of agroforestry (AF) systems has not been reflected in registration of CS projects due to lack of best practices in AF, procedures and methodologies for carbon accounting, etc., which requires thorough review to develop appropriate models for payments of environmental benefits. Poplar based AF has been considered here as an example to understand the process of accounting CS and its practical applicability for environmental payments.","Population,Natural resource,Livelihood,Land use,Greenhouse gas,Clean Development Mechanism,Carbon project,Carbon accounting,Biology,Agroforestry,Global warming,Environmental science,Effects of global warming,Stock (geology),Soil organic matter,Profitability index,Tillage,Species richness,Soil organic matter,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Revenue,Property rights,Vegetation,Terrestrial ecosystem,Stand development,Terrestrial ecosystem,Greenhouse gas removal,Greenhouse gas,Population,Palatability,Nutritional quality,Setback,Sampling scheme,Reality check,Tropics,Soil carbon,Reforestation,Soil carbon,Psychological resilience,Environmental science","Rajni Sharma,Sanjeev K.

54,Forest Carbon Projects and International Law: A Deep Equity Legal Analysis,2010-01-01,Georgetown International Environmental Law Review,,"Northern citizens, governments, and businesses are investing billions of dollars in the vast, imperiled forests of the South. In a forest carbon project, a developer plants trees to reforest a degraded ecosystem or preserves a forest that would have otherwise been degraded or felled. The developer can then sell the carbon, now sequestered in the trees and underground biomass, for a contracted period of time. Forest carbon projects are legally problematic. In this article, I introduce the elements of forest carbon projects and the legal debates they engender. I introduce the notion of “deep equity,” the concept that provides an aegis for my analysis. I then briefly describe the entwined problems of global climate change and deforestation. I review the legal regime formulated to ameliorate these problems. I explain forest carbon schemes under both international treaties and the voluntary market. I then examine principles of equity, drawn from multilateral environmental agreements, customary international environmental law, and international human rights law obligations that are implicated in forest carbon investments. After introducing each right or principle, I explain how forest carbon projects may or may not advance the right and propose a set of standards for what an ideal project – one that maximizes deep equity – would include. I briefly analyze how international law is currently ill-equipped to regulate these projects, as many of the important actors elude legal control, in part because they are not explicitly named as duty bearers or because neither home nor host countries are able or willing to enforce legal requirements that do exist. I conclude by discussing how international law should be reformed so that forest carbon investments cleave to legal standards that promote genuine adaptation through deep equity, i.e. sustainable individual, community, and ecological health and potential.","International law,International human rights law,Equity (finance),Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Environmental law,Economics,Ecological health,Deforestation,Carbon project,Carbon offset,Sustainability,Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation,Public economics,Economics,Ecology,Democracy,Obstacle,Negotiation,Natural resource,Treaty,The Void,Politics,Transect,Soil carbon,Litter,Pledge,Indonesian,Greenhouse gas","David Takacs,Sanghamitra Mahanty,Helen Suich,Luca Tacconi,David Takacs,Kyla Tienhaara,Anja Eikermann,Andargachew Yirga,Solomon Addisu Legesse,Asnake Mekuriaw,Andri Wibisana",http://www.ielrc.org/content/a1002.pdf,6,carbon project agriculture
55,The [simple carbon project] model v1.0,2019-01-01,Geoscientific Model Development,10.5194/GMD-12-1541-2019,"Abstract. We construct a carbon cycle box model to process observed or inferred geochemical evidence from modern and paleo settings. The [simple carbon project] model v1.0 (SCP-M) combines a modern understanding of the ocean circulation regime with the Earth's carbon cycle. SCP-M estimates the concentrations of a range of elements within the carbon cycle by simulating ocean circulation, biological, chemical, atmospheric and terrestrial carbon cycle processes. The model is capable of reproducing both paleo and modern observations and aligns with CMIP5 model projections. SCP-M's fast run time, simplified layout and matrix structure render it a flexible and easy-to-use tool for paleo and modern carbon cycle simulations. The ease of data integration also enables model–data optimisations. Limitations of the model include the prescription of many fluxes and an ocean-basin-averaged topology, which may not be applicable to more detailed simulations. In this paper we demonstrate SCP-M's application primarily with an analysis of the carbon cycle transition from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the Holocene and also with the modern carbon cycle under the influence of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. We conduct an atmospheric and ocean multi-proxy model–data parameter optimisation for the LGM and late Holocene periods using the growing pool of published paleo atmosphere and ocean data for CO2 , δ13C , Δ14C and the carbonate ion proxy. The results provide strong evidence for an ocean-wide physical mechanism to deliver the LGM-to-Holocene carbon cycle transition. Alongside ancillary changes in ocean temperature, volume, salinity, sea-ice cover and atmospheric radiocarbon production rate, changes in global overturning circulation and, to a lesser extent, Atlantic meridional overturning circulation can drive the observed LGM and late Holocene signals in atmospheric CO2 , δ13C , Δ14C , and the oceanic distribution of δ13C , Δ14C and the carbonate ion proxy. Further work is needed on the analysis and processing of ocean proxy data to improve confidence in these modelling results.","Sea surface temperature,Salinity,Radiocarbon dating,Ocean current,Last Glacial Maximum,Holocene,Computer science,Climatology,Carbon cycle,Atmospheric sciences,Atmosphere,Global climate,Environmental science,Climatology,Sea level,Paleoclimatology,Oceanography,Time series,Threshold limit value,Seasonal cycle,Upwelling,Polar front,Photic zone,Radiocarbon dating,Quaternary,Pleistocene,Oceanography,Environmental science,Biogeochemical cycle,Upwelling,Thermohaline circulation,Shutdown of thermohaline circulation,Standard deviation,Reservoir effect,Mineralogy,Physical geography,Oceanography,Last Glacial Maximum,Solubility pump,Oceanography,Interglacial","Cameron M.

56,"Local vulnerability, Forest communities and Forest- carbon conservation: case of southern Cameroon",2013-01-01,International Journal of Biodiversity and Conservation,10.5897/IJBC2012.0533,"The mechanism for reducing carbon emissions through forest conservation is dominating climate policy processes in many tropical forests countries. However, there are concerns about the implications of these activities on forest-dependent communities, who are vulnerable to climatic stresses. Reconciling local vulnerability, adaptive capacity and forests carbon conservation initiatives is necessary but challenging.  This paper examines this option in two community forests carbon conservation projects in Nomedjoh and Nkolenyeng in southern Cameroon. Base on community perception, the study reveals firstly, that communities are vulnerable to local climate variability and the carbon conservation projects might further exacerbate community vulnerability. Secondly, local adaptation needs and options encompass improvement in livelihood diversification, strengthening the viability of local economic activities, knowledge and capacity building in local agriculture systems and alternative livelihood options. Thirdly, the motivation, incentives and willingness of forest communities to participate in forests conservation activities are somehow influenced by factors linked to their adaptation needs, in addition to the perception of tenure security. Furthermore, the carbon project objectives and activities have prospects to enhance the adaptive capacity of forest communities if well implemented. This study concludes that assessing the vulnerability of livelihood options of communities to both climatic and non climatic stresses is a point of departure to minimise risk on forests carbon conservation schemes.

57,Bioeconomic modelling of woody regrowth carbon offset options in productive grazing systems,2016-01-01,Rangeland Journal,10.1071/RJ15084,"Agricultural land has been identified as a potential source of greenhouse gas emissions offsets through biosequestration in vegetation and soil. In the extensive grazing land of Australia, landholders may participate in the Australian Government’s Emissions Reduction Fund and create offsets by reducing woody vegetation clearing and allowing native woody plant regrowth to grow. This study used bioeconomic modelling to evaluate the trade-offs between an existing central Queensland grazing operation, which has been using repeated tree clearing to maintain pasture growth, and an alternative carbon and grazing enterprise in which tree clearing is reduced and the additional carbon sequestered in trees is sold. The results showed that ceasing clearing in favour of producing offsets produces a higher net present value over 20 years than the existing cattle enterprise at carbon prices, which are close to current (2015) market levels (~$13 t–1 CO2-e). However, by modifying key variables, relative profitability did change. Sensitivity analysis evaluated key variables, which determine the relative profitability of carbon and cattle. In order of importance these were: the carbon price, the gross margin of cattle production, the severity of the tree–grass relationship, the area of regrowth retained, the age of regrowth at the start of the project, and to a lesser extent the cost of carbon project administration, compliance and monitoring. Based on the analysis, retaining regrowth to generate carbon income may be worthwhile for cattle producers in Australia, but careful consideration needs to be given to the opportunity cost of reduced cattle income.","Greenhouse gas,Grazing,Ecology,Climate change mitigation,Clearing,Carbon project,Carbon price,Carbon offset,Biosequestration,Biology,Agroforestry,Water balance,Systems design,Supply chain,Marginal land,Greenhouse gas,Forestry,Woody plant,Woodland,Vegetation,Soil carbon,No-till farming,Greenhouse gas,Soil water,Soil science,Soil carbon,Wool,Profitability index,Livestock,Soil type,Soil science,Soil organic matter,Temperate climate,Sustainability,Methane,Sustainability,Politics,Natural resource,Sustainability,Revenue,Profitability index","Rebecca Gowen,Steven G.

The result reveals that landforms were closely associated with ground CO2 data (R2 = 0.952–0.982) and NDVI. Results from these experiments suggest that the ambient CO2 concentration varies significantly in according to landform and solar intensity forming local vegetation habitat at in situ survey point.

59,Cumulative Carbon Fluxes Due to Selective Logging in Southeast Asia,2014-01-01,Low carbon economy,10.4236/LCE.2014.54018,"Selective logging creates a large amount of wood residues in forests in addition to producing a small amount of sawnwood for use as source of construction materials. Although accounting for carbon fluxes in harvested wood products (HWPs) becomes necessary in the fight against climate change, previous studies focused mainly on carbon fluxes in HWPs in temperate and boreal forests. This report attempts to analyze carbon fluxes in various wood components created by selective logging in production forest in Southeast Asia during a hypothetical period of carbon project implementation between 2015 and 2050 under conventional (CVL) and reduced-impact logging (RIL). Study results suggest that CVL produced about 146.6 (±5.4) million m3 annually. Logging created annual carbon fluxes of about 0.23, 0.23, 0.20, 0.69, and 0.15 MgC ha-1·year-1 in sawnwood, wood wastes at sawmills (SWW), wood product wastes due to logging damages remained in the forests (WPW), branches and top logs (BRA), and belowground dead root (BLD), respectively. Cumulative carbon fluxes were estimated at 281.0, 506.6, and 87.4 TgC year-1 in sawnwood, onsite (WPW, BRA, BLD), and offsite (SWW) pools, respectively. Except in SW, cumulative carbon fluxes in onsite and offsite pools showed a decline trend in about 10 years after logging. Switching from CVL to RIL could increase fluxes in sawnwood 60% higher than that under CVL, while reducing fluxes in short-lived onsite and offsite wood residues. Not only RIL can increase carbon fluxes in sawnwood, it can also increase production of sawnwood and retain more carbon in standing forests.","Waste management,Temperate climate,Taiga,Logging,Greenhouse gas,Forestry,Flux (metallurgy),Environmental science,Climate change,Carbon project,Carbon,Landfill gas utilization,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas accounting,Tropical climate,Sink (computing),Forest inventory,Sink (computing),Plant cover,Land use,Vegetation,Tropics,Tropical deforestation,Tanzania,Sampling (statistics),Forestry,Land use,Global warming,Fossil fuel,Tropical rain forest,Tonne,Satellite observation,Tropical vegetation,Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests,Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests,Sustainable forest management,Silviculture,Secondary forest,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Sustainable development,Sustainability","Vathana Khun,Nophea Sasaki,K.

As such, dozens of projects have been developed to supply carbon offsets to both voluntary and regulated carbon markets. In this paper we shed further light on the effects of such projects on communities and households by studying the implementation of a carbon forestry project in four communities in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. The project pays farmers to carry out a number of tree-planting activities depending on the local agro-ecological systems. We investigate how such activities have been promoted in and adopted by communities and we identify a series of community-based, institutional, resource management and asset-related factors that explain farmers’ willingness to participate in the projects. Our analysis highlights a number of shared motivations for joining the project but varied levels of understanding about the project rationale. We also show how community norms, access to land tenure, financial and physical assets differ among participants and non-participants which translates in increasing inequalities in access to income and to other development projects. However, we also demonstrate that project activities, as currently designed, motivate some farmers to participate because of the potential of the project to act as a mechanism to bridge existing social divides through cooperation in the project and therefore financially and politically benefit from participation. Overall, the paper demonstrates that the project contributes to transforming local livelihoods and institutions, unfortunately not always as originally designed.","Resource management,Payment,Livelihood,Land tenure,Inequality,Forestry,Environmental resource management,Economics,Economic growth,Developing country,Climate change mitigation,Carbon offset,Program Design Language,Payment for ecosystem services,Payment,Willingness to pay,Service provider,Public economics,Typology,Sustainable development,Protected area,Public economics,Property rights,Program Design Language,Silver bullet,Natural resource economics,Livelihood,Payment for ecosystem services,Payment,Opportunity cost,Logging,Greenhouse gas,Forestry,Law and economics,Economics,Sustainable development,Poverty,Political agenda,Silver bullet,Natural resource economics,Financial management","Cary Yungmee Hendrickson,Esteve Corbera,Stefanie Engel,Stefano Pagiola,Sven Wunder,Sven Wunder,William.

64,A Rejoinder to Matthew Paterson and Peter Newell,2012-01-01,Development and Change,10.1111/J.1467-7660.2012.01795.X,"I regret that Paterson and Newell have not been able to benefit more from my review essay. While it may be optimistic to assume that the problem is merely the lack of clarity of my writing, let me try to restate, in different terms, some of the difficulties their book runs up against. As I explained in the essay, Climate Capitalism is based on a fundamental error: the assumption that carbon markets help keep fossil fuels in the ground rather than encourage, even accelerate, their continued exploitation. This error — which is shared by a number of other academic and activist observers — invalidates all of the book’s substantive theses. In particular, the error makes nonsense of the claim that carbon markets can ‘enrol powerful factions of capital in a project of decarbonization’. Carbon markets are not about decarbonization; therefore they cannot enrol any faction of capital in decarbonization. On the contrary, in addition to engendering a welter of other disparate effects, they help the most fossil-dependent parts of the industrial structure avoid decarbonization, while interfering with other measures that would foster it. This error also fatally undermines Paterson and Newell’s claim that carbon markets are capable of mediating a hegemonic ‘coalition’ that could ‘sustain the legitimacy of policies aimed towards . . . “leaving the oil in the soil”’ by bringing together environmentalists and grassroots activists with city traders, financiers, asset managers, carbon project developers, auditors and so on. If carbon markets function in a way that sustains, even deepens, the fossil-fuel economy, then movements working to leave the oil in the soil, as well as others disadvantaged by fossil fuel dependence, are unlikely to be enthusiastic about joining a coalition under their banner. Following the widespread discrediting of carbon markets over the past decade, why do Paterson and Newell believe that they can aid in decarbonization? A survey of their published writings suggests that they rely principally on the following argument:","Regret,Legitimacy,Law and economics,Hegemony,Grassroots,Economics,Disadvantaged,Development economics,Carbon project,Capitalism,CLARITY,Sustainable development,Scarcity,Road pricing,Redistribution of income and wealth,Public economics,Payment for ecosystem services,Profit (economics),Politics,Opposition (planets),Venture capital,Soil carbon,Politics,Public policy,Public economics,Private sector,Sociology,Social science,Neoclassical economics,Sustainable consumption,Natural resource economics,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Shadow price,Present value,Marginal cost,Financial system,Carbon market,Business","Larry Lohmann,Marianne Fay,Stéphane Hallegatte,Kathleen McAfee,Matthew Paterson,Melissa Leach,James Fairhead,James Fraser,Margaret R.

Systems either focus on carbon sequestration or combine sequestration with cash crop cultivation. The latter provide carbon payments with potential income from cash crop sales. Compared with sequestration-only systems those that combine sequestration and cash crop production have higher net benefits, although they are less cost-effective and have less carbon-sequestration potential. Interplanting with faidherbia albidia provides the most attractive balance among competing policy goals.

Developed under the Kyoto Protocol of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the projects aims at restoring heavily degraded sandune affected private lands and contribute to climate change mitigation. The project is expected to sequester 234,584 tons of carbon dioxide (tCO 2 ) in 20 years project cycle with an average annual sequestration of 11,729 (tCO 2 ) per year. The project is expected to have a total carbon stock of 385,253.1 ton Carbon (tC) in the project life span of 20 years as against 7,920.6 (tC) in the baseline scenario. The carbon credits earned from the project is supposed to provide additional incentives to the smallholders who have formed a cooperative society for this purpose. This paper addresses the issues and challenges in developing the project activity and also discusses the lessons learned in the process.

The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) provides a unique setting that allows us to examine the determinants of these two sequential disclosure decisions, first to respond to the CDP questionnaire and second to publish this response. We apply a sequential logit approach to analyze a panel dataset that contains 11,187 firm-year observations across 60 countries from 2006 to 2010. Our results indicate that the determinants of the response decision differ from the determinants of the publication decision. Specifically, the response decision is related to the available financial resources, the existence of a certified environmental management system and the publication of corporate social responsibility reports (preparation costs), whereas the publication decision is associated with the environmental performance and the nature of the competitive environment (proprietary costs). Furthermore, our findings suggest that the voluntary disclosure perspective dominates the legitimacy perspective, explaining the association between environmental performance and the publication decision. However, for carbon-intensive industries, our results indicate that both theoretical perspectives complement each other. Our analysis provides a better understanding of firms’ response and publication decisions.","Voluntary disclosure,Publication,Private information retrieval,Logit,Legitimacy,Key issues,Economics,Corporate social responsibility,Certification,Actuarial science,Accounting,Standard error,Panel data,Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors,Voluntary disclosure,Finance,Factor analysis of information risk,Stakeholder theory,Socially responsible investing,Social science,International Financial Reporting Standards,Incentive,Finance,Voluntary disclosure,Regulation Fair Disclosure,Intermediary,Stakeholder theory,Stakeholder management,Stakeholder analysis,Strategic management,Social responsibility,Social issues,Voluntary disclosure,Private equity firm,Finance,Voluntary disclosure,Sustainability reporting,Social responsibility,The Market for Lemons,Money market,Microeconomics","Christian Ott,Frank Schiemann,Thomas W.

The development of renewable energy in rural areas faces several challenges. Agricultural extension by its nature has an important role in promoting the adoption of new technologies and innovations. Approach: The main focus of this study is to find out the role of extension in adopting solar energy in rural areas by participants in carbon sequestration project. A questionnaire was developed and data was collected from 310 participants in carbon sequestration project. Regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The stepwise method was used in the regression analysis. Results: The result indicates that 30% of the variance in the perception of respondents about role of extension in adopting solar energy could be explained by using educational films and slides, contacting with extension agents, visiting sample sites and providing lectures. Conclusion and Recommendations: The results demonstrated that success of solar energy will depend on the informing population about benefits and in this regard the authorities should provide accurate and on time information. There is no single and appropriate intervention for developing and protecting solar energy in rural areas and in view of the numerous and varied constraints and opportunities, there is need to develop location- specific strategies.","Solar energy,Socioeconomic development,Rural area,Renewable energy,Population,Photovoltaic system,Environmental resource management,Environmental economics,Emerging technologies,Biology,Agronomy,Agricultural extension,Wind power,Rural area,Renewable energy,Tobit model,Tobit analysis,Growing season,Telecommunications,Tape recorder,Solar technology,Waste management,Solar energy,Renewable energy,Rural area,Renewable energy,Leapfrogging,Wind power,Solar energy,Renewable energy,Tv watching,Sri lanka,Socio economic impact,Waste management,Sustainable development,Sustainable design,Utilization,The Internet,Ranking,Total population,Irrigation,Geography","Seyed Jamal F.

Analyzing impact of forest carbon projects on existing governance mechanisms with evidence from India,2020-01-01,Forest Policy and Economics,10.1016/J.FORPOL.2019.102080,"Abstract This research analyses the interactions and impacts of forest carbon projects on existing governance mechanisms viz. policies, institutions and implementation structures. It critically evaluates the assumption that forest carbon projects always result in improved governance of resources. Empirical evidence from a World Bank funded project in the state of Himachal Pradesh in India suggests that these projects might conflict with existing policies and complicate property relations on the ground. These projects might be used by powerful stakeholders as a tool to scuttle the progressive policy reforms. In the case of Himachal Pradesh, state bureaucracy and local elites have used forest carbon project to thwart the progressive policy provisions of HP common land vesting and utilisation (Amendment) Act 2001 and Forest Rights Act 2006, which were enacted to recognise individual and community rights on the community and forest lands respectively. Similarly, existing institutional issues related to lack of inclusiveness, participation and transparency have been exacerbated by the availability of increased resources from the project. Project activities such as fencing and changing land use of community pastures through plantations can adversely impact local livelihoods. Hence, it is imperative to undertake a comprehensive assessment of potential risks and conflicts before implementation of such projects.","Vesting,Transparency (graphic),Livelihood,Land use,Environmental resource management,Environmental planning,Empirical evidence,Economics,Corporate governance,Common land,Carbon project,Stern Review,Stern,Political economy of climate change,Limiting,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Greenhouse gas,Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation,Public policy,Intact forest landscape,Natural resource economics,Livelihood,Global warming,Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation,Land use,Greenhouse gas,Sustainable development,Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation,Policy making,Tourism,Symbolic power,Social science,Politics,Political science,Natural resource management,Vulnerability,Transformational leadership,Subjectivity,Status quo,Socioeconomics,Property rights","Ashish Aggarwal,Nicholas Stern,Ottmar Edenhofer,Ramón Pichs-Madruga,Youba Sokona,Jacob Wesley Phelps,Edward L.

77,An Analysis of Common Forest Management Practices for Carbon Sequestration in South Carolina,2019-01-01,Forests,10.3390/F10110949,"South Carolina (SC) has a variety of different forest types, and they all have potential to sequester a certain amount of carbon. Private forest landowners control a significant portion of the overall forestland in SC, and their management efforts can maintain or improve forest carbon stocks. Currently, the second largest carbon market in the world is the California Carbon Market, which gives a monetary value to sequestered carbon. One carbon credit is equal to one metric ton of carbon and is currently worth around $15.00. Forest management plans are geared toward increasing carbon sequestration over time. This study aims to educate forest landowners about various forest management practices that contribute to increasing carbon stocks by looking at various forest types and locations in SC and their current and projected carbon stocks. Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data were utilized in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to project carbon sequestration for 100 years for 130 plots. A variety of management practices were employed to see the variance in carbon sequestration. Results showed that carbon sequestration would increase for certain management practices such as thinning and prescribed fire. Clear cutting over time was harmful to sequestration. This data will be beneficial for forest landowners interested in a carbon project and those interested in seeing how different management practices affect carbon sequestration.","Thinning,Forest management,Forest inventory,Clearcutting,Carbon sequestration,Carbon project,Carbon credit,Carbon,Biology,Agroforestry,Woodland,Vulnerability,Greening,Reforestation,Forestry,Forest management,Global warming,Forest restoration,Forest ecology,Soil water,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil organic matter,Vegetation,Terrestrial ecosystem,Pinaceae,Natural processes,Global warming,Environmental science,Greenhouse gas,Forest management,Environmental protection,Stock (geology),Land use, land-use change and forestry,Forest inventory,Vegetation,User interface,Stand development,Sustainable forest management,Forest management,Forest inventory","Lucas Clay,Marzieh Motallebi,Bo Song,Craig D.

Several studies reported lack of spatially and temporally consistent databases, need for calibration and validation of models, and development of national frame work to maintain consistency and completeness in efforts and reduction of uncertainty. Considering the need, as part of ISRO Geosphere Biosphere Programme, National Carbon Project (NCP) initiative was taken up to understand and assess land, atmosphere and oceanic components of carbon cycle with a significant scope for integration of remote sensing, geospatial and process based models. The results from the initial studies are discussed in the paper. An increase of the country's forest carbon stocks from 6244.8 to 6621.6 Mt with an annual increment of 37.7 Mt of the carbon from 1995 to 2005 is reported.

We study S&P 500 firms that were surveyed by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and find that firms headquartered in more Democratic states are more likely to disclose carbon emissions information to the CDP. Furthermore, firms in more Democratic states are more likely to permit public disclosure of their survey responses and tend to receive higher disclosure scores. We consider two political variables, one based on political power and one based on public political preference. Our results are consistent with political power driving the firm's willingness to voluntarily disclose information about climate change. These results suggest that the relation between the political environment and disclosure is more closely linked to concerns over regulatory threats as opposed to acquiescence to social norms.","Voluntary disclosure,Social responsibility,Public relations,Public disclosure,Politics,Norm (social),Economics,Democracy,Acquiescence,Voluntary disclosure,Sustainability reporting,Social responsibility,Simultaneous equations,Sander,Public relations,Sustainability,Spillover effect,Social movement,Public relations,Legitimacy theory,Industry classification,Stakeholder,Sociology,Social accounting,Tonne,Natural resource economics,Greenhouse gas,Social responsibility,Politics,Organizational culture,Voluntary disclosure,Shareholder,Profitability index,Sustainability,Stakeholder theory,Secondary sector of the economy,Valuation (finance),Greenhouse gas,Global warming","Scott Hoover,Stephan Fafatas,Peter M.

The purpose of this study was to predict the rural women’ empowerment who received microcredits during the project. The research was done through a descriptive-correlational method. Statistical sample includes 188 rural women who were members of the microcredit Fund. The validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by panel of research committee experts and the reliability was confirmed by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficient to 0.95. The results of study showed that there is positively a significant correlation between rural women empowerment and variables of Membership Years, Loan Amount, and Loan adequacy, Age, Literacy Level and Income per month. But rural women empowerment could be predicted by three variables of Loan adequacy, Literacy Level and women Age. Also, Loan adequacy was known as the most powerful predictor of rural women empowerment. Given the positive impact of microcredits on rural women empowerment, as well as rural women empowerment to reduce pressure on ecosystems and improve carbon sequestration, it is proposed to increase the microcredit program and its amount.","Sustainability,Socioeconomics,Sample (statistics),Natural resource,Loan,Livelihood,Hydrology,Geology,Empowerment,Cronbach's alpha,Carbon sequestration,Rural women,Respondent,Microfinance,Survey methodology,Stratified sampling,Socioeconomics,Women's empowerment,Patriarchy,Microfinance,Social status,Rural women,Regression analysis,Tobit model,Socioeconomics,Socioeconomic status,Socioeconomics,Rural area,Population,Sustainable rural development,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Socioeconomics,Psychology,Poverty,Socioeconomics,Rural area,Response rate (survey),Value chain,Tanzania,Socioeconomics","M.J.

The methods through which primary data were gathered are a triangulation of household survey, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. A total of 132 households were covered by the survey. Findings indicate that though majority of the households resorted to use resources on their own land, the change in the households’ access to the forestland made 24.2% of the sample households to purchase fuel-wood, 39.4 % to purchase fodder and 62.9 % to reduce their livestock possessions. Although some households benefited from the jobs created and the skill trainings given by the initiative, only 22% of the sample household attributed the improvement of their yearly income to the benefits associated with the project. The protection of the forestland came up with negative livelihood outcomes particularly for households which previously highly depended on the forestland and for those living in the close proximity of the protected forest. Finally, among several variables considered, only educational status of the respondents, size of farmland and the distance of the households from the forestland were found to statistically significantly influence the attitude of the respondents towards the forest. Achieving positive livelihood outcome, therefore, requires among others fencing the forest area to reduce human-wildlife conflict; and developing frameworks for access to microcredit services in the study areas.

At the same time, there is a global attempt to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper analyses the medium-term (2015−2020) projections for milk production and associated GHG emissions from dairy cows in Estonia. The FAPRI-GOLD type market model of Estonian agriculture, which is used for projections of agricultural production, was supplemented with a module that helps project GHG emissions. The paper demonstrates the endogenisation of GHG emission factors in a relatively general agricultural market model context. The results imply that increasing milk production by 30% by 2020 would jeopardise Estonia’s commitments with regard to agricultural GHG emissions. However, the average GHG emission per tonne of produced milk will decline, thus reducing the “carbon footprint” of milk production.","Tonne,Milk production,Market model,Greenhouse gas,Carbon footprint,Biology,Agronomy,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural market,Agricultural economics,Runaway climate change,Physical science,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report,Landfill gas utilization,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas accounting,Environmental science,Climatology,Climate change,Supply chain,Scenario analysis,Public debate,Economic policy,Business,Straw,Slurry,Manure management,Waste management,Soil carbon,Manure,Total mixed ration,Ruminant,Livestock,Manure management,Manure,Life-cycle assessment,Milk production,Manure management,Life-cycle assessment","Jelena Ariva,Ants Hannes Viira,Reet Põldaru,Jüri Roots,Jonathan Gregory,Ronald J.

We went ahead to project future GHG emissions up to 2050. Two alternative GHG mitigation scenarios such as moderate (MS) and aggressive (AS) scenarios were developed and examined. Our results showed that total GHG emissions from Nigerian agriculture in 2010 were around 34.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. GHG emissions from livestock accounted for about 69.2 % of the total emissions, making it the largest source of GHG emissions in the sector. Nigeria’s agriculture GHG emissions are expected to increase by 94 % in 2050 relative to 2010 levels. Mitigation strategies in the Nigerian agriculture sector that do not compromise food security are limited. However, with the implementation of different GHG mitigation strategies in the alternative scenarios, emissions are expected to fall by around 13.2 % and 26.7 % by 2050 in the MS and AS, respectively, compared to the baseline scenario. While the mitigation potentials are significant, we argue that robust and dedicated policies are required to accelerate climate-smart agriculture in Nigeria.","Natural resource economics,Livestock,Land use,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas,Food security,Environmental resource management,Enteric fermentation,Carbon dioxide equivalent,Biology,Agriculture,Landfill gas utilization,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas accounting,Operations research,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas,Nitrogen management,Management practices,Environmental resource management,Sustainability,Silage,Livestock,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Water scarcity,Water pumping,Rate of return,Paddy field,Silage,Rumen,Monensin,Straw,Smoke,Residue (complex analysis),Vegetation,Pasture,Greenhouse gas reduction,Water use,Toxicology,Natural resource economics","Michael O.

One of the sectors contributing to the greenhouse gas emissions is the agriculture sector which accounts for 24% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, the effect of cattle husbandry, small ruminant husbandry, poultry husbandry, paddy production, which are the main causes of emissions in the agriculture sector, on agricultural CO2 release was investigated. The research covers the years 1991-2017 of Turkey and China. In the study, time-series analyses such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller Breakpoint Unit Root Test, Johansen Cointegration Test, Ordinary Least Square Regression, Full Modified Ordinary Least Square, Canonical Cointegrating Regression and Impulse-Response Analysis were used. According to the results of the analysis, the effects of cattle husbandry, small ruminant husbandry, and paddy production activities on agricultural CO2 emissions were statistically significant in Turkey. We determined that the most effective variable on agricultural CO2 emissions was cattle husbandry both in the long- and short-term. On the other hand, poultry farming had no statistically significant effect on agricultural CO2 emissions. According to the results of the analysis for China, all variables were statistically significant. As a result, it is important to adopt methods that will not cause environmental damage or will have minimal impact in determination processes of effective parameters on agricultural CO2. The government should determine the boundaries of agricultural production processes through legal arrangements and the relevant ministries should implement them seriously. To take these measures and implement them are seen as a necessity for a sustainable world and a sustainable agricultural sector.","Johansen test,Greenhouse gas,Greenhouse effect,Global warming,Botany,Biology,Animal husbandry,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural policy,Agricultural economics,Payment,Natural resource economics,Multinomial logistic regression,Subsidy,Public expenditure,Farm income,Factors of production,Economics,Agricultural productivity,Per capita,Medicine,Environmental pollution,Urbanization,Terms of trade,Inefficiency,Per capita,Land use,Conservation agriculture,Liberalization,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Sector model,Gross margin,European union,Regression analysis,Public policy,Population,Rural area,Irrigation,Fixed asset","Hasan Gökhan Doğan,Güngör Karakaş,Silvia Coderoni,Roberto Esposti,Rural Affairs,S.

115,Greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions and mitigation options from livestock production in peri-urban agriculture : Beijing – A case study,2017-01-01,Journal of Cleaner Production,10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2017.12.257,"Abstract Livestock production in peri-urban areas constitutes an important sub-sector of the agricultural production system in China, and contributes to environmental degradation and local air borne pollution contributing to smog. As a result, local policies are being implemented to safeguard the environment. However, there has been little attempt to quantify the impact of environmental policies on livestock production structure, spatial distribution and their related greenhouse gases (GHGs) and ammonia (NH 3 ) emissions. Here, we calculated the inventories of GHGs and NH 3 emissions for 2010 and 2014 for peri-urban livestock production in Beijing, using reliable spatially explicit data, which was collected from 1748 industrial farms in 2010 and 2351 industrial farms in 2014, including pig, dairy, beef cattle, poultry and sheep farms. Our estimates indicated that total industrial livestock production increased by 17% between 2010 and 2014, even under the more strict environmental protection polices, with farm size decreasing by between 7% and 47%. Up to 50% of the industrial livestock farms have remained in operation, with the rest closing down or being moved to other regions. Following this trend, total GHGs emission decreased from 5.0 to 4.5 Tg CO 2 -eq between 2010 and 2014. Most of the GHGs emission reduction was due to the lowering of energy related carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission in 2014. Total NH 3 emission decreased from 102 to 96 Gg between 2010 and 2014, mainly due to more stringent environmental regulations for new and extended farms (increased in farm size), e.g. Discharge standard for pollutants for livestock and poultry breeding. Our study identified that GHGs and NH 3 emission hotspots were concentrated in suburban areas (around the city centre and with less agricultural resource and population density) in 2010. However, between 2010 and 2014 these hotspots moved to the exurban plain and mountain area following the closure or sub-division of intensive farms in suburban regions and construction of new and small farms in exurban areas (around the suburban and with more agricultural resource and lower population density). Scenario analysis suggests that total GHGs emission can be reduced by up to 1.0 Tg CO 2 -eq (23% of total livestock sector emissions) in Beijing, using a combination of modifications of farm type, livestock diet and manure management. The integrated scenario can reduce CH 4 , N 2 O and NH 3 emissions by 27%, 9% and 35%, compared to the reference scenario. Within this short period of time (5 years), policies have had direct impacts on peri-urban livestock production in Beijing, resulting in marked changes in the structure of different livestock sectors, as well as the GHGs and NH 3 emission inventories and their spatial distribution. Our analysis clearly shows that the success of these (and future) polices relies on optimizing spatial management of new livestock production systems. Policy and farmer guidance should focus on optimizing livestock diet and on-farm manure management, industrial production systems and the pig and poultry sectors in peri-urban regions.","Peri-urban agriculture,Manure management,Livestock,Industrial production,Greenhouse gas,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Environmental degradation,Economics,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Supply chain,Scenario analysis,Public debate,Urban climate,Sociology,Regional science,Population,Pollution,Natural resource,Opportunity cost,Livestock,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Socioeconomic status,Political science,Development economics,Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics,Manure management,Livestock,Pollutant,Nitrous oxide,Nitrogen,Sustainable management,Opportunity cost,Livestock,Pollution,Nitrous oxide,Nitrogen,Livestock,Life-cycle assessment,Land use, land-use change and forestry","S.

In this framework, production zones are not defined solely in terms of altitude but also in terms of soil, slope, and access to irrigation. A recent option in the irrigated production zone has been greenhouse floriculture, which has become one of the most globally competitive agricultural exports in equatorial mountains. In Ecuador, greenhouse floriculture expanded in the 1990s partly in response to favorable trade agreements but also due to diffusion of technologies from multiple sources and local entrepreneurship.

Impact differences from agricultural inputs, grain farming, and transport processes are estimated. The GWP of a 1 kg loaf of organic wheat bread is about 30 g CO2-eq less than the conventional loaf. When organic wheat is shipped 420 km farther to market, organic and conventional wheat systems have similar impacts. These results can change dramatically depending on soil carbon accumulation and nitrous oxide emissions from the two systems. Key parameters and their variability are discussed to provide producers, wholesale and retail consumers, and policymakers metrics to align their decisions with low-carbon objectives.","Soil carbon,Primary energy,Organic farming,Life-cycle assessment,Greenhouse gas,Global warming,Food miles,Environmental engineering,Economics,Agriculture,Landfill gas utilization,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas accounting,Global warming,Environmental science,Effects of global warming,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Soil fertility,Panicum virgatum,Global warming,Fossil fuel,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Manure management,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Water transport,Transport engineering,Land transport,Soil water,Soil structure,Soil organic matter,Tillage,Soil water,Soil science,Valuation (finance),Sustainability,Operations research","Kyle W Meisterling,Constantine Samaras,Vanessa Schweizer,K.

Currently it is intended to improve environmental benefits by taking advantage of the water, nutrients and gases flows. On the other hand, solid waste (SW) generated by the UA is a new type of waste within cities that has not well been classified or quantified for its use. This could become a new problem for the waste management system within cities in the future, mainly the organic fraction. The objective of this research is to identify what type of i-RTG SW has the potential to be used from a circular economy (CE) perspective and propose a type of management for its material valorization. The results of the case study show that, of the SW generated in i-RTG, the biomass has the greatest potential to be used locally as an eco-material, particularly the tomato stems. Its use is proposed as a substrate for two experimental lettuce crops in i-RTG. The results show that tomato stems have a better yield as a substrate after a prewash treatment, since at first the values of electrical conductivity (EC) are very high with respect to the control substrate, which is expanded perlite. In conclusion, we can say that it is possible to increase the environmental benefits of i-RTG by taking advantage of its biomass locally, helping to foresee a possible future problem regarding the management of the residual biomass of i-RTG within cities. In this way, the paradigm about the perception of the SW of the UA could be changed to give them a by-product treatment from the beginning.","Waste management system,Urban agriculture,Organic fraction,Municipal solid waste,Greenhouse,Environmental engineering,Crop,Circular economy,Chemistry,Biomass,Textile,Processing methods,Polymer chemistry,Waste management,Thermal insulation,Thermal comfort,Sustainable development,Scientific method,Environmental resource management,Urban agriculture,Sustainability,Resource efficiency,Ultimate tensile strength,Saccharum officinarum,Materials science,Waste management,Volatile organic compound,Soil organic matter,Waste management,Volatile organic compound,Population,Wetting,Syntactic foam,Porosity,Surface modification,Silane,Physics,Valuation (finance),Urban agriculture,Stakeholder","Ana Manríquez-Altamirano,Jorge Sierra-Pérez,Pere Muñoz,Xavier Gabarrell,Kestur G.

Robust appraisals of climate impacts at different levels of global-mean temperature increase are vital to guide assessments of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The 2015 Paris Agreement includes a two-headed temperature goal: ""holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C"". Despite the prominence of these two temperature limits, a comprehensive overview of the differences in climate impacts at these levels is still missing. Here we provide an assessment of key impacts of climate change at warming levels of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, including extreme weather events, water availability, agricultural yields, sea-level rise and risk of coral reef loss. Our results reveal substantial differences in impacts between a 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming that are highly relevant for the assessment of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. For heat-related extremes, the additional 0.5 °C increase in global-mean temperature marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions. Similarly, this warming difference is likely to be decisive for the future of tropical coral reefs. In a scenario with an end-of-century warming of 2 °C, virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-induced bleaching from 2050 onwards. This fraction is reduced to about 90 % in 2050 and projected to decline to 70 % by 2100 for a 1.5 °C scenario. Analyses of precipitation-related impacts reveal distinct regional differences and hot-spots of change emerge. Regional reduction in median water availability for the Mediterranean is found to nearly double from 9 % to 17 % between 1.5 °C and 2 °C, and the projected lengthening of regional dry spells increases from 7 to 11 %. Projections for agricultural yields differ between crop types as well as world regions. While some (in particular high-latitude) regions may benefit, tropical regions like West Africa, South-East Asia, as well as Central and northern South America are projected to face substantial local yield reductions, particularly for wheat and maize. Best estimate sea-level rise projections based on two illustrative scenarios indicate a 50 cm rise by 2100 relative to year 2000-levels for a 2 °C scenario, and about 10 cm lower levels for a 1.5 °C scenario. In a 1.5 °C scenario, the rate of sea-level rise in 2100 would be reduced by about 30 % compared to a 2 °C scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of regional differentiation to assess both future climate risks and different vulnerabilities to incremental increases in global-mean temperature. The article provides a consistent and comprehensive assessment of existing projections and a good basis for future work on refining our understanding of the difference between impacts at 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming.","Tropics,Mediterranean climate,Greenland ice sheet,Global warming,Geology,Extreme weather,Coral reef,Climatology,Climate change,Agriculture,Physics,Meteorology,Earth system science,Working group,Political economy of climate change,Extreme events,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Kyoto Protocol,Environmental science,Water cycle,Troposphere,Sensible heat,Meteorology,Greenhouse gas,Global warming,Tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting,Tropical cyclone,Precipitation,Historical record,Global warming,Forcing (mathematics),Vulnerability assessment,Special Report on Emissions Scenarios,Socioeconomic development,Tropics,Representative Concentration Pathways,Food security,Vulnerability,Precipitation,Global risk","Carl-Friedrich Schleussner,Tabea Katharina Lissner,Erich M.

For this purpose, the data were collected from 100 potato farms in Ardabil, Iran. Inquiries were conducted in a face-to-face interviewing November–December 2006 period. Farms were selected based on random sampling method. The results indicated that total energy inputs were 81624.96 MJ ha −1 . About 40% of this was generated by chemical fertilizers, 20% from diesel oil and machinery. About 82% of the total energy inputs used in potato production was indirect (seeds, fertilizers, manure, chemicals, machinery) and 18% was direct (human labor, diesel). Mean potato yield was about 28453.61 kg ha −1 , it obtained under normal conditions on irrigated farming, and taking into account the energy value of the seed, the net energy and energy productivity value was estimated to be 20808.03 MJ ha −1 and 0.35, respectively, and the ratio of energy outputs to energy inputs was found to be 1.25. This indicated an intensive use of inputs in potato production not accompanied by increase in the final product. Cost analysis revealed that total cost of production for one hectare of potato production was 3267.17 $. Benefit–cost ratio was calculated as 1.88.","Waste management,Toxicology,Total cost,Manure,Input–output model,Hectare,Final product,Engineering,Energy consumption,Diesel fuel,Agriculture,Waste management,Input/output,Final product,Waste management,Stratified sampling,Renewable energy,Sowing,Mustard seed,Cultural methods,Waste management,Rainfed agriculture,Kharif crop,Waste management,Sugar beet,Renewable energy,Specific energy,Seedbed,Irrigation,Waste management,Toxicology,Total energy,Waste management,Stratified sampling,Renewable energy,Pepper,Nutrient,Greenhouse,Waste management,Toxicology,Specific energy","Ali Mohammadi,Ahmad Tabatabaeefar,Shahan Shahin,Shahin Rafiee,Alireza Keyhani,Burhan Ozkan,Handan Akcaoz,Cemal Fert,Ibrahim Yilmaz,Handan Akcaoz,Burhan Ozkan,K.G Mandal,K.P Saha,P.K Ghosh,K.M Hati,K.K Bandyopadhyay,H Singh,D Mishra,N.M Nahar,Mohnot Ranjan,Gülistan Erdal,Kemal Esengün,Hilmi Erdal,Orhan Gündüz,M.

The present study illustrates the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use/cover of Hawalbagh block of district Almora, Uttarakhand, India. Landsat satellite imageries of two different time periods, i.e., Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) of 1990 and 2010 were acquired by Global Land Cover Facility Site (GLCF) and earth explorer site and quantify the changes in the Hawalbagh block from 1990 to 2010 over a period of 20 years. Supervised classification methodology has been employed using maximum likelihood technique in ERDAS 9.3 Software. The images of the study area were categorized into five different classes namely vegetation, agriculture, barren, built-up and water body. The results indicate that during the last two decades, vegetation and built-up land have been increased by 3.51% (9.39 km2) and 3.55% (9.48 km2) while agriculture, barren land and water body have decreased by 1.52% (4.06 km2), 5.46% (14.59 km2) and 0.08% (0.22 km2), respectively.

126,Towards an agronomic assessment of N2O emissions: a case study for arable crops,2010-01-01,European Journal of Soil Science,10.1111/J.1365-2389.2009.01217.X,"Agricultural soils are the main anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O), largely because of nitrogen (N) fertilizer use. Commonly, N2O emissions are expressed as a function of N application rate. This suggests that smaller fertilizer applications always lead to smaller N2O emissions. Here we argue that, because of global demand for agricultural products, agronomic conditions should be included when assessing N2O emissions. Expressing N2O emissions in relation to crop productivity (expressed as above-ground N uptake: ‘yield-scaled N2O emissions') can express the N2O efficiency of a cropping system. We show how conventional relationships between N application rate, N uptake and N2O emissions can result in minimal yield-scaled N2O emissions at intermediate fertilizer-N rates. Key findings of a meta-analysis on yield-scaled N2O emissions by non-leguminous annual crops (19 independent studies and 147 data points) revealed that yield-scaled N2O emissions were smallest (8.4 g N2O-N kg-1N uptake) at application rates of approximately 180–190 kg N ha-1 and increased sharply after that (26.8 g N2O-N kg-1 N uptake at 301 kg N ha-1). If the above-ground N surplus was equal to or smaller than zero, yield-scaled N2O emissions remained stable and relatively small. At an N surplus of 90 kg N ha-1 yield-scaled emissions increased threefold. Furthermore, a negative relation between N use efficiency and yield-scaled N2O emissions was found. Therefore, we argue that agricultural management practices to reduce N2O emissions should focus on optimizing fertilizer-N use efficiency under median rates of N input, rather than on minimizing N application rates.","Tillage,Soil water,Nitrous oxide,Greenhouse gas,Fertilizer,Cropping system,Chemistry,Arable land,Agronomy,Agriculture,Runaway climate change,Physical science,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report,Studentization,Statistics,Sampling distribution,Panicum virgatum,Global warming,Fossil fuel,Political economy of climate change,Natural resource economics,Environmental science,Trace gas,Radiative transfer,Radiative forcing,Soil carbon,Radiative forcing,Methane,Nitrogen cycle,Nitrification,Greenhouse gas,Vegetation type,Vegetation,Soil water,Yield gap,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Tonne,Population,Nitrogen fertilizer","J.

Changes in the extent and composition of forests, grasslands, wetlands and other ecosystems have large impacts on the provision of ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation and returns to landowners. While the change in private returns to landowners due to land-use change can often be measured, changes in the supply and value of ecosystem services and the provision of biodiversity conservation have been harder to quantify. In this paper we use a spatially explicit integrated modeling tool (InVEST) to quantify the changes in ecosystem services, habitat for biodiversity, and returns to landowners from land-use change in Minnesota from 1992 to 2001. We evaluate the impact of actual land-use change and a suite of alternative land-use change scenarios. We find a lack of concordance in the ranking of baseline and alternative land-use scenarios in terms of generation of private returns to landowners and net social benefits (private returns plus ecosystem service value). Returns to landowners are highest in a scenario with large-scale agricultural expansion. This scenario, however, generated the lowest net social benefits across all scenarios considered because of large losses in stored carbon and negative impacts on water quality. Further, this scenario resulted in the largest decline in habitat quality for general terrestrial biodiversity and forest songbirds. Our results illustrate the importance of taking ecosystem services into account in land-use and land-management decision-making and linking such decisions to incentives that accurately reflect social returns.","Wetland,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Incentive,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Ecosystem,Economics,Biodiversity,Agriculture,Second-generation biofuels,Low-carbon fuel standard,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Regime shift,Psychological resilience,Habitat fragmentation,Valuation (finance),Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Surface runoff,Nonpoint source pollution,Manure,Woodland,Windbreak,Part iii,Total human ecosystem,Resource management,Natural resource,Strategic planning,Sketch,Natural capital,Welfare,Wage,Valuation (finance),Wildlife crossing,Transportation planning,Sustainable development","Stephen Polasky,Erik Nelson,Derric Pennington,Kris A.

We investigated a successful case of an Austrian farmers' association that set up a community power plant concept and a society for facilitating PV adoption among farmers. We found that PV adoption decisions are driven by economic and environmental considerations and that while ethical considerations are relatively strong among farmers, they cannot be used as predictors in the decision making process. Results furthermore suggest that while adoption of PV increases belief in technological progress as a solution to environmental problems, it may simultaneously lead to a weakening in the belief that underlying lifestyle changes are necessary. Our conclusions address crucial aspects of PV adoption in agriculture, and implications for policy measures related to respective community initiatives.","Technological change,Success factors,Photovoltaics,Making-of,Incentive,Environmental resource management,Economics,Decision-making,Agriculture,Weighting,Social psychology,Social intelligence,Waste management,Input/output,Final product,Royaume uni,Renewable energy,Public economics,Solar power,Solar energy,Postprint,Social psychology,Social heuristics,Social cognitive theory of morality,Self-perception theory,Self-justification,Psychology,Water pumping,Surface water,Site selection,Technical support,Solar power,Social network,Social perception,Political science,Morality,Subsidy,Physics,Photovoltaic system","Thomas Brudermann,Kathrin Reinsberger,Anita Orthofer,Martin Kislinger,Alfred Posch,Gerd Gigerenzer,Wolfgang Gaissmaier,Burhan Ozkan,Handan Akcaoz,Cemal Fert,Gordon P.

This case is discussed in the context of state efforts to shift the region from an agricultural to an industrial to an innovation-driven economy. Central to the transformation of Georgia Tech as a knowledge hub is the emergence of new institutional leadership, programs, organizational forms and boundary-spanning roles that meditate among academic, educational, entrepreneurial, venture capital, industrial, and public spheres. Comparisons between Georgia Tech's experiences and those of university roles in selected other catch-up regions in the southern United States highlight the importance to the case of networked approaches, capacity building, technology-based entrepreneurial development, and local innovation system leadership.

Operational inputs and energy sources for cultivating the field crops and vegetables were determined by a questionnaire applied to 102 farmers from nine villages, which were selected according to their regional properties. Basic operational parameters, such as draft force and power take off torque of agricultural implements, were measured by using a computer based data acquisition system. The highest value of the operational inputs was found to be 17,629.5 MJ ha−1 for tomato cultivation, followed by cotton crop at 14,348.9 MJ ha−1 and, finally, wheat crop at 3735.4 MJ ha−1. In these operational inputs, the highest energy requirements were found for seedbed preparation and irrigation with shares of 13.7–65.1% and 26.3–40.4%, respectively. In the total energy inputs, the maximum energy requirements were determined for cultivating the tomato and cotton crops with values of 45,596.5 MJ ha−1 and 34,891.2 MJ ha−1, respectively. In these energy sources, fertilizer and Diesel inputs contained the highest energy with ranges of 40.1–54.1% and 17.4–43.1%, respectively. The values of specific energy and energy ratio for cultivating wheat, cotton, maize, second crop sesame, tomato, melon and watermelon crops were calculated at 5.24 MJ kg−1 and 2.8, 11.24 MJ kg−1 and 4.8, 3.88 MJ kg−1 and 3.8, 16.21 MJ kg−1 and 1.5, 1.14 MJ kg−1 and 0.7, 0.98 MJ kg−1 and 1.9 and 0.97 MJ kg−1 and 2.0, respectively.","Specific energy,Seedbed,Irrigation,Fertilizer,Engineering,Energy source,Crop,Agronomy,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Sowing,Mustard seed,Cultural methods,Waste management,Rainfed agriculture,Kharif crop,Total energy,Subsistence agriculture,Net energy,Waste management,Tropics,Tractor,Waste management,Tillage,Seedbed,Waste management,Specific energy,Soil type,Traction (orthopedics),Threshing,Tambour,Environmental science,Energy requirement,Agroforestry,Stratified sampling,Statistics,Sampling theory","M.

131,Scenario-based environmental assessment of farming systems: the case of pig production in France,2004-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2004.05.007,"Current intensive pig production is often associated with environmental burdens. However, very few studies deal with the environmental performance of both current and alternative systems of pig production. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the environmental impacts of three contrasting pig production systems using the life cycle assessment method and to identify hot spots for each system. The scenarios compared were conventional good agricultural practice (GAP) according to French production rules, a French quality label scenario called red label (RL) and a French organic scenario called organic agriculture (OA). For each of the three scenarios a “favourable” and an “unfavourable” variant was defined; these variants were used as indicators of uncertainty with respect to key parameters for technical performance and emissions of pollutants. The environmental categories assessed were: eutrophication, climate change, acidification, terrestrial toxicity, energy use, land use and pesticide use. Two functional units (FU) were used to express impacts: 1 kg of pig produced and 1 ha of land surface used. The scenarios were examined with particular emphasis on their contribution to eutrophication and acidification. Given this perspective, the RL scenario can be an interesting alternative to GAP on the condition that its emission of greenhouse gases can be reduced. The results for OA were very dependent on the choice of the FU. Per kg of pig, eutrophication and acidification were similar for OA and GAP, while OA had less eutrophication and acidification than GAP when expressed per ha. For the three scenarios, environmental hot spots and important margins of improvement were identified. Finally, the uncertainty analysis indicated that efforts should be made to produce more reliable estimations of emission factors for NO 3, NH3 and N2O in the field. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Reviews of research findings question the utility of the conceptual and methodological perspectives of prior research. The argument advanced here is that actor-network theory is useful in analyzing conservation agriculture as a radically different agriculture: a new paradigm with new beliefs about soils, plants, the environment, and farmers themselves as well as new crop production systems. The new indigenous cultures of conservation tillage and cropping are innovative products of social networks that join farmland, farmers, farm advisors, and farm supply representatives in new ways. The spread of conservation agriculture has occurred as the result both of new agricultural science of conservation tillage and cropping and the spread of these new networks and their innovative cropping systems.","Socioeconomics,Rural sociology,Economics,Diffusion of innovations,Cropping,Conservation agriculture,Community management,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural education,Agricultural economics,Trend analysis,Socioeconomics,Social theory,Redistribution (cultural anthropology),Political economy,Network approach,Water conservation,Tillage,Surface runoff,World view,Telephone survey,Socioeconomics,Watershed,Water conservation,Structured model,Technoscience,Socioeconomics,Rapeseed,Socioeconomics,Social network,Social constructionism,Socioeconomics,Social change,Rural sociology,Tillage,Mulch-till,Minimum tillage,Socioeconomics,Socialization,Rural area","C.

134,Life cycle assessment of organic versus conventional agriculture. A case study of lettuce cultivation in Greece,2016-01-01,Journal of Cleaner Production,10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2015.09.075,"The environmental sustainability of an organic and a conventional lettuce cultivation system, situated at Northern Greece, was investigated. Data from all stages (i.e. irrigation, machinery used, and fertilizing) of lettuce cultivation were collected and their sustainability was assessed by means of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Two different functional units, namely per hectare of cultivation and per ton of lettuce produced, were used and the environmental impacts, on mid and endpoint level, and CO2 emissions were estimated by means of the SimaPro 8 LCA software. It was found that the environmental footprint and the CO2 emissions were lower by 11% and 15%, respectively, for organic than for the conventional lettuce cultivation, when sustainability was assessed per area (ha) of cultivation. On the contrary, conventional lettuce cultivation showed a better environmental performance than organic by 51% and 53% in terms of CO2 emissions and total environmental impacts, respectively, when the amount of lettuce produced is used as the functional unit of calculations. This is attributed to the fact that the organic system, due to its lower crop yields, requires significantly larger cultivation area to achieve the same crop production with conventional. Moreover, it was found that in all cases the irrigation stage primarily contributed to most impact categories, due to its high energy demands for ground water pumping and the fossil-dependent Greek electricity grid. In addition, in all cases the conventional lettuce cultivation system yielded a significantly high impact onto freshwater eutrophication, due to the use of chemical fertilizers, thus posing serious stresses on local freshwater ecosystems. A sensitivity analysis was carried out and alternative, more sustainable, scenarios were proposed.","Sustainability,Organic farming,Life-cycle assessment,Irrigation,Hectare,Economics,Cultivation System,Crop yield,Agronomy,Agriculture,Soil organic matter,Organic farming,Nutrient management,Total organic carbon,Soil water,Soil management,Waste management,Sustainability,Resource efficiency,Organic farming,Intensive farming,Integrated farming,Life-cycle assessment,Land use,Food security,Waste management,Raw material,Peat,Wet oxidation,Wastewater,Waste management,Waste management,Tyrosol,Polyphenol,Waste management,Truck,Supply chain,Organic farming,Natural resource economics,Natural resource","Spyros Foteinis,Efthalia Chatzisymeon,H.L.

The extent of these impacts depends largely on awareness and the level of adaptation in response to climate change. This study examines the perception of farmers in Sekyedumase district of Ashanti region of Ghana on climate change and analyzes farmers’ adaptation responses to climate change. A hundred and eighty farming households were interviewed in February and October 2009. Results showed that about 92% of the respondents perceived increases in temperature, while 87% perceived decrease in precipitation over the years. The major adaptation strategies identified included crop diversification, planting of short season varieties, change in crops species, and a shift in planting date, among others. Results of logit regression analysis indicated that the access to extension services, credit, soil fertility, and land tenure are the four most important factors that influence farmers’ perception and adaptation. The main barriers included lack of information on adaptation strategies, poverty, and lack of information about weather. Even though the communities are highly aware of climate issues, only 44.4% of farmers have adjusted their farming practices to reduce the impacts of increasing temperature and 40.6% to decreasing precipitation, giving lack of funds as the main barrier to implementing adaptation measure. Implications for policymaking will be to make credit facilities more flexible, to invest in training more extension officers and more education on climate change and adaptation strategies.","Sustainable development,Poverty,Perception,Livelihood,Land tenure,Environmental resource management,Economics,Climate change,Agriculture,Agricultural diversification,Runaway climate change,Physical science,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report,Public administration,Political science,Group ii,Environmental science,Climatology,Tree planting,Soil conservation,Socioeconomics,Subsistence agriculture,Sharecropping,Incentive,Precipitation,Meteorology,Land cover,Socioeconomics,Probit model,Natural resource,Public policy,Micro level,Global environmental analysis,Political economy of climate change,Livelihood,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Spatial variability,Precipitation,North west","B.Y.

Data were collected through a systematic questionnaire survey of 102 households, randomly selected from two peasant associations in the area. Forest income contributed 39% of the average household income, roughly equal to agriculture, which contributed 40%. Forest income was more important than all other income sources combined for the poorest 40% of households and contributed more to household income than agriculture for 65% of households. While forest income represents 59% of the total household income for the poorest quintile, the contribution drops to 34% for the wealthiest quintile. On the other hand, the rich households derive a larger absolute income from forest resources than the poor households. Forest resources have an important income-equalizing potential among the rural households. Reduced access to forest resources would greatly affect the welfare of the rural population and increase wealth differentiation among rural households in the study area.","Welfare,Questionnaire,Peasant,Net national income,Income distribution,Household income,Forest resource,Economics,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Technical change,Structural adjustment,Per capita income,Rural area,Property rights,Forest product,Welfare,Valuation (finance),Socioeconomics,Socioeconomics,Poverty reduction,Poverty,Off-farm income,Natural resource economics,Median income,Subsistence agriculture,Property rights,Population,Typology,Socioeconomics,Social change,Woodland,Valuation (finance),Rural economics,Subsistence economy,Socioeconomics,Poverty,Socioeconomics,Residence,Rainforest","Getachew Mamo,Espen Sjaastad,Pål Vedeld,Arild Angelsen,David Kaimowitz,Bhim Adhikari,Salvatore Di Falco,Jon C.

Because of its rapid growth, the application has received a significant amount of attention. There have been assertions that it can engender transformational benefits by providing the unbanked with new opportunities to access financial services. There is, however, very little discussion of what these transformational benefits are and how they are brought about. This paper will contribute to filling this gap in the literature. It draws on ethnographic fieldwork conducted over fourteen months in two locations – an informal settlement near Nairobi and a farming village in Western Kenya.

It is therefore interesting to know the specific water requirements of various consumer goods, particularly the water-intensive ones. This information is relevant not only for consumers, but also for food processors, retailers, and traders. The objective of this paper is to carry out a pilot study on water footprint accounting and impact assessment for a hypothetical sugar-containing carbonated beverage in a 0.5 l PET-bottle produced in a hypothetical factory that takes its sugar alternatively from sugar beet, sugar cane and high fructose maize syrup and from different countries. The composition of the beverage and the characteristics of the factory are hypothetical but realistic. The data assumed have been inspired by a real case. This paper does not only look at the water footprint of the ingredients of the beverage, but also at the water footprint of the bottle, other packaging materials and construction materials, paper and energy used in the factory. Although most companies focus on their own operational performance, this paper shows that it is important to consider freshwater usage along the supply chain. The water footprint of the beverage studied has a water footprint of 150 to 300 l of water per 0.5 l bottle, of which 99.7–99.8% refers to the supply chain. The study also shows that agricultural ingredients that constitute only a small fraction in weight of the final product have the biggest share at the total water footprint of a product.","Water use,Waste management,Supply chain,Sugar,Impact assessment,Final product,Factory,Economics,Bottle,Agriculture,Accounting,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Water resources,Water use,Water scarcity,Water resource management,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Supply and demand,Water use,Water resources,Virtual water,Water use,Renewable resource,Renewable energy,Water use,Environmental science,Environmental engineering,Water use,Water supply,Water resource management,Water supply,Water resources,Water resource management,Technical progress,Technical change,Sustainable development,Water use,Water resources,Water resource management","A.

In the present study, an entropy-weighted fuzzy water quality index (WQI) has been proposed for performing groundwater quality assessment in and around an industrial park, northwest China, where domestic water requirements are solely met by groundwater. The human health risk was assessed with the model recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, the sources of major ions and main contaminants were also analyzed. The study shows that groundwater in the study area has been contaminated conjunctively by natural processes and industrial and agricultural activities. Nitrate, manganese (Mn), fluoride, total dissolved solids, total hardness and sulfate are major contaminants influencing groundwater quality. Nitrate and heavy metals such as Mn are mainly affected by human agricultural activities and industrial production, while other contaminants are mainly originated from mineral weathering and water–rock interactions. The results of water quality assessment suggest that half of the groundwater samples collected are of medium quality thus require pretreatment before human consumption. The mean health risk caused by the consumption of contaminated groundwater in the area is 8.42 × 10−5 per year which surpasses the maximum acceptable level (5 × 10−5 per year) recommended by the International Commission on Radiologic Protection. The entropy-weighted fuzzy WQI proposed in this study can not only assign proper weights to parameters but also treat uncertainties associated with water quality classification. This study will be of interest to international environmentalists and hydrogeologists. It will also be useful in regional groundwater management and protection.","Water quality,Total dissolved solids,Industrial production,Industrial park,Health risk assessment,Groundwater pollution,Groundwater,Geology,Environmental engineering,Agriculture,Water supply,Water industry,Total suspended solids,Water quality,Water pollution,Sampling (statistics),Water quality,Vagueness,Surface water quality,Organic chemistry,Nanotechnology,Fluorine,Watershed,Spatial ecology,Soil pH,Sodium adsorption ratio,Irrigation,Hydrology,Water resources,Population,Pollution,Water quality,Structural basin,Hydrogeology,Water well,Water table,Water quality,Water well,Water table,Water quality","Peiyue Li,Jianhua Wu,Hui Qian,Xinsheng Lyu,A.E.

China has implemented ‘Grain for Green’ (GFG) project to restore the eco-environment of the Loess Plateau since 1999. With the GFG project subsidy approaching the end, it is concerned that farmers of fewer subsidies may reclaim land again. Thus, ‘Gully Land Consolidation Project’ (GLCP) was initiated in 2010. The core of the GLCP was to create more land suitable for farming in gullies so as to reduce land reclamation on the slopes which are ecological vulnerable areas. This paper aims to assess the effect of the GLCP on soil erosion problems by studying Wangjiagou project region located in the central part of Anzi valley in the middle of the Loess Plateau, mainly using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) based on GIS. The findings show that the GLCP can help to reduce soil shipment by 9.87% and it creates more terraces and river-nearby land suitable for farming which account for 27.41% of the whole study area. Thus, it is feasible to implement the GLCP in places below gradient 15°, though the GLCP also intensifies soil erosion in certain places such as field ridge, village land, floodplain, natural grassland, and shrub land. In short, the GLCP develops new generation dam land and balances the short-term and long-term interests to ease the conflicts between economic development and environmental protection. Furthermore, the GLCP and the GFG could also be combined preferably. On the one hand, the GFG improves the ecological environment, which could offer certain safety to the GLCP, on the other hand, the GLCP creates more farmland favorable for farming in gullies instead of land reclamation on the slopes, which could indirectly protect the GFG project.","Universal Soil Loss Equation,Subsidy,Land reclamation,Land consolidation,Hydrology,Grassland,Geology,Floodplain,Erosion,Agriculture,WEPP,Universal Soil Loss Equation,Surface runoff,Urbanization,Requisition,Policy making,WEPP,Universal Soil Loss Equation,Soil type,Technical support,Subsidy,Public policy,Rural poverty,Rural area,Poverty,Remote sensing,Environmental studies,Environmental science,Universal Soil Loss Equation,Surface runoff,Soil water,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil organic matter,Soil functions,Plateau,Loess,Land use,Watershed,Universal Soil Loss Equation,Precipitation","Yansui Liu,Yanjun Guo,Yurui Li,Yuheng Li,K.

This paper explores the usefulness of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in identifying environmental improvement opportunities in horticultural systems. LCA has been applied to three commercial apple (Malus x domestica, Borkh.) orchards and two reference orchards, representing standard practices according to expert advice, in New Zealand. Variability observed in the results suggests growers’ technique exerts considerable impact on the LCA results, introducing variances of 30–50% in energy consumption and other environmental impacts when performing the same field operation. Despite a small sample size, the origins of the environmental impacts resulting from these examples of Integrated Fruit Production (IFP) were observed to be generally similar. Human toxicity related impacts were dominated by emissions of the synthetic pesticides used in IFP, and were thoroughly modelled in the study. The production of pesticides and agricultural machinery was found to be significant in the overall energy consumption of the orchard; pesticide production represented 10–20% of energy consumption, while machinery production accounted for 7–12% of energy consumption in all study sites. The application of LCA helped to identify improvement opportunities to reduce environmental impacts within this and related production systems, and demonstrated its usefulness in setting priorities to realise these opportunities. LCA is a holistic approach that measures the different environmental impacts from agriculture and is useful for the development of certification schemes such as EUREP GAP, or the assessment of the environmental soundness of agricultural technologies.","Life-cycle assessment,Integrated farming,Environmental planning,Environmental impact assessment,Energy consumption,Ecology,Certification,Biology,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural machinery,Life-cycle assessment,Life cycle thinking,Life cycle inventory,Life-cycle assessment,Iso standards,Environmental science,Life-cycle assessment,Inventory analysis,Impact assessment,Waste management,Urban bus,Raw material,Rye bread,Reliability engineering,Mean value,Life-cycle assessment,Environmental science,Environmental planning,Western europe,Life cycle inventory,Forestry,Life-cycle assessment,Environmental resource management,Environmental planning,System integration,Soil compaction,Resource depletion,Waste treatment,Waste management,Good practice","L.

North China is a region that is facing severe water scarcity problems. In order to provide appropriate water mitigation policies a regional study is completed. Under this circumstance, Liaoning Province, a typical heavy industrial province in north China is chosen as a case study region. The input–output analysis method is employed in order to evaluate the water footprint both from production and consumption perspectives. The results show that the total water footprint of Liaoning in 2007 was 7.30 billion m 3 , a 84.6% of internal water footprint and a 15.4% external water footprint. The water trade balance of Liaoning was 2.68 billion m 3 , indicating that Liaoning was a net water export region, although water shortages are becoming a more serious concern. The “Agriculture” and “Food and beverage production” sectors are found to have the highest water footprint, water intensity, water exports, and water trade balance. Based upon Liaoning realities policy implications and suggestions are made, including industrial and trade structure adjustment, application of water efficient technology and management measures, and appropriate capacity-building efforts. The methodology and findings may be useful for investigation of water footprints throughout various regions of the world.","Water use,Water trading,Water scarcity,Water conservation,Input–output model,Environmental protection,Environmental impact of the energy industry,Environmental engineering,Chemistry,Balance of trade,Agriculture,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Water resources,Per capita,Greenhouse gas,Greenhouse,Virtual water,Natural resource economics,Environmental science,Water use,Water scarcity,Water resources,Water use,Water resources,Virtual water,Subsistence agriculture,Recreation,Quarter (United States coin),Water use,Environmental science,Environmental engineering,Water use,Water supply,Water resources,Water supply,Water scarcity,Water demand,Sustainable consumption,Input–output model,Footprint","Huijuan Dong,Yong Geng,Joseph Sarkis,Tsuyoshi Fujita,Tomohiro Okadera,Bing Xue,A.

Proponents of SRI have reported that the average rice yield with SRI is double the current average yield and can be increased to the level of three to four times. Opponents say the reported high yields are due to measurement error and that usual information expected in support of these fantastic yields is missing. The number of SRI adopters has increased in India in recent years. We evaluate the impact of adoption of SRI practices on rice yields, the economics of paddy cultivation and labour inputs based on field research conducted in Purulia, West Bengal, India. Paddy yields with SRI were higher than those under conventional paddy cultivation by 32% and net returns were higher by 67%. Labour input was reduced by 8%. SRI adoption enabled farmers consistently to enhance paddy yields, increase returns and save labour; and enhance productivity with respect to the key inputs in terms of paddy output per unit of seed, fertilizer and labour-day. SRI promises to be a significant alternative for not only raising paddy yields, but also for managing paddy based farming in resource-starved regions.","Weed control,Tropics,System of Rice Intensification,Soil management,Fertilizer,Economics,Cultural practice,Cropping system,Agronomy,Agriculture,Agricultural science,System of Rice Intensification,Resource poor,Irrigation,System of Rice Intensification,Sustainable agriculture,Rural area,System of Rice Intensification,Soil fertility,Oryza sativa,System of Rice Intensification,Natural resource,Management system,System of Rice Intensification,Sri lanka,Odds,Water resources,Paddy field,Natural resource economics,Weed control,System of Rice Intensification,Seedbed,Social science,Botany,Biology,Third world,System of Rice Intensification,Oryza sativa,Nonsense,Classics,Botany","Shekhar Kumar Sinha,Jayesh Talati,Willem A.

GIs are place-based names (e.g., Champagne, Roquefort) that convey the geographical origin, as well as the cultural and historical identity, of agricultural products. The GI for tequila was established by the Mexican government in 1974, making it the oldest GI, and one of the best-recognized, outside of Europe. Here, we examine the social, economic, and ecological impacts that the agave–tequila industry has had on one community in tequila's region of origin, the town of Amatitan. We show that persistent cycles of surplus and shortage of agave and changing production relations in the agave–tequila industry have led to: (1) economic insecurity among farm households; (2) increased use of chemical inputs, at the expense of more labor-intensive cultivation practices; and (3) overall declines in fertilizer application, especially during periods in which there is a surplus of agave. We argue that the negative effects of the agave–tequila industry on the local economy and environment are due to the failure of the GI for tequila to value the ways in which the terroir of tequila's region of origin have contributed to its specific properties. We conclude by using this case to discuss more generally the relationship between the protection of place-based products (known collectively as geographical indications) and social and environmental sustainability.","Terroir,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Socioeconomics,Natural resource economics,Economics,Economic impact analysis,Beverage industry,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural economics,Agave,Social science,Short food supply chains,Rural development,Sociology,Social science,Rural sociology,Typology,Three level,Supply chain,Supply chain,Short food supply chains,Neoclassical economics,Terroir,Sociology,Scrutiny,Western europe,Sociology,Social science,Trade barrier,Sustainability,Organic movement,Wine tasting,Wine,Terroir,Typology,Sociology,Social science,Stylized fact,Liberalization,Legislation","Sarah Bowen,Ana Valenzuela Zapata,Henk Renting,Terry K Marsden,Jo Banks,Jan Douwe Van Der Ploeg,Henk Renting,Gianluca Brunori,Karlheinz Knickel,Joe Mannion,Terry Marsden,Jo Banks,Gillian Bristow,Jonathan Murdoch,Terry Marsden,Jo Ann Banks,Elizabeth Barham,David Goodman,Laura T.

However, its future as a strategic commodity in Mediterranean agriculture is threatened by diverse biotic (traditional and new/emerging pests and diseases) and abiotic (erosion, climate change) menaces. These problems could also be of relevance for new geographical areas where olive cultivation is not traditional but is increasingly spreading (i.e., South America, Australia, etc). One of the major constraints for olive cultivation is Verticillium wilt, a vascular disease caused by the soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae Kleb. In this review we describe how Verticillium wilt of olive (VWO) has become a major problem for olive cultivation during the last two decades. Similar to other vascular diseases, VWO is difficult to manage and single control measure are mostly ineffective. Therefore, an integrated disease management strategy that fits modern sustainable agriculture criteria must be implemented. Multidisciplinary research efforts and advances to understand this pathosystem and to develop appropriate control measures are summarized. The main conclusion is that a holistic approach is the best strategy to effectively control VWO, integrating biological, chemical, physical, and cultural approaches.","Verticillium wilt,Verticillium dahliae,Threatened species,Sustainable agriculture,Soil solarization,Pathosystem,Integrated pest management,Botany,Biology,Agriculture,Tree rearrangement,T-REX,Split networks,Trichoderma harzianum,Trichoderma,Systemic acquired resistance,Mutualism (biology),Life history theory,Epichloë,Soil microbiology,Pseudomonas protegens,Pseudomonas chlororaphis,Standard curve,SYBR Green I,Replicate,Trichoderma,Spore,Mycelium,Quantitative genetics,Population genetics,Population,Trichoderma,Siderophore,Postharvest,Rhizosphere,Rhizobacteria,Phyllosphere,Rhizosphere,Population,Phyllosphere","Francisco Javier López-Escudero,Jesús Mercado-Blanco,Naruya Saitou,Masatoshi Nei,Gary E.

154,"Farmers' perceptions of and adaptation strategies to climate change and their determinants: the case of Punjab province, Pakistan",2014-01-01,Earth System Dynamics Discussions,10.5194/ESD-6-225-2015,"Abstract. Climate change is a global environmental threat to all economic sectors, particularly the agricultural sector. Pakistan is one of the countries negatively affected by climate change due to its high exposure to extreme events and low adaptive capacity. In Pakistan, farmers are the primary stakeholders in agriculture and are more at risk due to climate vulnerability. Based on farm household data from 450 households collected from three districts in three agroecological zones in the Punjab province of Pakistan, this study examines how farmers perceive climate change and how they adapt their farming in response to perceived changes in climate. The results demonstrate that awareness of climate change is widespread throughout the area, and farm households make adjustments to adapt their agriculture in response to climatic change. Overall 58% of the farm households adapted their farming to climate change. Changing crop varieties, changing planting dates, planting of shade trees and changing fertilizers were the main adaptation methods implemented by farm households in the study area. The results from the binary logistic model reveal that education, farm experience, household size, land area, tenancy status, ownership of a tube well, access to market information, information on weather forecasting and agricultural extension services all influence farmers' choices of adaptation measures. The results also indicate that adaptation to climate change is constrained by several factors such as lack of information, lack of money, resource constraints and shortage of irrigation water in the study area. Findings of the study suggest the need for greater investment in farmer education and improved institutional setup for climate change adaptation to improve farmers' wellbeing.","Vulnerability,Geology,Environmental resource management,Economic sector,Climatology,Climate change,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural extension,Agricultural economics,Agricultural diversification,Adaptive capacity,Unit-weighted regression,Statistics,Regression analysis,Working group,Vulnerability,Sustainability and systemic change resistance,Vulnerability,Social psychology (sociology),Psychological resilience,Tree planting,Soil conservation,Socioeconomics,Specification,Sorghum,Panel analysis,Subsistence agriculture,Sharecropping,Incentive,Statistics,Research methodology,Regression diagnostic,Vulnerability,Risk perception,Perception,Public policy,Political economy of climate change,Multiple cropping,Public policy,Micro level,Global environmental analysis","Mohammad Abid,Jürgen Scheffran,U.

Distributed systems are typically privately owned and managed by individuals or groups, in contrast to centralized irrigation systems, which tend to be publicly operated and involve large water extractions and distribution over significant distances for use by scores of farmers. Here we draw on a growing body of evidence on smallholder farmers, distributed irrigation systems, and land and water resource availability across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to show how investments in distributed smallholder irrigation technologies might be used to (i) use the water sources of SSA more productively, (ii) improve nutritional outcomes and rural development throughout SSA, and (iii) narrow the income disparities that permit widespread hunger to persist despite aggregate economic advancement.","Water supply,Water resource management,Water conservation,Irrigation management,Irrigation,Human power,Geography,Food security,Deficit irrigation,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,South asia,Natural resource economics,Malnutrition,Growing season,Geography,Food prices,Water table,Water storage,Water resources,Tropics,Temperate climate,Subtropics,Water storage,Water security,Water resources,Wetland,Soil water,Soil salinity,Water conservation,User group,Public policy,Population,Livelihood,Household income,Water conservation,Sustainability,Rural area,Sub saharan,Participatory management,Natural resource economics","Jennifer A.

There is therefore a need for researchers to design tools to guide public decision-making on land use. Various approaches, originating from different disciplines, may be adopted in this respect. We designed an interdisciplinary research program in order to test two related concepts: the ""sustainability"" and the ""multi-functionality"" of agriculture. We show that these concepts provide a useful framework for obtaining appropriate knowledge about urban agriculture, which urban planners could apply in real situations. In close collaboration with urban planners, we applied an interdisciplinary research methodology, based on common farm surveys and territorial approaches, to the Antananarivo area (Madagascar). The main functions analyzed were the food production and environmental roles of urban agriculture. Two aspects of sustainability were assessed: the farm sustainability and the territorial sustainability, with expert scores. This approach identified a wide diversity of farming systems that performed differently, depending on their intra- or suburban location. The food supply function appeared to be important not only for fresh produce but also for rice consumption. The function of protection against flooding is now important and this importance will increase with climate change. A diagnosis of sustainability was made and discussed with urban planners: several farming systems and zones were identified in which agriculture was considered important as a means of maintaining or developing the food supply, employment and incomes, and even landscape or environmental quality. We also identified other areas in which poor production conditions and/or the negative effects of urbanization on agriculture jeopardized its sustainability. This methodology appeared to be useful for determining the most appropriate role of urban agriculture in the land-use planning of this city. Our study raises new questions on the subject and should lead to more focused research programmes. We discuss several points of interest and the limitations and possible extension of this method.","Urbanization,Urban planning,Urban density,Urban agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Land use,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Economics,Agriculture,Urbanization,Urban agriculture,Poverty,Urban agriculture,Urban agglomeration,Peri-urban agriculture,Urban planning,Urban density,Urban agriculture,Research needs,Priority areas,Poverty reduction,Water resources,Peri-urban agriculture,Land use,Urban planning,Urban ecosystem,Urban agriculture,Urban poor,Urban planning,Urban density,Sustainability,Productivism,Natural resource economics,Sustainable development,Profit (economics),Interdependence,Urban planning,Urban geography,Urban ecosystem","Christine Aubry,Josélyne Ramamonjisoa,Marie-Hélène Dabat,Jacqueline Rakotoarisoa,Josette Rakotondraibe,R.

The overall objective of this study was to understand local communities’ perceptions on climate and variability issues and establish its impacts and adaptation strategies within agricultural sector. Both secondary and primary were used. Primary data were obtained using different Participatory Research Approaches (PRA) including, focus group discussions and household questionnaires. In each village, a sample size of 10% of all households was interviewed. Findings showed that local people perceived changes in rainfall and temperature. The changes have affected crops and livestock in a number of ways resulting in reduced productivity. Empirical analysis of rainfall suggest decreasing rainfall trend between 1922 and 2007 whereas mean maximum and minimum temperature increased by 1.9 and 0.2°C respectively. The average annual temperature increase of 0.7°C between 1984 and 2004 was realized. There are different wealth groups namely the rich, the middle and the poor and these are differently vulnerable climate change. The study concluded that, the wealth of knowledge on coping and adaptation that farmer has should form a foundation for designing agricultural innovation systems to deal with impacts of climate change and variability. Further, development initiatives at community level in semi arid areas should put more emphasis on water harvesting to ensure water storage for crops and livestock.

The scale of the plant should be adapted to the potential, regional, raw-material supply, but still be large enough to give economies of scale. The integration with heat sinks proved to be most important to achieve high energy-efficiency, but it was of somewhat less importance for the profitability. Development of pentose fermentation, leading to higher ethanol yields, was important to gain high profitability. Promising locations were identified in the county of Ostergotland where integration with an existing 1st generation ethanol plant and district heating systems (DHSs) is possible, and in the county of Skane where both a significant, potential straw supply and integration potential with DHSs are available.","Waste management,Straw,Raw material,Profitability index,Ethanol fuel,Engineering,Economies of scale,Biorefinery,Biogas,Agriculture","Anna Ekman,Ola Wallberg,Elisabeth Joelsson,Pål Börjesson",https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:appene:v:102:y:2013:i:c:p:299-308,104,agriculture case study greenhouse gas
159,The role of agricultural credit in the growth of livestock sector: a case study of Faisalabad.,2008-01-01,Pakistan Veterinary Journal,,"This study employed stratified random sampling approach to collect the input-output and socioeconomic data set to see the impact of credit on the growth of livestock sector in the rural areas. The income elasticities of meat and livestock products were highest compared to all other food items except fruits, defining the future role of livestock sector in our food basket. It was observed that credit availability expanded the livestock sector more than double (economies of size), which increased per family per month income from livestock sector by 181%. The elasticity values of family size, literacy rate (schooling years) and credit were 0.18, 0.05 and 0.06, respectively. The elasticity of family size was highest, followed by credit and literacy rate, indicating that adequate potential exists that can be explored to utilize unemployed and untrained rural labor in the agriculture sector. It would help to mitigate the increasing population pressure on mega cities of Pakistan by providing employment opportunities at the door steps of rural community.","Stratified sampling,Socioeconomic status,Rural community,Rural area,Megacity,Livestock,Credit availability,Biology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Project commissioning,Library science,Engineering,Technological change,Information flow (information theory),Developing country,Resource allocation,Linear programming,Economics,Subsidy,Rural economics,Rural area,Economics,Economic growth,Development economics","Abedullah,N.

The decision to engage in production post decoupling is simulated using profit maximising multi-period linear programming models. The number of farmers that would financially benefit from disengaging from production is projected. The results of the economic models suggest that significant restructuring is likely to occur at the farm level as a result of decoupling. Projections of farmers’ production decisions post decoupling are compared and contrasted to the results of a survey of farmers’ production intentions. The comparison shows that despite the significant changes in profitability that decoupling could engender, the majority of farmers intend to continue as before and are unlikely to change their production patterns. The survey of farmers’ intentions indicates that a large number of farmers still seem to consider the decoupled payment linked to production. The implications of these results for land use, agricultural production and farm numbers are discussed.","Restructuring,Profitability index,Payment,Economics,Economic model,Decoupling (cosmology),Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural policy,Agricultural economics,Single Farm Payment,Scrutiny,Profitability index,Supply chain management,Supplier relationship management,Purchasing,Transfer payments multiplier,Probit model,Payment,Scrutiny,Public economics,Peace Clause,Trade barrier,International trade,Free trade,Risk effect,Negotiation,Natural resource economics,Revenue,Restructuring,Price support,Risk aversion,Land use,Intensive farming,The Republic,Profitability index,Mixed farming,Regional science,Economics,Common Agricultural Policy","James P.

162,Review: The impact of agricultural activities on water quality: A case for collaborative catchment-scale management using integrated wireless sensor networks,2013-01-01,Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,10.1016/J.COMPAG.2013.05.001,"The challenge of improving water quality is a growing global concern, typified by the European Commission Water Framework Directive and the United States Clean Water Act. The main drivers of poor water quality are economics, poor water management, agricultural practices and urban development. This paper reviews the extensive role of non-point sources, in particular the outdated agricultural practices, with respect to nutrient and contaminant contributions. Water quality monitoring (WQM) is currently undertaken through a number of data acquisition methods from grab sampling to satellite based remote sensing of water bodies. Based on the surveyed sampling methods and their numerous limitations, it is proposed that wireless sensor networks (WSNs), despite their own limitations, are still very attractive and effective for real-time spatio-temporal data collection for WQM applications. WSNs have been employed for WQM of surface and ground water and catchments, and have been fundamental in advancing the knowledge of contaminants trends through their high resolution observations. However, these applications have yet to explore the implementation and impact of this technology for management and control decisions, to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder's contributions, in an autonomous and dynamic manner. Here, the potential of WSN-controlled agricultural activities and different environmental compartments for integrated water quality management is presented and limitations of WSN in agriculture and WQM are identified. Finally, a case for collaborative networks at catchment scale is proposed for enabling cooperation among individually networked activities/stakeholders (farming activities, water bodies) for integrated water quality monitoring, control and management.","Wireless sensor network,Water quality,Water Framework Directive,Urban planning,Stakeholder,Environmental resource management,Engineering,Data collection,Clean Water Act,Agriculture","Huma Zia,Nick R.

Simple random sampling technique was used to select six villages from the LGA and 60 women farmers. Interview scheduled was used to obtain information from the women, on their socio-economic characteristics, farm activities, farm production and their constraints. Descriptive statistics was used to analyzed the data collected. The result revealed that 88% of the respondents age were within 20-49 years, 12% were 50-70 years of age; 80% were married including widows and divorces, 20% single; 75% had formal education, 25% had no formal education; 35% had 1-10 years farming experience, while 65% had 11-40 years. Majority (72%) of the respondents were small-scale farmers having 0.1-3.0 hectares of farmland for cultivation of food crops. Majority of the women acquired land for farming from their husbands and relations (freehold), while others hired land for farming. The respondents sources of income for farming were through cooperative society (33%) and previous farm out put (23%) only few (13%) were able to secure Bank loan, while others borrowed money from friends. The result also showed that women were involved in all farm activities from land clearing to harvesting, processing and marketing of produce. They plant different crops, rear animals and keep poultry. The women farmers’ constraints include mainly lack of land for farming, credit facilities, costly and late input delivery. Women farmers have contributed immensely, to food production, processing and preservation of foods. Serious attention should be paid to their constraints because women are the backbone of agricultural development and food security in Nigeria.","Socioeconomics,Local government area,Loan,Hectare,Freehold,Food security,Food science,Food processing,Descriptive statistics,Chemistry,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Good agricultural practice,Economics,Economic growth,Developing country,Business,Agricultural extension,Geography,Economic growth,Agriculture,Land tenure,Business,Agricultural economics","E F Fabiyi,B B Danladi,K E Akande,Katrine Anderson Saito,Daphne Spurling,M.

164,A soil change-based methodology for the quantification and valuation of ecosystem services from agro-ecosystems: A case study of pastoral agriculture in New Zealand,2014-01-01,Ecological Economics,10.1016/J.ECOLECON.2014.02.008,"This paper tests the steps required to transform a theoretical natural capital/ecosystem service framework for soils into an operational model. Each of the services provided by a volcanic soil under a pastoral dairy use are quantified and valued. The six guiding principles underpinning the method developed include differentiating soil services from supporting processes; identifying key soil properties and processes behind each service; distinguishing natural capital from added/built capital; identifying how external drivers affect natural capital stocks; analysing the impact of degradation processes on soil properties and basing the economic valuation on measured proxies. Proxies to quantify ecosystem services focus on the part played by soil in generating each service. This new approach highlights the importance of soil change in quantifying services, and goes beyond simply determining the status of soil natural capital. The total value of the ecosystem services provided by a volcanic soil under dairy in the Waikato region in New Zealand was estimated at $16,390/ha/year on average over 35 consecutive years. The services with the highest value were the filtering of nutrients and contaminants (58–63% of total value), followed by the provision of food and then flood mitigation. Regulating services had an economic value 2.5 times more important than provisioning services.","Valuation (finance),Soil health,Natural capital,Flood mitigation,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem valuation,Ecosystem services,Ecosystem,Economics,Agriculture,Landfill gas utilization,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas accounting,Planetary boundaries,Humanity,Fresh water,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Valuation (finance),Typology,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Welfare,Performance measurement,National accounts,Typology,Resource management,Natural resource management,Total human ecosystem,Sustainable development,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Value engineering,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Water security,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Total human ecosystem,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil management","E.

In this paper, water footprints were calculated for two complex agrifood products, 250 g Peanut M&M's ® and 575 g Dolmio ® pasta sauce, in order to evaluate the usefulness of the concept when applied at the product brand level. The process LCA-based methodology took account of blue water appropriated from surface and groundwater resources, green water appropriated from the root zone by plants, and dilution water, being the volume of freshwater needed to assimilate emissions to freshwater. These case studies revealed several issues, namely the lack of correspondence between water footprints and the availability of water for alternative uses in the absence of production, and the difficulty in relating water footprints to potential social and environmental harm. As such, the water footprinting concept requires further development to be useful for promoting sustainable production and consumption.","Water use,Water resource management,Water conservation,Virtual water,Sustainability,Surface water,Life-cycle assessment,Groundwater,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Economics,Agriculture,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Water resources,Water use,Water resources,Water resource management,Water use,Water supply,Water storage,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Water resources,Life-cycle assessment,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Water use,Water resource management,Water conservation,Water supply,Water resource management,Water consumption,Waterlogging (agriculture),Water resources,Water quality,Virtual water,Nexus (standard),Metaphor,Supply chain,Retail sector,Marketing","B.G.

167,"Does land fragmentation affect farm performance? A case study from Brittany, France",2014-01-01,Agricultural Systems,10.1016/J.AGSY.2014.05.005,"Agricultural land fragmentation is widespread and may affect farmers’ decisions and impact farm performance, either negatively or positively. We investigated this impact for the western region of Brittany, France, in 2007. To do so, we regressed a set of performance indicators on a set of fragmentation descriptors. The performance indicators (production costs, yields, revenue, profitability, technical and scale efficiency) were calculated at the farm level using Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data, while the fragmentation descriptors were calculated at the municipality level using data from the cartographic field pattern registry (RPG). The various fragmentation descriptors enabled us to account for not only the traditional number and average size of plots, but also their geographical scattering. We found that farms experienced higher costs of production, lower crop yields and lower profitability where land fragmentation (LF) was more pronounced. Total technical efficiency was not found to be significantly related to any of the municipality LF descriptors used, while scale efficiency was lower where the average distance to the nearest neighbouring plot was greater. Pure technical efficiency was found to be negatively related to the average number of plots in the municipality, with the unexpected result that it was also positively related to the average distance to the nearest neighbouring plot. By simulating the impact of hypothetical consolidation programmes on average pre-tax profits and wheat yield, we also showed that the marginal benefits of reducing fragmentation may differ with respect to the improved LF dimension and the performance indicator considered. Our analysis therefore shows that the measures of land fragmentation usually used in the literature do not reveal the full set of significant relationships with farm performance and that, in particular, measures accounting for distance should be considered more systematically.","Statistics,Revenue,Profitability index,Profit (economics),Performance indicator,Fragmentation (computing),Economics,Ecology,Crop yield,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural land,X-inefficiency,Truncated regression model,Programming paradigm,Resource productivity,Porter hypothesis,Pollution prevention,Terminology,Productivity,Natural resource economics,Resizing,Empirical research,Economics,Survey data collection,Physical capital,Livestock,Profit efficiency,Land use,Land tenure,Returns to scale,Land policy,Land fragmentation,Opportunity cost,Microeconomics,Land consolidation,South east,Land fragmentation,Inefficiency,Panel data,Monetary value,Land use","Laure Latruffe,Laurent Piet,A A Charnes,W W Cooper,E Rhodes,Michael E.

The crop model AquaCrop-OS (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) was modified to run on a 2° × 2° grid and coupled to 122 climate model projections from multi-model ensembles for three emission scenarios (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 [CMIP3] SRES A1B and CMIP5 Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] scenarios 4.5 and 8.5) as well as two “within-model” ensembles (NCAR CCSM3 and ECHAM5/MPI-OM) designed to capture internal variability (i.e., uncertainty due to chaos in the climate system). In spite of high uncertainty, most notably in the high-producing semi-arid zones, we observed robust regional and sub-regional trends across all ensembles. In agreement with previous work, we project widespread yield losses in the Sahel region and Southern Africa, resilience in Central Africa, and sub-regional increases in East Africa and at the southern tip of the continent. Spatial patterns of yield losses corresponded with spatial patterns of aridity increases, which were explicitly evaluated. Internal variability was a major source of uncertainty in both within-model and between-model ensembles and explained the majority of the spatial distribution of uncertainty in yield projections. Projected climate change impacts on maize production in different regions and nations ranged from near-zero or positive (upper quartile estimates) to substantially negative (lower quartile estimates), highlighting a need for risk management strategies that are adaptive and robust to uncertainty.","Spatial ecology,Impact assessment,Global warming,Environmental science,Coupled model intercomparison project,Climatology,Climate model,Climate change,Arid,Agriculture,Physics,Meteorology,Earth system science,Predictability,Physics,Ocean general circulation model,South asia,Natural resource economics,Malnutrition,Yield gap,Sustainability,Population growth,Tropics,Representative Concentration Pathways,Food security,Surface air temperature,Spatial variability,Physics,Primary production,Plant cover,Land use,Temperate climate,Plant production,Food security,Probabilistic logic,Physics,Meteorology,Uncertainty analysis,Transient climate simulation,Simulation modeling","Amy Dale,Charles Fant,Kenneth Strzepek,Megan Lickley,Susan Solomon,Karl E.

This program grew to a total of 43 designated ESA schemes in the UK as a whole, 22 of which were in England. A variety of agri-environmental payments programs were created to supplement and complement the ESA schemes in years to follow. The most prominent of these in England was the Countryside Stewardship Scheme (CSS), established in 1991. The CSS was available to farmers outside the ESAs, and like the ESA program, was intended to protect valued landscapes and habitats and to improve public enjoyment of the countryside. By 2003, over 10% of England's agricultural land was enrolled in either ESA or CSS agreements. These voluntary agreements were long-term contracts (usually for 10Â years) between the government and farmers to provide environmental services. Several major evaluations of the ESA program and the CSS were conducted over the years, and the results of many of those evaluations and the lessons derived are synthesized and summarized in this article. Both the ESA program and the CSS proved to be generally effective in enrolling many farmers in the entry-level contract tiers, thereby halting or slowing degradation of rural landscape and other environmental features. However, the schemes did not generally offer sufficient economic incentives to attract high levels of enrollment in the intensive farming areas. Also, the schemes were limited in their success in enrolling farmers in higher payment tiers, tiers that required more substantial changes in farming practices. The high crop and livestock-related payments received by farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) contributed to the disincentives to participate, especially in higher tiers.

The data available from commercial growers, however, is of variable duration, due to commercial considerations. We employ a recently proposed regression technique termed Variable-Domain Functional Regression in order to be able to accommodate these irregular-length datasets. In this way, we are able to quantify the contribution of covariates such as temperature, humidity and water spraying volumes across the growing process, and for different lengths of growing processes. Our results indicate that optimal oxygen and temperature levels vary across the growing cycle and we propose environmental schedules for these covariates to optimise overall yields.","Statistics,Statistical model,Schedule,Regression,Precision agriculture,Mathematics,Functional regression,Functional data analysis,Ecology,Covariate,Agaricus bisporus,Mixed model,Mathematics,Mathematical optimization,Smoothness,Purely functional,Principal component analysis,Wireless sensor network,Wireless,Traceability,Wireless,Unavailability,Computer science,Wireless sensor network,Wireless,Traceability,Truncation,Thin plate spline,Statistics,Zoom,Speech recognition,Pattern recognition,Fungal morphology,Environmental impact assessment,Crop production,Surface finish,Statistics,Nonparametric regression,Wireless sensor network,Wireless,System on a chip","Efstathios Panayi,Gareth W.

The aim of the present study was to compare wheat production in dryland (low input) and irrigated (high input) systems in terms of energy ratio, energy efficiency, benefit/cost ratio and amount of renewable energy use. Data were collected from 50 irrigated and 50 dryland wheat growers by using a face-to-face questionnaire in 2009. The results showed that the total energy requirement under low input was 9354.2Â MJÂ ha-1, whereas under high input systems it was 45367.6Â MJÂ ha-1. Total energy input consumed in both dryland and irrigated systems could be classified as direct, indirect, renewable and non-renewable energies which average in two wheat production systems were 47%, 53%, 24% and 76%, respectively. Energy ratios of 3.38 in dryland and 1.44 in irrigated systems were achieved. The benefit-cost ratios were 2.56 in dryland and 1.97 in irrigated wheat production systems.

Water footprints (WFs) are being increasingly used to indicate the impacts of water use by production systems. A new methodology to assess WF of wine was developed in the framework of the V.I.V.A. project (Valutazione Impatto Viticoltura sull'Ambiente), launched by the Italian Ministry for the Environment in 2011 to improve the Italian wine sector's sustainability. The new methodology has been developed that enables different vines from the same winery to be compared. This was achieved by calculating the gray water footprint, following Tier III approach proposed by Hoekstra et al. (2011) . The impact of water use during the life cycle of grape-wine production was assessed for six different wines from the same winery in Sicily, Italy using both the newly developed methodology (V.I.V.A.) and the classical methodology proposed by the Water Footprint Network (WFN). In all cases green water was the largest contributor to WF, but the new methodology also detected differences between vines of the same winery. Furthermore, V.I.V.A. methodology assesses water body contamination by pesticides application whereas the WFN methodology considers just fertilization. This fact ended highlights the highest WF of vineyard 4 calculated by V.I.V.A. if compared with the WF calculated with WFN methodology. Comparing the WF of wine produced with grapes from the six different wines, the factors most greatly influencing the results obtained in this study were: distance from the water body, fertilization rate, amount and eco-toxicological behavior of the active ingredients used.","Winery,Wine,Water use,Vineyard,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Environmental indicator,Environmental engineering,Engineering,Agriculture,Lysimeter,Irrigation management,Evapotranspiration,Water use,Water transport,Water supply,Water use,Water pollution,Water balance,Water supply,Water resources,Water resource management,Waterlogging (agriculture),Water pollution,Surface water,Botany,Biology,Water use,Water resources,Water resource management,Winery,Water use,Water resources,Wine,Supply chain,Partial system,Water use,Vulnerability,Virtual water","Lucrezia Lamastra,Nicoleta Alina Suciu,Elisa Novelli,Marco Trevisan,Richard G.

177,The roles of public and private actors in the governance of adaptation: the case of agricultural insurance in India,2012-01-01,LSE Research Online Documents on Economics,,"Climate change adaptation is an increasingly important field and will involve a range of actors from national governments to private companies, communities and households. There is a growing policy discourse supporting the involvement of the private sector in adaptation, however there is little empirical examination to show how the sector might be involved and how adaptation might be governed. This paper uses evidence from the field of risk governance and insurance and analytical frameworks from the wider governance literature to draw important findings for the governance of adaptation. We use the recently published Compendium of Disaster Risk Initiatives in the Developing World and a case study of agricultural insurance in India to argue that the role of the private sector is increasing but so far within a particular model of engagement. In the context of climate change, how the public-private relationships are constructed is key to how adaptation can be leveraged from such an arrangement. The evidence in this paper suggests that due to commercial viability and other concerns there will continue to be a role for the public sector alongside the private sector to ensure adaptation measures address vulnerability. In conclusion we argue that the type of relationship between the public and the private actors has a significant influence on the adaptation outcomes. The question is not purely about involving the private sector which is how this is currently framed within policy and academic work on adaptation, but how the private actors are engaged. . Governments seeking to engage private actors need to build those relationships with the desired adaptation outcomes in mind.","Vulnerability,Risk governance,Public sector,Public economics,Private sector,Leverage (finance),Economics,Economic growth,Developing country,Corporate governance,Agriculture,Working group,Political economy of climate change,Extreme events,Vulnerability,Sustainability,Normative,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Focus group,Financial system,Business,Political science,Political economy,National state,Vulnerability,Risk analysis (engineering),Path dependent,Vulnerability,Sustainability science,Psychological resilience,Vulnerability assessment,Political economy of climate change,Human systems engineering,Vulnerability,Sustainable development,Stern Review,Sustainable development,Landscape ecology,Global warming","Susannah Fisher,Swenja Surminski,Christopher B.

After Spain, Italy is the second largest olive oil producing country (27% and 20% of European and world production respectively) and Sicily is the third most important olive oil producing region in Italy (8% of Italian production) after Puglia and Calabria which account for almost 70% of national production. In Sicily, the province of Messina occupies sixth place in regional production and production is characterized by eight predominant cultivars (with different nutritional, organoleptic and productivity characteristics) and a variety of different practices and techniques for the agricultural production of olives and for their processing into olive oil. Depending on these differences, the production of olive oil is associated with several adverse effects on the environment, both in the agricultural and olive oil production phases. The aim of this paper is to provide useful information for taking strategic decisions aimed at the improvement and optimization of the local olive oil production chain in the province of Messina. To this purpose the LCA methodology has been used to determine the potential environmental impacts of activities connected to olive oil production in the province, in order to identify the processes which give rise to the most significant environmental problems and to design a more efficient and environmentally friendly local olive oil chain. Data on the various agricultural and industrial methods used in the province were obtained through the development of a questionnaire, then distributed to a sample of companies of the local association of oil producers (APOM). The study is part of the Eco-Management for Food - EMAF - Project (PRIN 2008 No. 2008TXFBYT - http://ww2.unime.it/emaf ) co-funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR).","Production chain,Olive oil,Local association,Life-cycle assessment,European union,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Economics,Christian ministry,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Agricultural productivity,Sustainable products,Life-cycle assessment,Information sharing,Product category,Life-cycle assessment,Food products,Waste management,Soil type,Soil contamination,Statistics,Product life-cycle management,Pesticide,Waste management,Resource consumption,Raw material,Product system,Novel food,Life-cycle assessment,Wastewater,Waste-to-energy,Waste treatment technologies,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Scarcity,Wastewater,Waste management,Strategic approach,Windrow,Wastewater,Waste management","Roberta Salomone,Giuseppe Ioppolo,Poritosh Roy,Daisuke Nei,Takahiro Orikasa,Qingyi Xu,Hiroshi Okadome,Erwin Meissner Schau,Annik Magerholm Fet,Frank Brentrup,Jürgen Küsters,Joachim Lammel,Hermann Kuhlmann,Morten Birkved,Michael Zwicky Hauschild,M.

In this study, LCA was used as a ‘support tool’, to address local policies for sustainable production and consumption patterns, and to create a ‘knowledge base’ for environmental assessment of an extended agricultural production area. The proposed approach combines organisation-specific tools, such as Environmental Management Systems and Environmental Product Declarations, with the environmental management of the district. Questionnaires were distributed to producers to determine the life cycle of different protected crops (tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, peppers, melons and zucchinis), and obtain information on greenhouse usage (e.g. tunnel vs. pavilion). Ecoprofiles of products in the district were also estimated, to identify supply chain elements with the highest impact in terms of global energy requirements, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication, water consumption and waste production. These results of this study enable selection of the ‘best practices’ and ecodesign solutions, to reduce the environmental impact of these products. Finally, sensitivity analysis of key LCA issues was performed, to assess the variability associated with different parameters: vegetable production; water usage; fertiliser and pesticide usage; shared greenhouse use; substitution of plastics coverings; and waste recycling.","Waste management,Life-cycle assessment,Greenhouse gas,Greenhouse,Environmental management system,Environmental impact assessment,Engineering,Ecodesign,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Life-cycle assessment,Inventory analysis,Impact assessment,Waste management,Organic milk,Organic farming,White paper,Medicine,Food science,Water quality,Organic farming,Intensive farming,Life-cycle assessment,Environmental science,Environmental planning,Upland rice,Sustainable agriculture,Paddy field,Transaction cost,Supply chain risk management,Supply chain management,Transportation distance,Total energy,Operations management,Life-cycle assessment,Integrated farming,Environmental planning,Waste management,Soil type,Soil contamination","Maurizio Cellura,Fulvio Ardente,Sonia Longo,Walter Klöpffer,Christel Cederberg,Berit Mattsson,Stephen Fallows,Guido Haas,Frank Wetterich,Ulrich Köpke,R Clift,A Audsley,S Alber,S Cowell,P Crettaz,Gian Andrea Blengini,Mirko Busto,George A Zsidisin,Sue P Siferd,Annika Carlsson-Kanyama,Marianne Pipping Ekström,Helena Shanahan,L.

The present paper aims to present and discuss the results of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) performed on 13 tomato based products (tomato puree, chopped tomatoes and peeled tomatoes in tomato juice) produced in Italy by a Group representing one of largest agri-food industry European companies. The environmental hotspots of the whole supply chains of the investigated products have been identified and technical and managerial solutions have been defined. Agricultural phase and packaging production resulted to be the life-cycle stages with the highest impact in all the considered categories. The identified improvement options related to packaging subsystem are the reduction of weight and the switch to different packaging materials. Other improvement options can be adopted in the cultivation phase, such as use of organic fertilizers or inorganic fertilizers with lower nitrogen and phosphorus content, crop rotation and use of efficient irrigation systems.

Using survey data collected from 973 organic farmers in three German regions during the spring of 2004, some implications of the conventionalization hypothesis are tested. Early and late adopters of organic farming are compared concerning farm structure, environmental concern, attitudes to organic farming, and membership in organic-movement organizations. The results indicate that organic farming in the study regions indeed exhibits signs of incipient conventionalization. On average, newer farms are more specialized and slightly larger than established ones and there is a growing proportion of farmers who do not share pro-environmental attitudes. Additionally, a number, albeit small, of very large, highly specialized farms have adopted organic agriculture in the last years. However, the vast majority of organic farmers, new and old ones included, still show a strong pro-environmental orientation.

The case of the French metropolitan area of Paris ☆,2013-01-01,Food Policy,10.1016/J.FOODPOL.2013.04.006,"The development of short supply food chains (SSFCs) is a noteworthy phenomenon in Europe. This paper questions whether these SSFC contribute or not to the preservation and/or development of urban agriculture in the Ile-de-France Region (Paris and surrounding areas), where agriculture still represents a major land use activity (more than 50%). Based on documentary and empirical research the analysis shows that a quarter of farms are involved in SSFC in this region. Taking different forms, these SSFC initiatives are for the majority very recent, they often develop in the frame of hybrid forms of farming. Even though the contribution of SSFC in the total food supply of the Parisian region is poorly informed, and probably very small, the recent interest of consumers, inhabitants, and territorial stakeholders in organic and/or local food is real and has encouraged various types of incentives and commitments. The development of SSFC in the Paris region nevertheless faces numerous obstacles such as the scarcity of land and labour and the environmental impacts that still remain controversial. Promoting the role of SSFCs in the preservation of a sustainable urban agriculture requires access to more statistical and comparative data, which are currently unavailable.","Urban agriculture,Short food supply chains,Scarcity,Natural resource economics,Metropolitan area,Land use,Incentive,Empirical research,Economics,Economic growth,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Social proximity,Social network,Organizational structure,Social science,Short food supply chains,Rural development,Phenomenon,Grid,Economy,Sustainable agriculture,Short food supply chains,Scrutiny,Urbanization,Urban agriculture,Poverty,Typology,Three level,Supply chain,Short food supply chains,Separate spheres,Rural development,Urban planning,Urban agriculture,Social science,Sociology,Short food supply chains,Natural resource economics,Social science,Short food supply chains,Economics","Christine Aubry,Leïla Kebir,Ron Boschma,Henk Renting,Terry K Marsden,Jo Banks,Andre Torre,Alain Rallet,Michael Winter,Alberto Zezza,Luca Tasciotti,Terry Marsden,Jo Banks,Gillian Bristow,Roberta Sonnino,Terry Keith Marsden,Kevin John Morgan,David Goodman,D Watts,Brian W Ilbery,Damian M Maye",https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:jfpoli:v:41:y:2013:i:c:p:85-93,145,agriculture case study greenhouse gas

The challenge is to deliver a transformation of agricultural productivity in such systems without adverse impacts on environmental goods and services. We examine the growing advocacy of ‘conservation agriculture’ (CA) as the desired approach and assess the evidence to support the assertion that it can deliver sustainable agricultural development in SSA. We examine in particular the evidence which derives from experience with ‘zero tillage sustainable agriculture’ in Brazil. We ask the question, is there a case for a paradigm shift in land husbandry? The case for a paradigm shift hangs on the premise that conventional practice promotes land degradation, while adoption of CA practice delivers a range of benefits through promoting soil ecosystem health. The guiding principle is to promote biological tillage through minimizing mechanical soil disturbance and maintaining permanent organic soil cover. We examine evidence of benefits in the context of the wider debate on low-external-input technology. We conclude that CA does not overcome constraints on low-external-input systems and will deliver the productivity gains that are required to achieve food security and poverty targets only if farmers have access to fertilizers and herbicides. We conclude also that widespread adoption of the new paradigm amongst millions of small farmers in order to achieve the ‘doubly green revolution’ in SSA is subject to the familiar constraints of knowledge transfer and success will depend upon creating innovation networks. Further, we conclude that amongst small-scale farmers partial adoption will be the norm and it is not clear that this will deliver soil health benefits claimed for full adoption of the new paradigm.","Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Soil science,Paradigm shift,Land degradation,Green Revolution,Food security,Chemistry,Agronomy,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Water scarcity,Water resources,Water industry,Tillage,Soil water,Soil science,Water supply,Water resources,Water industry,Water-use efficiency,Sustainability,Poverty,Total organic carbon,Soil water,Soil management,Tillage,Soil organic matter,No-till farming,Tillage,Strip-till,Soybean management practices,Stock (geology),Spatial planning,Soil organic matter,World population,Water resources,Scarcity,Tillage,Soil organic matter,Soil management","John Gowing,Michael Palmer,David J.

185,Viability study of the use of grid connected photovoltaic system in agriculture: Case of Algerian dairy farms,2016-01-01,Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews,10.1016/J.RSER.2016.05.066,"To meet the rising electricity demand and decreasing produced gas, the Algerian government plans for the installation of 22GW of renewable energy by 2030 and it ensures the purchase of the produced electricity. The photovoltaic energy will be the first energy with 13.5GW. In this paper, the performances of the photovoltaic systems destined to supplying the dairy farm and the grid in a rural environment have been studied. The methodology is based on the irrigation and lighting optimization. Whereby, the quality of lighting (150–250lx) in cow building and irrigation has a direct impact on the production of milk and the growth of crop plants, respectively. The system is optimized by computational program, using global solar radiation and the electricity consumption profile of the dairy farm. A computational program is developed to define the appropriate motor-pump, number of lamps, photovoltaic surface and investment cost. After optimization, the farm becomes a complementary source of photovoltaic electricity 34MWh/year. The consumed energy of farm from the grid decreases with 67%, and the injected energy is estimated at 30.9MWh/year, the produced milk increases with 8% and the CO2 emission decreases with 68%. Hence, the dairy farm becomes an electricity producer instead of electricity consumer with less environmental damage.","Waste management,Stand-alone power system,Renewable energy,Photovoltaic system,Grid-connected photovoltaic power system,Grid,Engineering,Electricity retailing,Electricity,Agriculture,Systems engineering,Sustainable energy,Renewable energy,Wind power,Renewable resource,Renewable energy credit,Waste management,Sizing,Simulation,Wind speed,Waste management,Photovoltaics,Waste management,Renewable energy,Photovoltaic system,Voltage,Solar energy,Renewable energy,Renewable energy,Operations research,Isolated system,Renewable energy,Power electronics,Microgrid,Task group,Risk assessment,Public body,Wind power,Water pumping,Waste management","M.

There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the broad-scale and prophylactic uses of neonicotinoids pose serious risks of harm to beneficial organisms and their ecological function. This provides the impetus for exploring alternatives to neonicotinoid insecticides for controlling insect pests. We draw from examples of alternative pest control options in Italian maize production and Canadian forestry to illustrate the principles of applying alternatives to neonicotinoids under an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy. An IPM approach considers all relevant and available information to make informed management decisions, providing pest control options based on actual need. We explore the benefits and challenges of several options for management of three insect pests in maize crops and an invasive insect pest in forests, including diversifying crop rotations, altering the timing of planting, tillage and irrigation, using less sensitive crops in infested areas, applying biological control agents, and turning to alternative reduced risk insecticides. Continued research into alternatives is warranted, but equally pressing is the need for information transfer and training for farmers and pest managers and the need for policies and regulations to encourage the adoption of IPM strategies and their alternative pest control options.","Pest control,PEST analysis,Neonicotinoid,Mechanical pest control,Integrated pest management,Forestry,Crop rotation,Chemistry,Biological pest control,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Toxicology,Thiamethoxam,Pesticide,Zoology,Pollen,Pesticide toxicity to bees,Pollinator,Pesticide,Pest control,Virtual screening,Thiacloprid,Rational design,Toxicology,Seed treatment,Pesticide resistance,Woody plant,Soil water,Pesticide,Functional ecology,Foundation species,Energy flow,Urban forest,Tetrastichus planipennisi,Spathius galinae,Neonicotinoid,Marine habitats,Lumbricidae,Sodium channel,Serine hydrolase,Pharmacology","Lorenzo Furlan,David Kreutzweiser,Mickaël Henry,Maxime Béguin,Fabrice Requier,Orianne Rollin,Jean-François Odoux,Penelope R Whitehorn,Stephanie O'Connor,Felix L Wackers,Dave Goulson,Dave Goulson,Peter Jeschke,Ralf Nauen,Michael Schindler,Alfred Elbert,N.

Some efforts have been made to investigate the determinants of LALIs at the global level; however, scare evidence abounds regarding the characteristics of target communities in a given country particularly in Nigeria, one of the top 20 recipients of LALIs globally. This study contributes by showing how community characteristics influence the likelihood of receiving LALIs and the aspects of such community characteristics that matter. Utilising community-level data in Nigeria and estimating with probit model, some findings are made. Unexpectedly, the indicators of local institutions in the communities do not exert significant influence on the likelihood of LALIs occurrence. This supposes that the local institutions are rather overwhelmed by the state. How the local institutions can be integrated for LALIs are suggested.","Rural area,Probit model,Environmental protection,Economics,Agriculture,Agricultural land,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Rural poverty,Social science,Social analysis,Quarter century,Water grabbing,Rural area,Land use,Western world,Soviet union,Social science,Political science,Land rights,Humanities,Security of tenure,Property rights,Microeconomics,Sovereign state,Private sector,Land grabbing,Strategic positioning,Speculation,Phenomenon,Transparency (graphic),Tragedy,Poverty,Politics,Phenomenon,Media coverage","Evans S.

Over the years, many urban growth models have been developed and used in the developed countries for forecasting growth patterns. In the developing countries however, there exist a very few studies showing the application of these models and their performances. In this study two models such as cellular automata (CA) and the SLEUTH models are applied in a geographical information system (GIS) to simulate and predict the urban growth and land use change for the City of Sana’a (Yemen) for the period 2004–2020. GIS based maps were generated for the urban growth pattern of the city which was further analyzed using geo-statistical techniques. During the models calibration process, a total of 35 years of time series dataset such as historical topographical maps, aerial photographs and satellite imageries was used to identify the parameters that influenced the urban growth. The validation result showed an overall accuracy of 99.6 %; with the producer’s accuracy of 83.3 % and the user’s accuracy 83.6 %. The SLEUTH model used the best fit growth rule parameters during the calibration to forecasting future urban growth pattern and generated various probability maps in which the individual grid cells are urbanized assuming unique “urban growth signatures”. The models generated future urban growth pattern and land use changes from the period 2004–2020. Both models proved effective in forecasting growth pattern that will be useful in planning and decision making. In comparison, the CA model growth pattern showed high density development, in which growth edges were filled and clusters were merged together to form a compact built-up area wherein less agricultural lands were included. On the contrary, the SLEUTH model growth pattern showed more urban sprawl and low-density development that included substantial areas of agricultural lands.","Urban sprawl,Topographic map,Metropolitan area,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Information system,Hydrology,Geology,Environmental engineering science,Cartography,Agriculture,Visualization,Urbanization,Simulation,Urbanization,Urban planning,Urban area,Urban land,Urban form,Theoretical computer science,Training set,Spatial variable,Machine learning,Urban sprawl,Urban planning,Topographic map,Visualization,Urban modeling,Subdivision,Urban area,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Realm,Model development,Management science,Process management,Planning support systems,Computer science,Urban planning,Urban density,Sustainable development","Mohamed Al-shalabi,Lawal Billa,Biswajeet Pradhan,Shattri Mansor,Abubakr A.

Consequently, efforts are being made to provide farmers with adaptation technologies, but little empirical research exists on the determinants of adopting such technologies. This article addresses this research gap, using the case of drought tolerant maize (DTM) technology in Nigeria. With survey data from 200 farm households and econometric techniques, we explore the determinants of whether to invest and how much to invest in adaptation technology by smallholder farmers. Results from the study indicate that among the key determinants of adoption are access to the technology, complementary inputs, extension services, and climate change information. We also show that off-farm income and wealth status of a household play a significant role in adoption, implying capital constraints; hence, it can be difficult for resource-poor farmers to adopt the technology. Moreover, the farmers identified cost of the technology and complementary inputs, particularly fertilizer as major constraints to adoption. We conclude that while the DTM technology is suitable and important in helping smallholder maize farmers to continue to produce under a changing climate, more support is needed for them to invest in the technology and overcome adoption constraints. Necessary interventions include improving access to information about climate change and the available adaptation technology, timely access to the technology and complementary inputs, and improving access to credit, particularly for the resource-poor farm households.","Survey data collection,Psychological intervention,Empirical research,Economics,Drought tolerance,Climate change,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural machinery,Sampling (statistics),Population,Panel data,Vulnerability,Sustainability,Latin Americans,Working group,Vulnerability,Sustainability and systemic change resistance,Public administration,Political science,Group ii,Socioeconomic status,Population,Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys,Political economy of climate change,Natural resource economics,Climate change,Tree planting,Soil conservation,Socioeconomics,Variables,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Crop,Climate change,Biology,Sociology,Sociological theory of diffusion,Product innovation","Justice Akpene Tambo,Tahirou Abdoulaye,Jeffrey M Wooldridge,Martin Parry,Osvaldo Canziani,Jean Palutikof,Paul van der Linden,Clair Hanson,Martin Parry,Osvaldo Canziani,Jean-Pascal van Ypersele de Strihou,Jean Palutikof,M.L.

Such processing should be considered in the framework of a nutrient management planning (NMP) designed under local conditionals and considering cultivable soils as the end-users. In this context, decision on individual or collective scale should not be regarded as a main objective per se since such election should result from the NMP study and design. This paper is aimed to review existing experiences on manure treatment in NE Spain (Catalonia), either at farm or large scale. Some common factors identified in the successful experiences described are the involvement of farmers, technology suppliers and related authorities; energy and fertilizers prices; and the existence of a NMP as a global framework for actuations. Economical factors affecting decision about management and treatment scale are influenced by the density and the intensity of farming in a given area, which favour centralized NMPs and allow optimizing logistics.","Waste management,Nutrient management,Manure,Livestock manure,Chemistry,Centralisation,Arable land,Animal waste,Agriculture,Waste treatment,Waste management,Slurry,Treatment strategy,Sustainable agriculture,Manure management,Struvite,Nitrogen,Manure,Waste management,Screw press,Particle-size distribution,Sludge,Sedimentation,Pulp and paper industry,Total suspended solids,Total dissolved solids,Suspended solids,Waste management,Pipeline transport,Pipeline (computing),Waste management,Total dissolved solids,Slurry,Waste management,Nutrient,Nitrification,Waste management,Slurry,Nitrous oxide","Xavier Flotats,August Bonmatí,Belén Fernández,Albert Magrí,August Bonmatı́,Xavier Flotats,C.H.

The supervised classification technique by maximum likelihood classifier has been employed to create a classified image and has been assessed based on Kappa index. The urban sprawl was also measured using Shannon’s entropy based on its primary spatial forms. To our knowledge, measuring urban sprawl based on its spatial forms would contribute to prioritizing policies and specific regulations in dealing with its dominant form. Finally, LCLU change and urban growth were simulated for 2022, using CA-Markov model. The results revealed that dramatic growth of built-up areas has led to a significant decrease in the area of agriculture, gardens and wasteland, from 1987 to 2013. The obtained relative entropy values have indicated that the Qom city has experienced increasing urban sprawling over the last three decades. The continuous linear and non-continuous linear developments along the major roads and highways are the dominant forms of sprawl in Qom city. The CA-Markov model estimated that this unsustainable trend will continue in the future and built-up areas will be increased by 10% by 2022 resulting in potential loss of 438.03 ha agriculture land, 638.37 ha wasteland, and 17.01 ha gardens.

198,Empirical approaches for assessing impacts of climate change on agriculture: The EcoCrop model and a case study with grain sorghum,2013-01-01,Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,10.1016/J.AGRFORMET.2011.09.005,"Abstract Climate has been changing in the last three decades and will continue changing regardless of any mitigation strategy. Agriculture is a climate-dependent activity and hence is highly sensitive to climatic changes and climate variability. Nevertheless, there is a knowledge gap when agricultural researchers intend to assess the production of minor crops for which data or models are not available. Therefore, we integrated the current expert knowledge reported in the FAO-EcoCrop database, with the basic mechanistic model (also named EcoCrop), originally developed by Hijmans et al. (2001) . We further developed the model, providing calibration and evaluation procedures. To that aim, we used sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor Moench) as a case study and both calibrated EcoCrop for the sorghum crop and analyzed the impacts of the SRES-A1B 2030s climate on sorghum climatic suitability. The model performed well, with a high true positive rate (TPR) and a low false negative rate (FNR) under present conditions when assessed against national and subnational agricultural statistics (min TPR = 0.967, max FNR = 0.026). The model predicted high sorghum climatic suitability in areas where it grows optimally and matched the sorghum geographic distribution fairly well. Negative impacts were predicted by 2030s. Vulnerabilities in countries where sorghum cultivation is already marginal are likely (with a high degree of certainty): the western Sahel region, southern Africa, northern India, and the western coast of India are particularly vulnerable. We highlight the considerable opportunity of using EcoCrop to assess global food security issues, broad climatic constraints and regional crop-suitability shifts in the context of climate change and the possibility of coupling it with other large-area approaches.","Vulnerability,Sorghum,Impact assessment,Food security,Environmental impact assessment,Ecology,Crop,Climatology,Climate change,Biology,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Weather station,Spatial variability,Spatial ecology,South asia,Natural resource economics,Malnutrition,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report,HadCM3,Environmental science,Primary production,Plant cover,Land use,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report,Global warming,Environmental science,Specification,Sorghum,Panel analysis,Rainfed agriculture,Multiple cropping,Irrigation,Transpiration,Soil water,Simulation modeling,Thermohaline circulation,Sea level,Meteorology,Sustainability,Food systems,Food security","Julian Ramirez-Villegas,Andy Jarvis,Peter Läderach,Robert J.

199,Heat Stress Perception among Native and Migrant Workers in Italian Industries-Case Studies from the Construction and Agricultural Sectors.,2019-01-01,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,10.3390/IJERPH16071090,"Climate change will increase the frequency and severity of hazard events such as heat waves, with important effects in several European regions. It is of importance to consider overall effects as well as specific impact on vulnerable population groups such as outdoor workers. The agricultural and construction sectors represent two strategic occupational fields that in relatively recent years involve an increasing number of migrant workers, and therefore require a better management of cultural aspects, that may interact with and impact on heat-related health risk. For this reason, the present study evaluated heat-stress perception and management among native and immigrant workers in Europe. As part of the EU’s Horizon 2020 HEAT-SHIELD project (grant agreement No. 668786), two agricultural and one construction companies, traditionally employing migrant workers, were evaluated with a questionnaire survey during the summer months of 2017. The data collected (104 case studies) were analyzed using descriptive statistics (Chi-squared tests) and the analysis of variance was performed with ANOVA test. From the results, migrant workers declared that work required greater effort than do native Italian workers (χ2 = 17.1, p = 0.001) but reported less impact from heat on productivity (χ2 = 10.6; p = 0.014) and thermal discomfort. In addition, migrant workers were mainly informed through written or oral communications, while native workers received information on heat-health issues through training courses.

200,Variability and time series trend analysis of rainfall and temperature in northcentral Ethiopia: A case study in Woleka sub-basin,2017-01-01,Weather and climate extremes,10.1016/J.WACE.2017.12.002,"Abstract Examining the spatiotemporal dynamics of meteorological variables in the context of changing climate, particularly in countries where rainfed agriculture is predominant, is vital to assess climate-induced changes and suggest feasible adaptation strategies. To that end, trend analysis has been employed to inspect the change of rainfall and temperature in northcentral Ethiopia using gridded monthly precipitation data obtained from Global Precipitation and Climate Centre (GPCC V7) and temperature data from Climate Research Unit (CRU TS 3.23) with 0.5° by 0.5° resolution from 1901 to 2014. Data have been analyzed using coefficient of variation, anomaly index, precipitation concentration index and Palmer drought severity index. Furthermore, Mann-Kendall test was used to detect the time series trend. The result revealed intra- and inter-annual variability of rainfall while Palmer drought severity index value proved the increasing trend of the number of drought years. Annual, belg and kiremt rainfall have decreased with a rate of 15.03, 1.93 and 13.12 mm per decade respectively. The declining trend for annual and kiremt rainfall was found to be statistically significant while that of belg was not significant. The rate of change of temperature was found to be 0.046, 0.067 and 0.026  °C per decade for mean, minimum and maximum respectively. The Mann-Kendall trend analysis test result revealed increasing trend for mean and minimum average temperatures through time significantly while the trend for maximum temperature exhibited a non-significant increasing trend. We recommend strategies designed in the agricultural sector have to take the declining and erratic nature of rainfall and increasing trend of temperature into consideration.","Trend analysis,Structural basin,Rainfed agriculture,Precipitation,Momentum (technical analysis),Maximum temperature,Environmental science,Cru,Climatology,Agriculture,Vulnerability,Sustainability,Latin Americans,Trend analysis,Time series,Statistics,Watershed,Surface runoff,Structural basin,Tropical Eastern Pacific,Trend analysis,Teleconnection,Rift valley,Precipitation index,Precipitation,Watershed,Trend surface analysis,Trend analysis,Wet season,Storm track,Precipitation,Trend analysis,Geology,Climatology,Statistical mean,Statistical analysis,Precipitation,Wet season,Research quality,Physics","Amogne Asfaw,Belay Simane,Ali Hassen,Amare Bantider,Martin Parry,Osvaldo Canziani,Jean Palutikof,Paul van der Linden,Clair Hanson,Sheng Yue,Paul Pilon,George Cavadias,Marius-Victor Birsan,Peter Molnar,Paolo Burlando,Martin Pfaundler,Yilma Seleshi,Ulrich Zanke,Ellen Marie Viste,Diriba Korecha,Asgeir Sorteberg,Wing H.

201,A Novel Agribusiness Model for Backward Linkages with Farmers: A Case of Food Retail Chain,2007-01-01,Agricultural Economics Research Review,,"One of the leading food retail chains, ‘Spencers’ have established backward linkages with farmers for procuring fresh fruits and vegetables. The main strategy of this system ensures a steady and continuous supply of fresh vegetables to the food retail chain and flow of income to farmers. This linkage has been able to change the method of farming and the marketing arrangement followed by the food retail chains. The marketing arrangement by Spencers food retail chain has reduced the market risks and transaction cost of farmers and has helped them in breaking away from the clutches of traditional brokers/wholesalers/commission agents. Direct supply by farmers has allowed the retail chain to simultaneously increase control over quality, supply reliability and price stability. An added advantage of this model is that it provides flexibility to the farmers to exit from this system, if they are not satisfied with its functioning, since there are no written contracts. This model of linkage is specially suited to small and marginal farmers and improves their economic conditions by providing an opportunity to grow and supply high-value vegetables round the year at a fairly decent price. The study has analyzed the impact of food retail chain linkage on farmers.","Transaction cost,Price of stability,Marketing,Market risk,Linkage (mechanical),Fruits and vegetables,Economics,Commission,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Agribusiness,Spell,Rapid rise,Poverty,Safety standards,Retail trade,Retail sector,Staple food,Procurement,Middle class","K.P.

Due to a more effective and efficient management and procurement system, the supermarkets can benefit from economics of scale and sell food at a relative low price. In this paper, we present a case study of two villages in the Transkei area of South Africa. In these poor rural communities, the majority of households now buy their main food items from supermarkets rather than from local shops and farmers. While presenting an important step towards livelihood development and food security, these supermarkets form also a strong competitor for local agricultural sales. The supermarkets provide many food items at lower prices. With an increase in income, the households look for variety and exotism in their food products, and will most likely find this in the supermarkets, rather than the local stores. We argue therefore that development programs should focus on the local growers’ access to the supermarket procurement systems.","Procurement,Livelihood,Latin Americans,Food security,Food products,Economies of scale,Economics,Developing country,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Rapid rise,Procurement,Latin Americans,Safety standards,Retail trade,Retail sector,Socioeconomics,Rural poverty,Rural area,Rural development,Economic growth,Business,Public concern,Market economy,Manufacturing,Social accounting,Rural area,Net income,Supply chain,Procurement,Private sector,Poverty,Latin Americans,Labour economics,Safety standards,Public health,Procurement,Service economy,Post-industrial economy,Political economy of climate change","Marijke D’Haese,Guido Van Huylenbroeck,Thomas Reardon,C.

The system investigated includes the production of the chemical inputs used (fertilisers and pesticides), agricultural processes, the industrial processing and the transportation and waste management associated with olive oil production. Raw material and energy use as well as emissions were quantified on the basis of a functional unit of 1 l of extra virgin olive oil. The production of the inorganic fertilisers used in the agricultural stage of olive oil production and the disposal of liquid effluent from olive mills to evaporation ponds were found to be “hot-spot” processes not only in terms of resource consumption but also in terms of emissions into the environment.","Waste management,Resource consumption,Raw material,Pollutant,Pesticide,Olive oil,Evaporation pond,Environmental engineering,Effluent,Economics,Agriculture,Life-cycle assessment,Inventory analysis,Environmental resource management,Environmental science,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural economics,Rye bread,Reliability engineering,Mean value,Life-cycle assessment,Environmental science,Environmental planning,Wastewater,Waste disposal,Soil water,Wastewater,Pulp and paper industry,Phenols,Wastewater,Waste management,Reducing sugar,Waste management,Refining (metallurgy),Raw material,Waste management,Tomato products,Tomato ketchup,Life-cycle assessment,Environmental resource management,Environmental planning","M.

205,Closing the yield gap could reduce projected greenhouse gas emissions: a case study of maize production in China.,2013-01-01,Global Change Biology,10.1111/GCB.12213,"Although the goal of doubling food demand while simultaneously reducing agricultural environmental damage has become widely accepted, the dominant agricultural paradigm still considers high yields and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity to be in conflict with one another. Here, we achieved an increase in maize yield of 70% in on-farm experiments by closing the yield gap and evaluated the trade-off between grain yield, nitrogen (N) fertilizer use, and GHG emissions. Based on two groups of N application experiments in six locations for 16 on-farm site-years, an integrated soil-crop system (HY) approach achieved 93% of the yield potential and averaged 14.8 Mg ha−1 maize grain yield at 15.5% moisture. This is 70% higher than current crop (CC) management. More importantly, the optimal N rate for the HY system was 250 kg N ha−1, which is only 38% more N fertilizer input than that applied in the CC system. Both the N2O emission intensity and GHG intensity increased exponentially as the N application rate increased, and the response curve for the CC system was always higher than that for the HY system. Although the N application rate increased by 38%, N2O emission intensity and the GHG intensity of the HY system were reduced by 12% and 19%, respectively. These on-farm observations indicate that closing the yield gap alongside efficient N management should therefore be prominent among a portfolio of strategies to meet food demand while reducing GHG intensity at the same time.","Yield gap,Nitrogen,Moisture,Greenhouse gas,Fertilizer,Emission intensity,Crop,Biology,Agronomy,Agriculture,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Radiative forcing,Environmental science,Atmospheric sciences,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Waterlogging (agriculture),Leaching (agriculture),Irrigation,Yield gap,Sustainability,Population growth,Technical progress,Plant production,Natural resource economics,Nitrogen,Nanotechnology,Environmental chemistry,Natural resource economics,Liberian dollar,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Nitrogen management,Management practices,Environmental resource management","Zhenling Cui,Shanchao Yue,Guiliang Wang,Qingfeng Meng,Liang Wu,Zhiping Yang,Qiang Zhang,Shiqing Li,Fusuo Zhang,Xinping Chen,H.

Fe, Pb and Se concentrations in most of the water samples exceed the maximum admissible concentration. The heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) shows strong correlations with heavy metal pollution index (HPI) and degree of contamination (Cd), and gives a better assessment of pollution levels. Samples from all the 25 locations in the lake were classified as high in Cd and low in HPI compared with the respective critical values. The modified schemes of HPI and Cd show comparable results with HEI and indicate that about 48 % of the samples with values lower than mean were classed as low contamination and the remaining samples (52 %) with values greater than the mean were classed as medium contamination. Cluster analysis, principal component analysis and pollution indices reveal that the quality of water is mainly controlled by natural/geogenic processes with minor anthropogenic input. US Salinity Laboratory plot and EC classification were also been used to assess the suitability of lake water for agricultural purpose. The current distribution level of heavy metal in the lake water is of environmental and health concerns and needs attention.","Water quality,Salinity,Pollution,Metal contamination,Lake water,Integrated approach,Hydrology,Geology,Environmental engineering,Contamination,Agriculture,Piper diagram,Natural water,Groundwater chemistry,Trace element,Soil water,Quantitative assessment,Statistics,Statistical thinking,Statistical inference,Water quality,Water pollution,Sampling (statistics),Soil water,Soil contamination,Soil classification,Trace element,Total organic carbon,Sediment,Zinc,Soil water,Soil contamination,Pollution,Particulate organic matter,Metalloid,Water quality,Salinity,Pollution,Sustainability,Environmental science,Environmental remediation","M.

To accomplish this aim, the domestication of inherently salt tolerant plant species with economic value is proposed as a straightforward methodology. Most studies investigating salt tolerance mechanisms are linked to small, experimental systems that cannot be generalized to the real agricultural context. The crops Salicornia and Sarcocornia , however, with their extreme salt tolerance and long history of consumption by humans, make the ideal model plants on which to base a halophyte growth strategy. New applied technologies were developed for leafy vegetable production using small-scale greenhouse and in-field studies. Several cultivation systems adapted to the irrigation water salinity and the available soil conditions are described. Daylength manipulation and a repetitive harvest regime partially elucidated the flowering patterns of Salicornia and Sarcocornia and showed that flowering should be prevented for maximal vegetable production. Additionally, the beneficial effect of saline irrigation on quality parameters via the enhancement of stress-induced secondary metabolites with antioxidant capacity should be considered during cultivation. This review summarizes the recent developments in growing halophytes for food production with saline irrigation, using Salicornia and Sarcocornia as a case study.","Soil salinity,Sarcocornia,Salinity,Salicornia,Halophyte,Greenhouse,Crop,Botany,Biology,Agronomy,Agriculture,Thellungiella,Soil salinity,Salinity,Thellungiella,Salt gland,Salinity,Salinity,Quantitative trait locus,Marker-assisted selection,Vitamin C,Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity,Polyphenol,Soil water,Salinity,Phosphate,Soil salinity,Soil functions,Soil fertility,Vacuole,Salicornia bigelovii,Osmoregulation,Salinity measurement,Plant biology,Land management,Silene vulgaris,Scolymus hispanicus,Rubus ulmifolius,Sustainable agriculture,Soil salinity,Salinity","Yvonne Ventura,Moshe Sagi,Jian Kang Zhu,Timothy J.

208,Adaptive management and targeting of agri-environment schemes does benefit biodiversity: a case study of the corn bunting Emberiza calandra,2011-01-01,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/J.1365-2664.2011.01958.X,"Summary 1. Agri-environment schemes (AES) are the main European policy response to biodiversity loss caused by agricultural intensification. Maximizing their effectiveness is a key policy challenge. Monitoring is essential to inform adaptation and improvement of schemes over time, and to understand how measures may need to vary across a species’ range. 2. We measured changes in breeding abundance of a severely declining bird, the corn bunting Emberiza calandra, in response to AES in Scotland over 7 years and 71 farms. Two AES were monitored, one with general management for farmland birds, and one with targeted, adaptive management for corn buntings. We use these data to estimate the proportion of the population that AES must influence to halt the overall decline. 3. Corn buntings increased by 5·6% per annum on farms in the targeted AES, showed no significant change on farms in the general AES, and declined by 14·5% per annum on farms outside AES. 4. In arable-dominated areas, AES management that increased food availability reversed population declines. However, where a high proportion of corn buntings nested in grasslands, an additional AES option that delayed mowing was essential to achieving population increase. 5. Results suggest that approximately 72% of the corn bunting population in mainland Scotland must receive targeted AES management to halt the current decline. In 2009, only 24% was targeted in this way. 6. Synthesis and applications. AES measures are capable of reversing corn bunting declines in Scotland, and the same measures are likely to benefit a wide range of other taxa too, but require geographical targeting and flexibility to adapt and improve management options, backed by expert advice. Targeted AES provision to the required level for corn buntings will cost approximately £120 000 per annum, with 500–600 ha under appropriate management. This is 0·02% of annual subsidies paid to Scottish farmers, and 0·5% of land in the remaining mainland range of the corn bunting. These outcomes illustrate the value of AES monitoring studies to assess scheme effectiveness, identify improvements, and determine the scale of implementation required for reversing species declines.","Population growth,Population,Emberizidae,Emberiza,Ecology,Corn bunting,Biology,Biodiversity,Agriculture,Adaptive management,Psychology,Mixed model,Data mining,Wildlife conservation,Species richness,Landscape-scale conservation,Vegetation,Umbrella species,Measurement of biodiversity,Vulnerability,Urban planning,Resource management,Population,Guiding Principles,Environmental resource management,Pollinator,Nectar,Foraging,Set-aside,Population decline,Population,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,European union,Protected area,Metapopulation,Integrated farming,Wildlife conservation,Threatened species,Emberizidae","Allan J.

The case of coffee marketing in Costa Rica1,2007-01-01,Agricultural Economics,10.1111/J.1574-0862.2007.00270.X,"Historically low prices in the conventional coffee market have caused financial and social hardship among coffee farmers. In the face of this crisis, specialty markets have attracted the attention of the international donor community. These market segments have shown consistent growth over the last decade and exhibit price premiums in international markets. Therefore, if higher prices are passed on to farmers, access to specialty markets could help to alleviate the crisis brought on by low prices in the conventional sector. The present study attempts to identify the factors that determine farmers' participation in specialized markets and whether participation in these markets leads to higher prices for farmers. A two-stage model is used to analyze farmers' marketing decisions and their effect on the prices received. This procedure allows us to control for the endogeneity bias introduced by the marketing choice. Our results indicate that farmers participating in the specialty coffee segment do in fact receive higher prices than those participating in conventional channels. Additionally, we find that participation in cooperatives has a positive impact on the probability that a farmer chooses to grow specialty coffee and analogously on the prices that they receive. Based on these results, it seems that efforts to increase participation in the specialty coffee segment and in cooperatives would help to lessen some of the hardships brought on by low prices in the conventional coffee sector.

213,The effect of using consumption taxes on foods to promote climate friendly diets – The case of Denmark,2013-01-01,Food Policy,10.1016/J.FOODPOL.2012.12.004,"Agriculture is responsible for 17–35% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions with livestock production contributing by approximately 18–22% of global emissions. Due to high monitoring costs and low technical potential for emission reductions, a tax on consumption may be a more efficient policy instrument to decrease emissions from agriculture than a tax based directly on emissions from production. In this study, we look at the effect of internalising the social costs of greenhouse gas emissions through a tax based on CO2 equivalents for 23 different foods. Furthermore, we compare the loss in consumer surplus and the changed dietary composition for different taxation scenarios. In the most efficient scenario, we find a decrease in the carbon footprint from foods for an average household of 2.3–8.8% at a cost of 0.15–1.73DKK per kg CO2 equivalent whereas the most effective scenario led to a decrease in the carbon footprint of 10.4–19.4%, but at a cost of 3.53–6.90DKK per kg CO2 equivalent. The derived consequences for health show that scenarios where consumers are not compensated for the increase in taxation level lead to a decrease in the total daily amount of kJ consumed, whereas scenarios where the consumers are compensated lead to an increase. Most scenarios lead to a decrease in the consumption of saturated fat. Compensated scenarios leads to an increase in the consumption of added sugar, whereas uncompensated scenarios lead to almost no change or a decrease. Generally, the results show a low cost potential for using consumption taxes to promote climate friendly diets.","Saturated fat,Greenhouse gas,Economics,Economic surplus,Dietary composition,Consumption tax,Carbon footprint,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Added sugar,Runaway climate change,Physical science,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report,Medicine,Environmental health,Diet+nutrition,Stern Review,Social discount rate,Market place,Physical activity,Medicine,Environmental health,Water scarcity,Water resources,Livestock,Virology,Physical activity,Medicine,Statistics,Percentile,Mode (statistics),Surgery,Red meat,Malnutrition,Land use,Land cover,Greenhouse gas,Surgery,Sudden death,Risk of mortality","Louise Dyhr Edjabou,Sinne Smed,Jonathan Gregory,Ronald J.

By conducting face-to-face interviews and using questionnaires, the structure of Aydin dairy plants’ food safety management systems was characterized. The questionnaires elicited information about the applications of food safety systems, dairy plant managers’ opinions about any inspection systems, and their expectations for government and local legal authorities in food safety systems. Twenty-eight operating dairy plants in Aydin with a production licence from the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock show activity in the sector for more than 10 years (53.5%) with joint-stock or limited company status (60.7%). These plants produce white cheese, fermented milk products and butter. Implementing a clear and efficient food safety management system can improve legal issues (85.7%) and increase client trust (64.3%). This is positively correlated with the ages of dairy plant managers in the dairy industry in Aydin ( p p A lack of knowledge relating to and the cost of HACCP and other food safety programs were the main barriers to implementation in the Aydin dairy industry.

SWOT analysis is a technique used to analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of businesses. In all countries, farming practices play a vital role in food security. Population growth is the major reason for increased food demands and it puts additional pressure on the natural resource. Countries with rapid population growth face especially difficult challenges in ensuring food security. As such, SWOT analysis is used to identify strategies for agricultural development, especially in farming systems, and they help the researchers or planners to manage and prioritize them for achieving food security. The research area was located in rural areas of Shadervan district, Shouahtar Township, Iran, and the study's population comprised wheat farmers (N=1950). The sample size (n=165) was selected by random sampling. Based on the results of SWOT, strategies for farming system management were prioritized and they include: development of poor local market opportunities and infrastructure, planting of crops with high economic values, development of governmental supports, preparing strategic plans for development of organic farming, considering the quality of crops, considering farm sustainability indexes, using sustainable water resources management and development of extension programs based on farmers' needs.","Sustainability,Strategic planning,SWOT analysis,Population,Natural resource,Geography,Food security,Environmental resource management,Environmental planning,Context analysis,Agriculture,Strategic management,Process management,Business,Wildlife,Strategic planning,Population growth,Strategy implementation,Strategic planning,Strategic management,Tourist industry,Tourism geography,SWOT analysis","Ahmad Reza Ommani,Igor H.Ansoff,J.

Given the fuzzy nature of drought, the variable fuzzy set theory was applied to develop an Integrated Drought Index (IDI) combining meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural factors across the Yellow River basin in North China. The runoff and soil moisture were derived by driving the calibrated Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model with observed atmospheric forcing. Furthermore, the law of mutual change of quality and quantity was adopted to identify qualitative change points of annual IDI series in the Yellow River basin. The results indicate that: (1) the Integrated Drought Index (IDI) has a better performance compared with Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized streamflow Index (SSFI), and it is more sensitive and effective to capture drought onset and persistence, largely owing to its combination with the information of different drought-related variables; (2) spatially, the middle reaches has a higher drought risk than the rest portions of the Yellow River basin; seasonally, drought risk in spring and winter is larger than other seasons; overall, the IDI of the basin is dominated by an insignificantly downward trend; (3) some qualitative change points of drought were identified in the Yellow River basin, and those are primarily induced by ENSO events and the construction of dams and reservoirs. This study proposed an alternative drought indicator coupled with multivariate drought-related variables by objectively determining their weights based on the entropy weight method, which has a great value in characterizing drought.

However, ignoring variability and induced uncertainty of LCA results reduces their significance, especially when dealing with agricultural processes that present high natural fluctuations. The objective of the study was to explore the robustness of LCA results when accounting for variable emissions data, illustrated by the case of slurry application techniques. Four application techniques were compared: band spreading, broadcast spreading, harrowing after surface application and direct injection. On the basis of the normalisation results, acidification, eutrophication and global warming potentials were selected. To estimate field nitrogen emissions, an original approach was developed based on relative nitrogen loss factors for each technique from a literature review. The calculated field emissions from different soil and climate conditions were considered equally probable and were propagated into a range of LCA result using the Monte Carlo method. Injection and harrowing both showed reduced acidification and eutrophication potentials compared to band spreading and broadcast spreading but had larger global warming potentials, which could be particularly important with injection. Harrowing consequently appeared as the best compromise. Despite the large range of LCA results, robust conclusions could be drawn. To achieve a more refined comparison between the techniques, the use of process-based models in contrasted situations is suggested.","Slurry,Robustness (computer science),Monte Carlo method,Life-cycle assessment,Large range,Global warming,Environmental engineering,Economics,Climate change,Agriculture,Landfill gas utilization,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas accounting,Life-cycle assessment,Life cycle thinking,Life cycle inventory,Life-cycle assessment,Iso standards,Environmental science,Reactive nitrogen,Nitrogen,Environmental systems,Rye bread,Reliability engineering,Mean value,Life-cycle assessment,Environmental science,Environmental planning,Uncertainty analysis,Environmental resource management,Engineering,Organic farming,Life-cycle assessment,Land use,Slurry,Manure,Farmyard manure,Resource depletion,Natural resource economics,Life-cycle assessment","Brigitte Langevin,Claudine Basset-Mens,Laurent Lardon,K.

The case of Hortico Agrisystems illustrates the considerable challenges and costs faced by supermarket suppliers in sourcing from a broad base of small-scale producers in the context of evolving food safety and quality standards. While small-scale producers are able to achieve levels of compliance at least equal to those of large-scale producers, multi-tiered and dynamic systems of control are required to maintain control. These need to include measures that facilitate compliance, incentives to reward good performance and penalties to punish non-compliance. In establishing a sustainable supply system in this context, both exporters and small-scale producers face a steep learning curve in adjusting to new requirements, further emphasising the need for supply chains to be responsive to change.","Supply chain,Marketing,Learning curve,Insourcing,Industrial organization,Incentive,Food safety,Economics,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Spell,Rapid rise,Poverty,Quality management system,Labour economics,International relations,Safety standards,Retail trade,Retail sector,Transaction cost,Rural development,Market economy,Safety standards,Reputation,Private sector,Product market,Marketing,International trade,Sustainability,Socioeconomics,Market economy,Transaction cost,Reservation,Market development,Poverty,International development,Industrialisation,Social policy,Rural area,Poverty","Spencer Henson,Oliver Masakure,David Boselie,Thomas Reardon,Julio A.

222,Application of a groundwater quality index as an assessment and communication tool in agro-environmental policies – Two Portuguese case studies,2006-01-01,Journal of Hydrology,10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2005.12.001,"A simple methodology based on multivariate analysis is developed to create a groundwater quality index (GWQI) and a composition index (GWCI), with the aim of monitoring the joint influence of agriculture on several key parameters of groundwater chemistry and potability. The methodology is based on the definition of two standard water samples of high and low quality that, together with the actual data, are run through a statistical algorithm known as correspondence factor analysis. The applicability of the constructed indices as an assessment and communication tool is evaluated in two case studies in the south of Portugal. Index maps are created, providing a comprehensive picture of the contamination problem and easily interpretable for people outside the scientific domain. Such maps could be particularly useful in agro-environmental policies such as Nitrates Directive 91/676/EEC. Drawn up in order to reduce the environmental load of nutrients from agriculture, its implementation continues to be very problematic in most EU member states. In the case studies, the GWQI maps reveal that groundwater quality in the upper aquifers is extremely low, with an almost complete absence of potable water. However, the impact of agricultural activity on the groundwater composition shows a large spatial variability, which is accurately depicted by the GWCI maps and mainly related to crop type and aquifer lithology. In addition, contamination-freshening sequences occur and are displaced by groundwater flow, partly affected by faults that form either preferential flow paths or flow barriers.","Water quality,Spatial variability,Pollution,Land use,Hydrology,Groundwater flow,Groundwater,Geology,Aquifer,Agriculture,Vulnerability assessment,Vadose zone,Nitrate,Water quality,Water pollution,Surface water,Water resource management,Environmental science,Water quality,Total organic carbon,Radon,Water column,Surface runoff,Sediment,Statistics,Statistical analysis,Normal distribution,Water balance,Return flow,Irrigation,Nutrient pollution,Nutrient management,Gross margin,Weighting,Water quality,Surface water quality,Water quality,Soil test,Lithology","T.Y.

Yet policies to address this issue remain underexplored in the literature. This article first reviews the agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution policy literature and categorizes its major findings. The North American literature, in particular, rarely analyses NPS policies already in force, and pays even less attention to overcoming implementation barriers to reaching desired environmental outcomes. Second, this paper evaluates a newly adopted policy approach that addresses nonpoint sources of nutrient contaminants in the surface waters of one of the United States’ most agriculturally productive and environmentally pristine areas, California's Central Coast. The article then reveals the political, budgetary and technical barriers faced by farmers, regulators, and other stakeholders. The article concludes by arguing that more analyses of implemented policies designed to address agricultural NPS pollution will better inform both local-level and federal policymakers towards the successful creation and implementation of policies that achieve environmental outcomes.","Water quality,Water pollution,Surface runoff,Pollution,Politics,Nonpoint source pollution,Environmental protection,Environmental planning,Cultural practice,Biology,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Surface runoff,Nonpoint source pollution,Manure,Technological revolution,Public sector,Public administration,Soil horizon,Plough,Pasture,Water pollution,Risk assessment,Pollution,Environmental science,Census,Agriculture,Water quality,Stream restoration,Riparian zone,Voluntary Program,Public economics,Microeconomics,Policy design,Nonpoint source pollution,Natural resource economics,Wildlife,Sustainable agriculture,Spite,Twenty-First Century,Public policy,Public administration","Brian M.

Whilst this grazed pasture farming system is very efficient at producing milk, it has also been identified as a significant source of nutrients (N and P) and faecal bacteria which have contributed to water quality degradation in some rivers and lakes. In response to these concerns, a tool-box of mitigation measures that farmers can apply on farm to reduce environmental emissions has been developed. Here we report the potential reduction in nutrient losses and costs to farm businesses arising from the implementation of individual best management practices (BMPs) within this tool-box. Modelling analysis was carried out for a range of BMPs targeting pollutant source reduction on case-study dairy farms, located in four contrasting catchments. Due to the contrasting physical resources and management systems present in the four dairy catchments evaluated, the effectiveness and costs of BMPs varied. Farm managements that optimised soil Olsen P levels or used nitrification inhibitors were observed to result in win–win outcomes whereby nutrient losses were consistently reduced and farm profitability was increased in three of the four case study farming systems. Other BMPs generally reduced nutrient and faecal bacteria losses but at a small cost to the farm business. Our analysis indicates that there are a range of technological measures that can deliver substantial reductions in nutrient losses to waterways from dairy farms, whilst not increasing or even reducing other environmental impacts (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions and energy use). Their implementation will first require clearly defined environmental goals for the catchment/water body that is to be protected. Secondly, given that the major sources of water pollutants often differed between catchments, it is important that BMPs are matched to the physical resources and management systems of the existing farm businesses.","Water quality,Waste management,Temperate climate,Source reduction,Pollutant,Nutrient,Greenhouse gas,Dairy farming,Chemistry,Agriculture,Trifolium repens,Pasture,Nitrification,Trifolium repens,Nitrogen cycle,Nitrogen balance,Trifolium repens,Pasture,Nitrous oxide,Water quality,STREAMS,Nutrient,Soil water,Soil science,Plough,Water quality,Phosphorus,Pasture,Stocking,Soil quality,Pasture,Pasture,Nitrous oxide,Nitrate,Urea,Trifolium repens,Soil science,Water quality,Turbidity,Suspended solids","R.M.

225,Transforming exploitative land-based economy: The case of Borneo,2020-01-01,Environmental development,10.1016/J.ENVDEV.2019.100487,"Abstract Large-scale land exploitation to jumpstart backward economies is often accompanied by massive environmental impacts. The broad concepts of productivity-oriented ‘bio-economy’ and conservation-oriented ‘eco-economy’ were proposed to transform exploitative land-based economies. Taking cases in Borneo as core examples, this paper explores 10 transformative strategies for sustainability: boosting upstream productivity of cash crops, activating under-utilised low carbon (ULC) land for production, upgrading and diversifying downstream activities, branding for more values (industrial), establishing new domestic demand for bio-resources, creating values for carbon and ecosystem services, enhancing agro-ecological resilience, establishing eco-based tertiary sectors, branding for more values (smallholders), and encouraging self-sufficient farming. Generally, utility-based development strategies with wealth creation as the centre of policymaking are inadequate to repair the previous environmental damage. Likewise, strategies that prioritise restoration have shown a limited contribution to economic growth as observed in the case of Borneo. The interconnected nature of economic productivity and conservation means that no single strategy is a perfect solution but a combination of them may produce a better outcome. While integrated landscape analysis that combines land-use models and economic analyses can facilitate understanding of the systems, in-depth area studies are necessary to capture the more subtle ‘human factors’ like socio-political dynamics. The existence of multiple stakeholders with different interests and values means that an ‘optimal’ combination would be a result of political negotiations rather than scientific investigations. To design and also effectively execute the strategies, communication, collaboration and co-production of knowledge between scientific communities and various stakeholders is imperative.","Sustainability,Psychological resilience,Negotiation,Land use,Ecosystem services,Economy,Cash crop,Business,Agriculture,Agricultural land,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Greenhouse gas,Food systems,Sustainable livelihood,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Rural sociology,Valorisation,Organic chemistry,Levulinic acid,Sustainable development,Public economics,Payment,Sustainability,Stakeholder,Panacea (medicine),Sowing,Plant breeding,Palm kernel oil,Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation,Public policy,Intact forest landscape,Wilderness area,Sustainable development,Population,Landscape ecology,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Intact forest landscape","Chun Sheng Goh,Millenium Ecosystem Assessment,Tara Garnett,M.C.

226,"Quantification of the Impact of Land-Use Changes on Ecosystem Services: A Case Study in Pingbian County, China",2007-01-01,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,10.1007/S10661-006-9344-0,"Pingbian Miao Autonomous County is one of the poorest rural areas in China. Land-use changes, mainly driven by agricultural expansion and deforestation, may significantly impact ecosystem services and functions, but such effects are difficult to quantify. In the present study, Landsat image data were combined with the published coefficients about the world and China ecosystem to quantify land-use and ecosystem service changes in the mountainous area. A sensitivity analysis was employed to determine the effect of manipulating these coefficients on the estimated values. Our results show that during the past decades (from 1973 to 2004) forests and grasslands were converted into shrubland and cropland, respectively, resulting in a continuous decrease in ecosystem service (from 124.5 US$ × 106 in 1973 to 100.4 US$ × 106 in 2004). We found that the decrease of mixed forest in the study area was the largest contributor (i.e., 25.4 US$ × 106) to the decline of the ecosystem service. Therefore we propose that future land-use policy should pay more attention to the crucial ecosystem functions of these forests (including tropical forest), and that it is necessary to balance the relationship between the livelihood of local farmers and environmental protection in order to maintain a healthy and stable ecosystem.","Shrubland,Livelihood,Land use,Environmental protection,Environmental monitoring,Environmental engineering,Ecosystem services,Ecosystem,Deforestation,Chemistry,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Population,Nitrogen cycle,Global change,Valuation (finance),Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Need to know,Natural resource management,Environmental resource management,Total economic value,Stock (geology),Natural resource economics,Valuation (finance),Measurement of biodiversity,Environmental studies,Valuation (finance),Non-timber forest product,Geography,Urban sprawl,Rangeland,Metropolitan area,Sustainability,Satellite imagery,Per capita,Rainforest,Logging,Human overpopulation","Ren-Qiang Li,Ming Dong,Jian-Yong Cui,Li Li Zhang,Qing-Guo Cui,Wei-Ming He,Robert Costanza,Rudolf de Groot,Stephen Farberk,Monica Grasso,Bruce Hannon,Peter M.

In part this is because the data available do not permit adequate treatment of econometric issues that arise in such an assessment. This paper attempts to estimate the impact of the introduction of a minimum wage law within the Agriculture sector in South Africa, based on 15 waves of the biannual Labour Force Survey (LFS), starting in September 2000 and ending in September 2007. The chosen sample includes six waves before the legislations effective date (March 2003) and nine afterwards. All 15 waves are pooled and treated as repeated cross sections over time. In order to assess whether the changes experienced by farm workers are unique, we identify a control group that has similar characteristics to the treatment group. Our econometric approach involves using two alternative specifications of a difference-in-differences model. We test whether employers reduced employment, and whether they responded at the intensive margin by reducing hours of work. The law also required non-wage benefits to be implemented, and we track the response here in the form of one such provision, namely that of a written contract. The results suggest a significant reduction in employment in Agriculture from the minimum wage, an increase in wages on average, no significant change in hours worked and a sharp rise in non-wage compliance.

However, official attitudes to urban agriculture vary considerably between and within different African countries. Recent field-based research undertaken in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, reveals that urban agriculture makes a significant contribution to the food basket of many urban households in the city. Despite this contribution, urban agriculture in Lusaka has remained a peripheral issue in urban development strategies and planning policy. Interviews with urban farmers and professionals from various government departments and non-governmental organisations indicate that urban agriculture suffers from a number of factors such as a shortage of land and unsupportive official policy. This paper attempts to illuminate the patterns, processes and decision-making strategies associated with the production of foodstuffs for sale and/or household consumption. The extent to which urban agriculture is being supported or marginalized in Lusaka is examined in the context of evolving strategies for achieving sustainable urban development, poverty alleviation and food security.","Urbanization,Urban planning,Urban agriculture,Poverty,Political science,Livelihood,Human geography,Government,Food security,Economic growth,Urban planning,Urban ecosystem,Urban agriculture,Urban agriculture,Unemployment,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Zoning,Sustainability,Northern nigeria,Urban planning,Urban agriculture,Threatened species,Sociology,Rural development,Rhetoric,Urbanization,Urban agriculture,Sustainability,Urban planning,Urban density,Urban agriculture,Water resource management,Irrigated agriculture,Geography,Urbanization,Urban agriculture,Social network,Urban structure,Urban planning,Urban design","Danny Mulala Simatele,Tony Binns,Jac Smit,Joe Nasr,Annu Ratta,R.

231,"Perspective: Understanding the Intersection of Climate/Environmental Change, Health, Agriculture, and Improved Nutrition - A Case Study: Type 2 Diabetes.",2019-01-01,Advances in Nutrition,10.1093/ADVANCES/NMZ035,": Efforts to promote health through improved diet and nutrition demand an appreciation of the nutritional ecology that accounts for the intersection of agriculture, food systems, health, disease and a changing environment. The complexity and implications of this ecology is exemplified by current trends and efforts to address nutrition-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs), most prominently type 2 diabetes. The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to rise unabated. Of particular concern is how to address the unhealthy dietary patterns that are contributing to this pandemic in a changing environment. A multi- disciplinary approach is required that will engage those communities that comprise the continuum of effort from research to translation and implementation of evidence-informed interventions, programs and policies. Using the prevention of type 2 diabetes by increasing fruit and vegetable consumption as an exemplar, we argue that the ability to effect positive change in this and other persistent nutrition-related problems can be achieved by moving away from siloed approaches that limit the integration of key components of the diet-health continuum. Ultimately the impact of preventing type 2 diabetes via increased fruit and vegetable consumption will depend on how the entire diet changes, not just fruits and vegetables. In addition, the rapidly changing physical environment that will confront our food production system going forward will also shape the interventions that are possible. Nonetheless, the proposed ""team science"" approach that accounts for all the elements of the nutrition ecology will better position us to achieve public health goals through safe and sustainable food systems.","Sustainable agriculture,Public health,Public economics,Psychological intervention,Medicine,Internal medicine,Food systems,Food processing,Endocrinology,Disease,Discipline,Agriculture,Years of potential life lost,Verbal autopsy,Surgery,Sustainable agriculture,Surgery,Medicine,Urbanization,Sustainability,Public health,Population growth,Population,Crop yield,Stomatal conductance,Specific leaf area,RuBisCO,Zinc,Phytic acid,Nutrient,Surgery,Risk factor,Risk assessment,Transpiration,Terrestrial plant,Photosynthetic capacity,Stomatal conductance,Sink (computing),RuBisCO,Type 2 diabetes,Prospective cohort study,Pathology","John Finley,Lindsay M Jaacks,Christian J Peters,Donald R Ort,Haidong Wang,Mohsen Naghavi,Christine Allen,Ryan M.

232,The role of traditional farming practices in ecosystem conservation: The case of transhumance and vultures,2009-01-01,Biological Conservation,10.1016/J.BIOCON.2009.03.024,"Transhumance is a traditional livestock practice based on the movement of livestock between winter and summer pastures with importance placed on biodiversity conservation. We analyzed the transhumant activity of sheep and cows in the uplands of the Cantabrian Mountains, NW Spain, and its influence on the ecology and management of the griffon vulture, a scavenger with a relevant ecosystem function. For the first time, we provided strong evidence of the close relationship between vultures and transhumance, which was previously only suggested. Vultures occupied roosting sites very close to the summer pastures and often consumed livestock carcasses. There was a strong spatiotemporal adjustment in the use of these mountain areas by transhumant livestock, especially sheep, and vultures. The number of transhumant sheep and cows within 10–12.5 km around the roosts were the best predictors of vulture occurrence and abundance, respectively, in generalized linear mixed models. Our estimates of potentially available food from livestock carcasses for vultures indicated that our study area can maintain important griffon vulture populations through a system based on traditional livestock farming including transhumance. Thus, transhumance is able to influence the top of the ecosystem (scavengers) and could aid in sustainable management of griffon vulture populations. In our study area, transhumant sheep were reduced by 62% in the last 15 years and only 20% of summer pastures are now occupied. The potential impact that the ongoing loss of transhumant activity could have on mountain ecosystem conservation should be assessed and taken into account by the new European Common Agricultural Policy.","Vulture,Predation,Livestock,Gyps fulvus,Ecosystem,Ecology,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Accipitridae,Statistical theory,Statistical inference,Model selection,Population,Nitrogen cycle,Global change,Solidarity,Socioeconomics,Political economy of climate change,Natural resource economics,Land use,European union,Seed dispersal,Pollination,Omnivore,Quasi-likelihood,Probability distribution,Overdispersion,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Vulture,Visceral gout,Veterinary medicine,Watershed,Knowledge base,Environmental resource management,Vulture,Visceral gout,Veterinary medicine","Pedro P.

Five sectors were considered, including the agricultural, industrial, transportation, commercial and other sectors. An industrial sub-sector decomposition analysis was further performed in the six high-emission industrial branches. The results show that, for all five sectors in Tianjin, economic growth was the most important factor driving the increase in emissions, while energy efficiency improvements were primarily responsible for the decrease in emissions. In comparison, the influences from energy mix shift and emission coefficient changes were relatively marginal. The disaggregated decomposition in the industry further revealed that energy efficiency improvement has been widely achieved in the industrial branches, which was especially true for the Smelting and Pressing of Ferrous Metals and Chemical Raw Materials and Chemical Products sub-sectors. However, the energy efficiency declined in a few branches, e.g., Petroleum Processing and Coking Products. Moreover, the increased emissions related to industrial structure shift were primarily due to the expansion of Smelting and Pressing of Ferrous Metals; its share in the total industry output increased from 5.62% to 16.1% during the examined period.","Waste management,Smelting,Raw material,Greenhouse gas,Environmental engineering,Engineering,Energy mix,Efficient energy use,Decomposition analysis,China,Agriculture,Price index,Operations management,Management science,Trade barrier,Kyoto Protocol,International trade,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report,HadCM3,Environmental science,Mathematical economics,Logarithmic mean,Kaya identity,Operations research,Kaya identity,Environmental studies,Kyoto Protocol,Intermediate consumption,Greenhouse gas,Urban area,Population,Natural resource economics,Thermodynamics,Residual,New energy,Urban studies,Power station,Natural resource economics,Thermodynamics,Mathematical optimization,Kaya identity","Jidong Kang,Tao Zhao,Nan Liu,Xin Zhang,Xianshuo Xu,Tao Lin,B.W Ang,Glen P.

In this study, we selected areas with typical agricultural nitrate pollution in northeast China as study sites. We then collected groundwater samples for nitrate nitrogen content analysis using the Four Step method developed by the United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in conjunction with the non-carcinogens health risk model (R = CDI/RfD) to determine the health risk associated with nitrate pollution of groundwater. The reference value of nitrates in drinking water was set at 10 mg/L (measured as nitrogen) and the intake reference dose of nitrate was set at 1.6 mg•kg−1•d−1 based on the EPA’s IRIS(Integrated Risk Information System). The water intake reference values were set at 2.3 L/d and 1.5 L/d based on the EPA values and actual values observed in the study area. The average exposure time was the ED (exposure duration) × 365d/a. Weights refer to the 2002 national urban and rural average weight of residents of different genders and different ages. Health hazard index calculation was based on the above information, and the index less than 1 is acceptable (U.S. EPA’s Risk Assessment Guide). Health risk assessment maps were then drawn by Arcgis software.

Often, farmland is still removed from agricultural reserves for the ‘good of society’ (for example, creating industrial parks). In 2008, an action research project was initiated to attempt to reduce agricultural vulnerability in several peri-urban and rural areas near Montreal by emphasising the importance of the appropriation of the value of these farmlands by non-farm citizens and actors. The action research roles involved accompanying the farmers, facilitating meetings, mobilising non-farm actors, and informing farmers of possibilities when asked to do so. In this article, one specific project is analysed in Senneville (in the west of Montreal Island). While the project was initiated by the farmers to guarantee their long-term future, they also sought to involve other, mostly non-agricultural, actors. In a colloquium, a collective vision for the project was constructed, integrating other functions of farmland such as conservation and leisure activities. Many meetings were organised over a three-year period and formal presentations were made to the municipality. The project is ongoing, including new farm operations and the reinforcement of local markets for marketing mainly organic produce. The area is now an integral part of an emerging ‘green belt’ of the Montreal agglomeration and is already part of a ‘green coalition’ of both urban and peri-urban actors (farmers and non-farmers), and an emerging food system movement which represents a more holistic approach to food production.","Vulnerability,Urban agriculture,Rural area,Peri-urban agriculture,Green belt,Geomorphology,Geography,Food systems,Environmental protection,Environmental planning,Agriculture,Action research,Social psychology,Psychology,Action research,Land-use planning,Land use,Human geography,Urbanization,Urban planning,Structural change","Christopher Robin Bryant,Ghalia Chahine,Kurt Lewin,C R Bryant,L H Russwurm,C.

For example, priorities in many lowland floodplains in England have changed in recent years from a focus on agricultural production towards environmental quality and the management of flood risk, in part linked to climate change. Recent concerns about food security, however, may reinstate the importance of agricultural production in these fertile areas. This paper explores changes in rural land use in floodplains by measuring the range of ecosystem services provided under different management scenarios. Generic land use scenarios consider management options that focus on single objectives, such as maximising agricultural production, maximising biodiversity and maximising flood storage capacity. Indicators are developed to value the ecosystem services provided by floodplains under each scenario, identifying potential synergy and conflict. This integrated ecosystems approach can help to inform future policy and practice for floodplain management, hopefully in ways that appeal to key stakeholders.","Land use,Land management,Goods and services,Food security,Environmental resource management,Environmental quality,Ecosystem services,Economics,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Impact factor,Human welfare,Environmental resource management,Valuation (finance),Typology,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Well-being,The Conceptual Framework,Poverty,Recreation,Measurement of biodiversity,Human Dimension,Geomorphology,Geology,Fluvial landforms of streams,Total human ecosystem,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Environmental resource management,Total human ecosystem,Land use,Land management,Valuation (finance),Natural resource,Natural capital,Valuation (finance),Public policy,Environmental resource management","H.

The levels of knowledge and awareness of the dangers to the environment and human health were investigated by questionnaires for farmers (209) and retailers (20) in two rural regions (Qianyang County (S1) and Chencang County (S2)) of the Wei River catchment in China where the modes of farming and the state of erosion are very different. The results showed that farmers learned the use and dangers of pesticides mainly by oral communication (p   70%) was the most common mode of personal hygiene, relative to wearing masks, showering, and changing clothes, but no significant differences were observed between the selected regions. Most pesticide wastes were dumped directly onto the land or into water, suggesting that educational measures should be taken to address the potential risks from the residues in the wastes. Over 85% of farmers (S1 and S2) claimed to use illegal pesticides, but the reasons for their use varied (p < 0.01). Retailers were well-informed and highly conscious of their responsibility for the safe use of pesticides, especially in S2 (p < 0.01). A canonical correspondence analysis indicated that educational level and age differed between the two regions and contributed greatly to the risks from pesticide use (p < 0.01). Educational programmes targeted to age groups, proper disposal of pesticide waste, and sufficient supervision from authorities should consequently be considered for improving the levels of knowledge and awareness of the dangers of pesticides to human health and environmental pollution in the Wei River catchment, China.","Risk perception,Poison control,Pesticide,Personal hygiene,Environmental pollution,Environmental engineering,Developing country,Chemistry,Agriculture,Agricultural pollution,Surgery,Suicide prevention,Suicide attempt,Wildlife,Sustainable development,Pesticide,Sri lanka,Rural area,Physical therapy,Research system,Pesticide use,Pesticide,Threatened species,Population,Pollution,Tanzania,Pesticide use,Pesticide application,Social isolation,Pesticide,Medicine,Population,Pesticide application,Pesticide,Poison control,Pesticide misuse,Pesticide,Suicide prevention,Poison control,Pesticide","Xiaomei Yang,Fei Wang,Lei Meng,Wenshuai Zhang,Michael R Phillips,Gonghuan Yang,Yanping Zhang,Lijun Wang,Huiyu Ji,David Pimentel,David Gunnell,Michael Eddleston,Jikun Huang,Ruifa Hu,Carl Pray,Fangbin Qiao,Scott Rozelle,WenJun Zhang,FuBin Jiang,JianFeng Ou,A.V.F.

240,Diet transformation in Africa: the case of Ethiopia,2017-01-01,Agricultural Economics,10.1111/AGEC.12387,"Africa's food systems are changing fast amid rapid economic growth, emerging urbanization, and structural transformation. In this study, we use four rounds of nationally representative data from Ethiopia to examine changes in household food consumption patterns over a period of unprecedented economic growth. We find that while there is a general decline in the share of food in the total consumption basket of households in Ethiopia, food quantities and intake of calories have increased considerably over the period 1996 to 2011. This was mostly driven by improvements in household incomes, as shown using decomposition analysis. Furthermore, the content of the food basket is changing with a gradual shift towards high-value foods, such as animal products, fruits and vegetables, and processed foods. However, irrespective of the level of income, a heavy focus on starchy staples in the Ethiopian diet remains. Overall, this diet transformation has important implications for the food security debate and for agricultural and food policy in the country.","Urbanization,Structural transformation,Food systems,Food security,Food processing,Food policy,Economics,Calorie,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Rural area,Physical activity,Pandemic,Rapid rise,Procurement,Latin Americans,Spite,Socioeconomic status,Relative price,Wage,Statistics,Standard error,Statistics,Statistic,Quantile,Statistics,Segmented regression,Regression diagnostic,Socioeconomic status,Overweight,Obesity,Per capita,Globalization,Food systems,Normal good,Necessity good,Microeconomics,Urbanization,Obesity,Nutrition transition","Ibrahim Hassen Worku,Mekdim Dereje,Bart Minten,Kalle Hirvonen,Barry M Popkin,Linda S Adair,Shu Wen Ng,Thomas Reardon,C.

241,"Modeling impacts of farming management alternatives on CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions: A case study for water management of rice agriculture of China",2005-01-01,Global Biogeochemical Cycles,10.1029/2004GB002341,"[1] Since the early 1980s, water management of rice paddies in China has changed substantially, with midseason drainage gradually replacing continuous flooding. This has provided an opportunity to estimate how a management alternative impacts greenhouse gas emissions at a large regional scale. We integrated a process-based model, DNDC, with a GIS database of paddy area, soil properties, and management factors. We simulated soil carbon sequestration (or net CO2 emission) and CH4 and N2O emissions from China's rice paddies (30 million ha), based on 1990 climate and management conditions, with two water management scenarios: continuous flooding and midseason drainage. The results indicated that this change in water management has reduced aggregate CH4 emissions about 40%, or 5 Tg CH4 yr−1, roughly 5–10% of total global methane emissions from rice paddies. The mitigating effect of midseason drainage on CH4 flux was highly uneven across the country; the highest flux reductions (>200 kg CH4-C ha−1 yr−1) were in Hainan, Sichuan, Hubei, and Guangdong provinces, with warmer weather and multiple-cropping rice systems. The smallest flux reductions ( 8.0 kg N/ha) in Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang provinces, where the paddy soils contained relatively high organic matter. Shifting water management from continuous flooding to midseason drainage reduced total net CO2 emissions by 0.65 Tg CO2-C yr−1, which made a relatively small contribution to the net climate impact due to the low radiative potential of CO2. The change in water management had very different effects on net greenhouse gas mitigation when implemented across climatic zones, soil types, or cropping systems. Maximum CH4 reductions and minimum N2O increases were obtained when the mid-season draining was applied to rice paddies with warm weather, high soil clay content, and low soil organic matter content, for example, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, which have 60% of China's rice paddies and produce 65% of China's rice harvest.","Soil water,Soil organic matter,Soil classification,Paddy field,Hydraulic engineering,Greenhouse gas,Geology,Environmental protection,Drainage,Agriculture","Changsheng Li,Steve Frolking,Xiangming Xiao,Berrien Moore,Steve Boles,Jianjun Qiu,Yao Huang,William Salas,Ronald Sass",http://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1312&context=earthsci_facpub,186,agriculture case study greenhouse gas

The case for a Bronze Age agricultural revolution in the British Isles,2012-01-01,Antiquity,10.1017/S0003598X00047864,"This paper rewrites the early history of Britain, showing that while the cultivation of cereals arrived there in about 4000 cal BC, it did not last. Between 3300 and 1500 BC Britons became largely pastoral, reverting only with a major upsurge of agricultural activity in the Middle Bronze Age. This loss of interest in arable farming was accompanied by a decline in population, seen by the authors as having a climatic impetus. But they also point to this period as the time of construction of the great megalithic monuments, including Stonehenge. We are left wondering whether pastoralism was all that bad, and whether it was one intrusion after another that set the agenda on the island.","Population,Pastoralism,Megalith,Intrusion,History,Bronze Age,Archaeology,Arable land,Ancient history,Agriculture,Agricultural revolution,Reservoir effect,Radiocarbon dating,Multi proxy,Prehistory,History,Archaeology,Repartition,Radiocarbon dating,Prehistory,Radiocarbon dating,Population density,Population,Radiocarbon dating,Population,Mesolithic,Royaume uni,Radiocarbon dating,Prehistory,Western europe,Sociology,Population,North china,Mesoamerica,Loess,History,Bronze Age,Archaeology,Taphonomy,Human settlement,German","Chris J.

243,Wastewater irrigation in the developing world : Two case studies from the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal,2007-01-01,Agricultural Water Management,10.1016/J.AGWAT.2006.08.012,"Wastewater irrigation in the Kathmandu Valley is a widespread but poorly documented practice. This paper presents data from two case study sites, the Kirtipur and Bhaktapur municipalities of the Kathmandu Valley. An overview of existing urban wastewater disposal infrastructure, wastewater agriculture practices and quality of water used, the health implications of these practices and the level of institutional awareness of wastewater related issues are presented and compared with wastewater irrigation in other regions of the world where irrigation with wastewater is practiced. Data for the analyses on agricultural practices and health implications were obtained from a sample of 109 farmers using wastewater within the two municipalities. Bhaktapur typified direct utilization of wastewater by pumping from sewers whereas Kirtipur farmers used it indirectly by gravity flow from polluted rivers. Central to the discussion is that farmers here do not always choose to use wastewater but exploit its benefits when obliged to do so. Since the wastewater also changes the hydrology of the watercourse rendering it perennial, many farmers see the benefit of utilizing the resource. The negative attitude of some farmers towards wastewater stemmed from their inability to control wastewater application leading to flooding and loss of crops. The majority of farmers are well aware of negative health impacts particularly those related to skin infections, and they attempt to protect themselves through washing. No change in water quality can be expected without infrastructure investments and wastewater management changes, which are slow in coming due to the lack of institutional awareness about the complexity of the problem. Interaction amongst the various stakeholders through a formalized mechanism, to influence the disposal and reuse of wastewater is suggested.","Water quality,Wastewater,Sanitary sewer,Reuse,Irrigation,Hydrology,Hydraulic engineering,Flooding (psychology),Environmental protection,Environmental planning,Economics,Agriculture,Water supply,Water industry,Total suspended solids,World health,Wastewater,Technical report,Water resources,Water quality,Wastewater,Water resources,Water quality,Wastewater,Water source,Water resource management,Wastewater,Water resource management,Water quality,Wastewater,Who recommendations,Water resource management,Poultry manure,Water resources,Water resource management,Wastewater,Water resource management,Water quality,Wastewater,Water resource management,Water quality,Wastewater","Thomas Rutkowski,Liqa Raschid-Sally,Stephanie Buechler,A.E.

245,Rethinking the connections between agricultural change and rural prosperity: A discussion of insights derived from case studies in seven countries,2017-01-01,Journal of Rural Studies,10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2017.07.006,"Abstract In the past, rural prosperity has been mainly associated with the modernisation of agriculture and the economic benefits that appear to originate from it. Today we know that this simple logic is not correct in several respects. Regionally, structural changes to farms and the modernisation of a few farms have not always contributed to prosperous rural areas. At the level of farm households, we can see that other non-economic aspects such as a minimum level of autonomy, social recognition and social and environmental well-being all play rather significant roles. In this paper, we present an empirically grounded analysis of these questions based on in-depth case studies in seven countries (Spain, Italy, Lithuania, Latvia, Israel, Germany and Denmark). We discuss rural actors understanding of rural prosperity in different countries and contexts, the strategies used to improve prosperity and well-being, and how these strategies can be enabled and fostered. The empirical evidence presented indicates that prosperity in rural contexts is increasingly understood as being multi-dimensional and that people seek to balance economic parameters with human, social and environmental well-being.","Sustainability,Sociology,Rural management,Rural area,Prosperity,Modernization theory,Empirical evidence,Economic growth,Development economics,Autonomy,Agriculture,Prosperity,Post-growth,Political economy,Social worlds,Social psychology,Quantitative psychological research,Sustainable development,Rural sociology,Politics,Sustainable production,Sustainable economy,Sustainable consumption,Qualitative research,Public relations,Data science,Public economics,Poverty,Institutional quality,Urban sociology,Sociology,Social space,Social progress,Public economics,Neoclassical economics,Subjective well-being,Socioeconomics,Social psychology,Wage,Value systems,Sociology","Maria Rivera,Karlheinz Knickel,Ignacio de los Rios,Amit Ashkenazy,David Qvist Pears,Tzruya Chebach,Sandra Šūmane,Tim Jackson,Peter Senker,Ellie Fossey,Carol Harvey,Fiona Mcdermott,Larry Davidson,Jan Douwe van der Ploeg,Tim Jackson,Michael G.

We developed an ecological network model for the system, and used Beijing as an example of analysis based on the model. We used network throughflow analysis to determine the flows among components, and measured both indirect and direct flows. Using a network utility matrix, we determined the relationships and degrees of mutualism among six compartments – 1) local environment, 2) rainwater collection, 3) industry, 4) agriculture, 5) domestic sector, and 6) wastewater recycling – which represent producer, consumer, and reducer trophic levels. The capacity of producers to provide water for Beijing decreased from 2003 to 2007, and consumer demand for water decreased due to decreasing industrial and agricultural demand; the recycling capacity of reducers also improved, decreasing the discharge pressure on the environment. The ecological relationships associated with the local environment or the wastewater recycling sector changed little from 2003 to 2007. From 2003 to 2005, the main changes in the ecological relationships among components of Beijing's water metabolic system mostly occurred between the local environment, the industrial and agricultural sectors, and the domestic sector, but by 2006 and 2007, the major change was between the local environment, the agricultural sector, and the industrial sector. The other ecological relationships did not change during the study period. Although Beijing's mutualism indices remained generally stable, the ecological relationships among compartments changed greatly. Our analysis revealed ways to further optimize this system and the relationships among compartments, thereby optimizing future urban water resources development.","Water supply,Water resources,Secondary sector of the economy,Rainwater harvesting,Environmental engineering,Ecological relationship,Ecological network,Chemistry,Beijing,Agriculture,The Internet,Structure and function,Social network,Water use,Resource depletion,Natural resource,Water supply,Urban water,Urban area,Trophic level,Taxon,Simulation modeling,Urban metabolism,Urban area,Non-renewable resource,Tracing,Natural ecosystem,Model material,Urban metabolism,Urban area,Network utility,Unobservable,Trophic level,Mutualism (biology),Software,Quantitative methodology,Operations research,Sense of coherence,Mathematical economics,Leontief model","Yan Zhang,Zhifeng Yang,Brian D.

Nevertheless out of fifty-one gasification plants in the world, only thirty-one of them are equipped with systems for the partial recovery of the available energy. At the moment most of these plants mainly produce electric energy; however the employment of the cold energy results very interesting, in fact, it can be recovered for agro-food transformation and conservation as well as for some loops in the cold chain. Cold energy at low temperatures requires high amounts of mechanical energy and it unavoidably increases as the required temperature diminishes. Cold energy recovery from LNG gasification would allow considerable energy and economic savings to these applications, as well as environmental benefits due to the reduction of climate-changing gas emissions. The task of this work is to assess the possibility to create around a gasification plant an industrial site for firms working on the transformation and conservation of agro-food products locally grown. The cold energy recovered from gasification would be distributed to those firms through an opportune liquid carbon dioxide network distribution capable of supplying “the cold” to the different facilities. A LNG gasification plant in a highly agricultural zone in Sicily would increase the worth of the agro-food production, lower transformation and conservation costs when compared to the traditional systems and bring economic and environmental benefits to the interested areas.","Waste management,Mechanical energy,Liquefied natural gas,Greenhouse gas,Environmental impact of the energy industry,Engineering,Energy recovery,Cold chain,Available energy,Agriculture,Waste management,Regasification,Power station,Waste management,Thermodynamics,Thermodynamic cycle,Waste management,Turbine,Thermodynamics,Waste management,Thermodynamics,Thermodynamic cycle,Waste management,Waste heat recovery unit,Thermodynamics,Waste management,Natural gas,Liquefied natural gas,Supply and demand,Natural resource economics,Natural gas,Waste management,Terminal value,Revenue","Antonio Messineo,Giuseppe Panno,Celidonio Dispenza,Giorgio Dispenza,Vincenzo La Rocca,Giuseppe Panno,Wang Qiang,Li Yanzhong,Wang Jiang,Takahiko Miyazaki,Y.

In e-Sagu, the agricultural experts generate the expert advice based on the information about the crop situation received in the form of both text and digital photographs. In Kharif 2 2004, a prototype was developed and implemented with 1051 farms. In the prototype, a team of agricultural experts stayed at IIIT, Hyderabad (India) and delivered 20,000 pieces of agricultural expert advice to 1051 cotton farms of three villages (Oorugonda, Gudeppad and Oglapur) in Atmakur Mandal of Warangal district in Andhra Pradesh state, India, by looking at digital photographs and other farm information supplied by some educated and experienced farmers (coordinators) in these villages. The pilot project was implemented successfully. In this article, an analysis of 51 registered farmers’ regarding compliance of advices and corresponding effect is reported. The following of expert advice on pest and disease management and IPM practices were analyzed by giving appropriate scores based on their effect on yield and input cost. The analysis showed that about fifty percent of farmers have followed the practices which increase yield and reduce input cost. A high positive correlation (r=0.46**) was observed between the compliance rate and the yields. Though some farmers obtained same yield as the farmers who have followed the advices, their input costs were significantly higher.","Telugu,Operations management,Kharif crop,Information technology,Information gap,Expert advice,Business,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural extension,The Internet,Mass customization,Information technology,Web application,System a,Operations research","B.

However, most of the available studies concentrate on farm and farmer characteristics, failing to capture details of institutional arrangements between farmers and traders. Moreover, farmers’ preferences have rarely been considered. Here, we address these gaps by analyzing different market channels for sweet pepper in Thailand. Using data from a survey and choice experiment with farmers, we find that there is a general preference for marketing options that do not involve a contract. Additional provision of inputs and credit can increase the attractiveness of contracts. Yet, the most important factor for farmers is to personally know the buyer they deal with, which may be related to issues of trust.

Although in the past this new demand could often be met by tapping unclaimed water sources, this option is increasingly untenable in many regions where little if any unclaimed water remains. The result is that urban water capture, and the appropriation of associated physical and institutional infrastructure, now often implies conflict with other existing uses and users. While the urbanisation process has been studied in great depth, the processes and, critically, impacts of urban water capture and appropriation are not well researched or understood. This paper undertakes a critical examination of the specific case of Hyderabad, one of India’s fastest growing cities, to shed light more generally on the process of water capture by cities and the resultant impacts on pre-existing claims, particularly agriculture. It does this by examining the history and institutional response to Hyderabad’s urban–rural water contest; how the results of that contest are reflected in surface and groundwater hydrology; and the eventual impacts on agriculture. The findings show that the magnitude, and sometimes even direction, of impact from urban water transfer vary in space and time and depend on location-specific rainfall patterns, the nature of existing water infrastructure and institutions, and farmers’ adaptive capacities and options, notably recourse to groundwater.

252,Agricultural trade and virtual land use: The case of China's crop trade,2013-01-01,Land Use Policy,10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2012.12.017,"Trade liberalization has greatly accelerated the volume of traded agricultural products in past decades. As land resources become more limited in some countries, international trade plays an important role in compensating for land scarcity in these countries. This paper aims to measure and locate the virtual land use hidden in China's imports and exports, for both primary crops and processed products, from 1986 to 2009. The results show that as China's crop imports had grown greatly during the last decade, the net virtual land trade hidden in international trade had increased from -4.42 Mha in 1986 to 28.90 Mha in 2009. The main category of virtual land imports had changed from cereals to oil crops, which accounted for 82.2% of the total virtual land imports in 2009. Over the two decades the main source of virtual land imports had changed from North America to both South America and North America. International trade could also lower demand for land resources at the global level: our results showed that China's crop trade was contributing to global land savings by 3.27 Mha on annual average during 1986-2009. Economic development, and associated dietary changes and policy shifts were linked to the change of China's virtual land trade pattern. To make land use more sustainable at the global level, both importing and exporting countries of virtual land should consider ecological and socio-economic impacts of these trade flows in their policies.","Trade barrier,Land use,Land scarcity,Free trade,Economics,Crop,China,Annual average,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Tropics,Population growth,Geology,Water use,Water resources,Water resource management,Sustainability,Livestock,Greenhouse gas,Water use,Water resources,Virtual water,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Water resources,Urban economics,Natural capital,Global hectare,Socioeconomic development,Population growth,Population,Land use,Incentive,Government,Population,Land use,Geography,Water use,Water supply,Water resources","Wenli Qiang,Aimin Liu,Shengkui Cheng,Thomas Kastner,Ruth S.

It has been estimated that 20% of the water consumption and pollution in the world relates to the production of export goods. This study analyzes how French water resources are allocated over various purposes, and examines impacts of French production in local water resources. In addition, it analyzes the water dependency of French consumption and the sustainability of imports. The basins of the Loire, Seine, Garonne, and Escaut have been identified as priority basins where maize and industrial production are the dominant factors for the blue water scarcity. About 47% of the water footprint of French consumption is related to imported agricultural products. Cotton, sugar cane and rice are the three major crops that are identified as critical products in a number of severely water-scarce river basins: The basins of the Aral Sea and the Indus, Ganges, Guadalquivir, Guadiana, Tigris & Euphrates, Ebro, Mississippi and Murray rivers.

An economic assessment of the risk provides advantages for the identification of single hazards. Policy makers thus receive relevant information on the sectors and places at risk. This article provides an integrated spatial assessment of the flood risk for human beings and for the residential, non-residential, agricultural and environmental sectors. The methodology used is applied to the city of Zaragoza and downstream municipalities in the Ebro river basin (Spain). The analysis emphasises that flood-risk assessment must account for two measures of risk. The first is the expected annual damage, which is used to prioritise locations and sectors for prevention. The second comprises damage-probability curves, which provide information on the distribution of the risks, taking into account whether they originate from frequent floods with slight consequences or from exceptional floods with major consequences. The spatial assessment of risk reveals how the risk is distributed between upstream and downstream cities. This opens up a discussion on the issue of equity in flood risk-sharing in spatially integrated analysis.","Return period,Land use,Flood risk assessment,Flood myth,Equity (finance),Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Economics,Directive,Cultural heritage,Agriculture,Risk analysis (engineering),Risk analysis (business),Operations research,The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity,Political science,Mainstreaming,Water cycle,Mathematical model,Hydrology,Underpinning,Natural capital,Microeconomics,Loss of life,Land use,International literature,Vulnerability,Risk perception,Geography,Wetland,Valuation (finance),Returns to scale,Water depth,Impact assessment,Hydrology,Natural hazard,Land use,Hydrology,Wetland,Glossary,Environmental planning","S.

259,Eco-efficient approaches to land management: a case for increased integration of crop and animal production systems,2008-01-01,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B,10.1098/RSTB.2007.2167,"Eco-efficiency is concerned with the efficient and sustainable use of resources in farm production and land management. It can be increased either by altering the management of individual crop and livestock enterprises or by altering the land-use system. This paper concentrates on the effects of crop sequence and rotation on soil fertility and nutrient use efficiency. The potential importance of mixed farming involving both crops and livestock is stressed, particularly when the systems incorporate biological nitrogen fixation and manure recycling. There is, however, little evidence that the trend in developed countries to farm-level specialization is being reduced. In some circumstances legislation to restrict diffuse pollution may provide incentives for more diverse eco-efficient farming and in other circumstances price premia for produce from eco-efficient systems, such as organic farming, and subsidies for the provision of environmental services may provide economic incentives for the adoption of such systems. However, change is likely to be most rapid where the present systems lead to obvious reductions in the productive potential of the land, such as in areas experiencing salinization. In other situations, there is promise that eco-efficiency could be increased on an area-wide basis by the establishment of linkages between farms of contrasting type, particularly between specialist crop and livestock farms, with contracts for the transfer of manures and, to a lesser extent, feeds.","Sustainability,Organic farming,Nutrient management,Mixed farming,Land management,Environmental pollution,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Biology,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Organic farming,Intensive farming,Greenhouse gas,Strip farming,Soil quality,Population,Source water,Environmental science,Environmental engineering,Toxicology,Manure management,Manure,Productive capacity,Mixed farming,Manure,Topsoil,Tillage,Surface runoff,Zero Budget Farming,Organic farming,Environmental science,Nitrous oxide,Methane production,Methane,Trifolium repens,Red Clover,Medicago lupulina,Sediment,Phosphorus,Environmental engineering","R.J Wilkins,Tommy Dalgaard,Niels Halberg,John R.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the interaction and distribution of research and extension roles of public, private, and agricultural industry organizations in precision farming innovation systems. We connect findings to the broader debates on role divisions of public and private research and extension in innovation systems. Two case studies were examined: precision dairy farming in Australia, and the use of automatic milking systems in north-western Europe. A timeline analysis method, underpinned by a functions of innovation systems framework, was used to examine activities of actors and organizations in the case studies. Three main findings were: 1) Complex agricultural innovations require a collaborative approach for successful innovation and diffusion. The need for, and type of, collaboration differs across scales from farm-level (individual learning) to a national and global level with issues of skill training and service provider capability. Additionally, a threshold scale is required before the commercial sector can operate effectively. 2) The presence, and limitations, of private (commercial) interests and their position as a key knowledge base in precision farming heightens the need for public research and extension organizations to promote collaborative innovation programs with technology companies. There is a key public or industry good role in providing ‘back-office’ activities to support and complement private ‘front office’ activities. 3) Public and private research and extension organizations can work together, however there are areas where it makes more sense for one party or the other to lead. For precision farming systems, the roles for public organizations involve leadership on data integration (on-farm and off-farm), integration of technology (via standards), testing equipment performance, and development of training programs including support of initiatives such as farmer clubs. The principle theoretical implication is that public, private and industry roles in research and extension should not be viewed as dichotomous (e.g. pre-competitive/competitive), but as highly fluid in terms of the moments they are needed, and the scale at which they are needed, within the technological innovation system.","Timeline,Technological innovation system,Service provider,Precision agriculture,Knowledge management,Knowledge base,Front office,Environmental resource management,Economics,Economic growth,Data integration,Agriculture,Social research,Secondary research,Quantitative research,Technological innovation system,Technological change,Sustainable design,Technological innovation system,Policy analysis,Operationalization,Sustainability,Soil indicators,Sociology,Sociology,Social learning,Politics,Sociology,Sociological theory of diffusion,Product innovation,Unintended consequences,Technical progress,Sustainable development,Technological innovation system,Systemic problem,Sustainability,Technological innovation system,Technological change,Technical change,Technological innovation system,Technological change,Management science","C.

For areas experiencing fast expansion of urban and agriculture areas, land-use changes often adversely affect stream flow and water resources at the local and watershed scale. The Sekong, Sesan, and Srepok (3S) Sub-basins are a part of the Lower Mekong River Basin and include land in Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Laos), and Viet Nam. The region is experiencing a dynamic land-use transition because of rapid changes in its economy, society, and environment. Major land-use changes include deforestation of native rain forest, expansion of agricultural and urban areas, and expansion of commercial plantation such as rubber trees. These land-use alterations have affected local and regional hydrologic processes, resulting in stream flow shortages during the dry season and flash flooding due to deforestation. In this research, deforestation in the 3S Sub-basins over the period 1993–1997 was analyzed using multi-logistic regression. The regression analysis indicated that density of agricultural cells within a 5-km radius from each forest cell and slope strongly affected the deforestation process. A land-use forecast model to simulate deforestation and urbanization sites was developed in GIS based on local land-use change trends. The model was applied to 2003 land use to forecast 2033 land use and future water demand, which was further compared with present stream flow measurements during the dry season at various places in the region. The entire approach from the land-use forecast to its impact assessment on stream flow could help local stakeholders understand watershed-wide future water resources risks and develop future water resources plans. With the 3S Sub-basins being used as a case study area, this article presents a land-use forecast tool; simulated 2033 land-use and water demand; and the estimation of the impact of the forecasted future water demand on the local stream flow.","Water resources,Urbanization,Structural basin,Land use,Impact assessment,Flash flood,Environmental resource management,Economics,Deforestation,Agriculture,Software engineering,Software analytics,Reference software,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Sustainability research,Sustainability,Situated,Wetland,Riparian zone,Quantitative Evaluations,Vegetation,Remote sensing,Paddy field,Vegetation,Southeast asia,Natural rubber,Watershed,Water resources,Water balance,Poverty,Natural rubber,Hevea,Streamflow,Precipitation,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Statistics,Statistical analysis,Spatial variability","Masatsugu Takamatsu,Akiyuki Kawasaki,Peter P.

A decrease of rainfall and rise in temperature has been increasing the exposure of the country to frequent drought. The study was conducted in central Tigray, Adiha tabia, to examine the perception of farmers on trends of climate changes and existing coping strategies. Farmers’ knowledge of various adaptation strategies, drought early warning system and weather forecasting were assessed using focus group discussion (FGD), which consisted of 144 systematically sampled respondents. Temperature is rising while precipitation is declining from time to time. Untimely rain and frequent drought are challenging crop production in the area. Drought is perceived, both by male and female respondents, as the primary climate related hazard which is occurring frequently and affecting their livelihood. Individual’s vulnerability to this hazard varies based on their hazard coping capacity. Lack of modern early warning systems, inflexible cropping calendar and narrow choice of crop varieties should aggravates the vulnerability. Hence, improving forecasting and dissemination of climate information, developing drought resistant varieties and promoting farm-level adaptation measures like use of irrigation technologies and adjusting planting dates should be prioritized to improve community resilience to climate change.","Vulnerability,Socioeconomics,Livelihood,Global warming,Geography,Environmental resource management,Early warning system,Drought tolerance,Cropping,Climate change,Agriculture,Subsistence agriculture,Sharecropping,Incentive,Public policy,Micro level,Global environmental analysis,Staple food,Risk management,Political economy of climate change,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Somali,Trend analysis,Grassland,Environmental resource management,Vulnerability,Socioeconomics,Poverty,Vulnerability,Socioeconomics,Rainfed agriculture,Upside potential ratio,Risk management,Risk aversion,West african,West Africans,Sustainable agriculture,Water supply,Water sector,Irrigation","Dejene K.

After the publication of the European Commission's guidelines on coexistence in 2003, Portugal developed ex-ante regulatory and ex-post tort liability rules on the coexistence of GM and non-GM maize crops. There is an on-going debate on the extent to which the coexistence policies affect adoption. In this study we measure the costs and benefits of planting GM maize as a member of a cooperative. All group members achieved a higher gross margin by planting GM maize rather than non-GM maize on their farms. Group members did not face any ex-post liability costs and had zero ex-ante regulatory costs as they could easily internalize the ex-ante coexistence regulations. The results show that coexistence regulations such as informing neighbors or keeping minimum distances do not necessarily lead to increased production costs provided they are flexible enough.","Tort liability,Property rights,Liability,Gross margin,Economics,Cost–benefit analysis,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural policy,Agricultural economics,Tragedy of the commons,Tragedy of the anticommons,Natural resource,Worship,Trespass,Social control,Prison sentence,Member states,Liability,Pest control,Genetically modified organism,Food products,Negotiation,Natural resource economics,Minimum distance,Transaction cost,Safety regulation,Novel food,Welfare,Public economics,Proportionality (mathematics),Technical change,Per capita,Partial equilibrium,Technological change,Sowing,Portuguese,Mathematical economics,Genetically modified crops,Externality","Theodoros Skevas,Pedro Fevereiro,Justus Wesseler,Elinor Ostrom,Robert C.

In the present study, the occurrence, the bioavailability and the soil-to-crop transfer of heavy metals in farmland soils were investigated based on data from two agricultural areas, i.e. Sihui and Shunde in South China. Six heavy metals (As, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni and Pb) were quantified in the farmland soils. The mean single pollution level indices (PI) were all lower than 1 except for Hg in soils from Shunde (PI = 1.51 ± 0.46), suggesting the farmland soils were within clean and slightly polluted by heavy metals. As, Cu, Ni and Pb were found to be mostly present in the non-bioavailable form. The majority of Hg was considered potentially bioavailable, and Mn was found to be largely bioavailable. Soil pH was an important factor influencing bioavailability of soil-bound heavy metals. The concentrations of heavy metals in vegetables from Sihui and Shunde were within the food hygiene standards, while the rice grain from Sihui was polluted by Pb (PI = 10.3 ± 23.4). Total soil concentrations of heavy metals were not correlated to their corresponding crop concentrations, instead, significant correlations were observed for bioavailable concentrations in soil. The results supported the notion that the bioavailability of the investigated heavy metals in the soil was largely responsible for their crop uptake. The soil-to-crop transfer factors based on bioavailable concentrations suggested that Cu, As and Hg in soils of the study area had greater tendency to be accumulated in the vegetables than other heavy metals, calling for further human health assessment by consuming the contaminated crops.","Soil water,Soil pH,Pollution,Food chain,Environmental chemistry,Crop,Contamination,Chemistry,Bioavailability,Agriculture,Soil heavy metals,Soil contamination,Pollution,Zinc,Selenium,Mercury (element),Soil water,Soil contamination,Legume,Wastewater,Waste management,Monomer,Soil water,Soil contamination,Risk assessment,Urbanization,Soil water,Soil test,Soil water,Soil contamination,Pollutant,Transfer factor,Soil water,Soil contamination,Soil water,Pollution,Paddy field,Waste disposal,Urbanization,Soil water","Jingru Zhang,Huizhen Li,Yongzhang Zhou,Lei Dou,Zhiyuan Li,Zongwei Ma,Tsering Jan van der Kuijp,Zengwei Yuan,Lei Huang,Domy C.

The field witnessed impressive growth and professionalization for many years and has become one of the key technologies in Germany's energy transition. In recent years, however, it has been confronted with major criticism, which finally resulted in a substantial cut-back of public and political support. The aim of our study is twofold.

People in many cities, who practice urban agriculture, are in most cases unemployed and poor and are faced with water shortages to irrigate their crops. But treated wastewater can offer both water and nutrients needed for crop growth partly covering the water shortage already experienced. Therefore in this case, wastewater reuse becomes one of the important alternative ways to provide water for irrigation. The objective of this study was to monitor the effluent quality of the waste stabilization pond (WSP) and a combined WSP-constructed wetland (WSP-CW) treatment systems, assess its suitability for irrigation purposes and understand the public perception on the use of the treated effluent for agricultural production. This paper brings out the experience of the Moshi urban water authority in wastewater treatment and reuse for irrigation purposes. It looks on the quality of effluent from the two systems under their current operational regime and deduces the public health and socio economic implications. The results indicates the recorded TDS mean values of 587 mg/L and 627 mg/L, Nitrate–Nitrogen values of 9.19 mg/L and 2.35 mg/L, Fecal Coliform values of 1000 counts per 100 mL and 4626 counts per 100 mL, COD values of 159 mg O 2 /L and 149 mg O 2 /L for the WSP and WSP-CW effluents respectively. From the findings it has been shown that the treated effluent is suitable for restricted irrigation. It has also been shown that when improperly practiced, the use of the effluent is associated with public health risk to the workers who handle it, but despite this fact there is still some positive social economic implications. The community members who practice irrigated agriculture using the effluent as irrigation water have positive attitude on its use. The findings from this case study, is considered as an important learning in establishing an optimal wastewater treatment configuration to render suitable effluent for irrigation purposes.","Water scarcity,Water resource management,Wastewater,Urban agriculture,Stabilization pond,Sewage treatment,Irrigation,Hydrology,Geology,Food security,Effluent,Water supply,Water industry,Total suspended solids,Wetland,Water scarcity,Wastewater,Water supply,Water resources,Technical report,Water supply,Water resources,Water quality,Water supply,Water resource management,Water quality,Urbanization,Urban area,Urban agriculture,Water supply,Wastewater,Waste management,Wastewater,Waste management,Subsurface flow,Wetland,Water quality,Surface runoff,Wetland,Wastewater,Waste management","Jacob Kihila,Kelvin M.

267,Farm-level economics of innovative tillage technologies: the case of no-till in the Altai Krai in Russian Siberia,2017-01-01,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,10.1007/S11356-017-9268-Y,"In the agricultural Altai Krai in Russian Siberia, soil degradation problems are prevalent. Agronomists recommend “reduced tillage systems,” especially no-till, as a sustainable way to cultivate land that is threatened by soil degradation. In the Altai Krai, less is known about the technologies in practice. In this paper, we provide information on plant cultivation technologies used in the Altai Krai and on selected factors preventing farm managers in this region from adopting no-till technology based on our own quantitative survey conducted across 107 farms in 2015 and 2016. The results of the quantitative survey show that farm managers have high uncertainty regarding the use of no-till technology including its economics. To close this gap, we provide systematic analysis of factors influencing the economy of the plant production systems by using a farm optimization model (linear programming) for a real farm, together with expert estimations. The farm-specific results of the optimization model show that under optimal management and climatic conditions, the expert Modern Canadian no-till technology outperforms the farm min-till technology, but this is not the case for suboptimal conditions with lower yields.","Tillage,Threatened species,Soil retrogression and degradation,Quantitative survey,Profitability index,No-till farming,Farm level,Environmental engineering,Chemistry,Agronomy,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Sustainable agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Variables,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Stochastic simulation,Risk management,Risk aversion,Simplex algorithm,Revised simplex method,Mathematics,Rural development,Rural area,Incentive,Turnover,Survey data collection,Public economics,Resource poor,Opportunity cost,No-till farming,Water conservation,Traditional knowledge,Tillage,Tillage,Strip-till,No-till farming,Weed control,Tillage,Medium term","Miroslava Bavorova,Nizami Imamverdiyev,Elena Ponkina,Ken E.

The country enacted a new agricultural policy that discourages the cultivation of wheat and encourages that of vegetables and fruits. This has produced significant reductions in irrigation water demand as well as food self-sufficiency. This paper reviews the performance of the Saudi agricultural sector and presents four scenarios forecasting the new policy's long-term impacts on the use of water for agriculture. The findings show that the new policy does not support sustainable utilization of groundwater resources.

We examine the impact of the relocation and settlement program (RSP) to date, reporting on an ecosystem services (ES) assessment and a 1400-household survey. The RSP generally achieves the goals of ES increase and livelihood restore. In biophysical terms, the RSP improves water quality, sediment retention, and carbon sequestration. In social terms, resettled households so far report transformation of livelihoods activities from traditional inefficient agricultural and forest production to non-farm activities. Increased income contributes to decrease the poverty rate and improve resettled households’ living condition and standard. Meanwhile, the RSP decreases households’ dependence on ES in terms of provisioning services. Difficulty and challenge also showed up subsequently after relocation. A major current challenge is to enable poorer households to move, while providing greater follow-up support to relocated households.

270,Yield improvement and adaptation of wheat to water-limited environments in Australia—a case study,2014-01-01,Crop & Pasture Science,10.1071/CP13426,"The improvement in grain yield of wheat throughout Australia through both breeding and management has been impressive. Averaged across all farms, there has been an approximate doubling of yield per unit area since ~1940. This has occurred across a broad range of environments with different rainfall patterns. Interestingly, the gain in the driest years (9 kg ha–1 year–1 or 0.81% year–1) has been proportionally greater than in the most favourable years (13.2 kg ha–1 year–1 or 0.61% per year) when expressed as yield relative to 2012. These data from all farms suggest that further yield progress is likely, and evidence is presented that improved management practices alone could double this rate of progress. The yield increases achieved have been without any known compromise in grain quality or disease resistance. As expected, improvements have come from both changed management and from better genetics, as well as from the synergy between them. Yield improvements due to changed management have been dramatic and are easiest to quantify, whereas those from breeding have been important but more subtle. The management practices responsible have largely been driven by advances in mechanisation that enable direct seeding, more timely and flexible sowing and nutrient management, and improved weed and pest control, many of which have been facilitated by improved crop sequences with grain legumes and oilseeds that improve water- and nutrient-use efficiency. Most of the yield improvements from breeding in Australia have come from conventional breeding approaches where selection is almost solely for grain yield (together with grain quality and disease resistance). Improvements have primarily been through increased harvest index (HI), although aboveground biomass has also been important. We discuss future opportunities to further increase Australian rainfed wheat yields. An important one is earlier planting, which increases resource capture. This will require knowledge of the genes regulating phenological development so that flowering still occurs at the optimum time; appropriate modifications to sowing arrangements and nutrient management will also be required. To improve yield potential, we propose a focus on physiological traits that increase biomass and HI and suggest that there may be more scope to improve biomass than HI. In addition, there are likely to be important opportunities to combine novel management practices with new breeding traits to capture the synergy possible from variety × management interactions. Finally, we comment on research aimed at adapting agriculture to climate change.","Water-use efficiency,Water use,Sowing,Plant breeding,Nutrient management,Grain quality,Botany,Biology,Animal breeding,Agronomy,Agriculture","R.

In particular, mangrove forests have been altered by the shrimp culture. The area of mangrove forests in the region has been reduced and this is seen especially in Tra Vinh province. The results obtained from GIS (Geography Information System) and RS (Remote Sensing) show the status of mangrove forests in Tra Vinh province in 1965, 1995 (Northeastern part of Tra Vinh Province) and 2001. In 1965, the area of mangrove forests was 21,221 ha making up 56% of total land-use, while in 2001 it was 12,797 ha making up 37% of total land-use. Also based on GIS analysis, over the 36 years (1965e2001), the total coverage of mangrove forests have decreased by 50% since 1965. However, the speed of mangrove forest destruction in the period from 1965 to 1995 was much less than that in the period from 1995 to 2001. The average annual reduction in mangrove forest coverage in the first period (1965e1995) was 0.2% whereas it was 13.1% in the later period (1995e2001). For the long time, mangrove deforestation has been caused by war, collection of firewood and clearing for agriculture, and recently, shrimp farming has significantly contributed rate of mangrove destruction. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose, a system dynamics model (AISEEM) has been developed to explore the potential long-term ecological, economic, institutional and social interactions of ecological agricultural development through a case study of Jinshan County in China. The model provides an experimental platform for the simulation and analysis of alternative policy scenarios. The results indicate that the diversification of land-use patterns, government low interest loans and government support for training are important policy measures for promoting the sustainable development of ecological agriculture, at least in the case study context. In addition, the study reveals that environmentally sound technology (e.g., biogas project) alone cannot sufficiently induce farmers to adopt ecological agricultural practices. Limited availability of information, risk aversion and high transaction costs are major barriers to the adoption of alternative agricultural practices. In this regard, the importance of capacity building and institutional arrangements are emphasised through the development of an improved policy-making process on agricultural sustainability. This case study highlights the importance of combining the ecological economics analytical framework with the system dynamics modelling approach as a feasible integrated tool to provide insight into the policy analysis of ecological agriculture, and thus set a solid basis for effective policy making to facilitate its sustainable development on a regional scale.","Transaction cost,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Policy analysis,Environmental resource management,Economics,Ecological economics,Capacity building,Agriculture,Agricultural policy,Sociology,Single-subject design,Organizational Case Studies,Sociology,SAGE,Knowledge generation,System dynamics,Model validity,Model validation,Team learning,System dynamics,Project management,System dynamics,Predictability,Functional ecology,Water scarcity,Water resources,Sustainable development,Sociology,Multi-agent system,Law,Systems ecology,System dynamics,Socio-ecological system,Sustainable development,Sustainability science,Sustainability organizations,Normalized Difference Vegetation Index,Metapopulation,Extinction","Tian Shi,Roderic Gill,Robert K.

Euclidian-Distance-Matching is used to identify for each organic farm a conventional counterpart with similar structural features. Results indicate that output variability in both production technologies is mainly caused by production risk. Land and labour are identified as risk-increasing inputs in both farm types whereas higher capital endowment, seed costs and soil quality have risk-reducing effects.","Stochastic frontier analysis,Soil quality,Organic farming,Intensive farming,Inefficiency,Endowment,Economics,Arable land,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Stochastic frontier analysis,Statistics,Profit efficiency,sort,Stochastic frontier analysis,Random variable,Technology gap,Panel data,Microeconomics,Statistics,Robustness (computer science),Propensity score matching,Stochastic process,Stochastic frontier analysis,Statistics,Stochastic frontier analysis,Simar,Production–possibility frontier,Wald test,Statistics,Sequential test,Welfare economics,Livestock,Labour economics,Organic farming,Livestock,Economics,Technology choice,Subsidy,Organic farming","Torben Tiedemann,Uwe Latacz‐Lohmann,G E Battese,Timothy Coelli,Dennis Aigner,C.A.Knox Lovell,Peter Schmidt,George E.

Water quality indices can and have been used to identify threats to water quality along a stream and contribute to better water resources management. There are many water quality indices for the assessment and use of surface water for drinking purposes. However, there is no well-established index for the assessment and direct use of river water for irrigation purposes. The aim of this study was to adopt the framework of the National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSFWQI) and, with adjustments, apply it in a way which will conform to irrigation water quality requirements. To accomplish this, the NSFWQI parameters for drinking water use were amended to include water quality parameters suitable for irrigation. For each selected parameter, an individual weighting chart was generated according to the FAO 29 guideline. The NSFWQI formula was then used to calculate a final index value, and for each parameter an acceptable range in this value was determined. The new index was then applied to the Ghezel Ozan River in Iran as a case study. A forty five year record of water quality data (1966 to 2010) was collected from four hydrometery stations along the river. Water quality parameters including Na + , Cl − , pH, HCO −  3, EC, SAR and TDS were employed for water quality analysis using the adjusted NSFWQI formula. The results of this case study showed variation in water quality from the upstream to downstream ends of the river. Consistent monitoring of the river water quality and the establishment of a long term management plan were recommended for the protection of this valuable water resource.","Water use,Water resources,Water quality,Surface water,Sanitation,River water,Irrigation,Hydrology,Environmental engineering,Chemistry,Agriculture,Vulnerability,Sustainability,Latin Americans,Vulnerability,Group ii,Environmental science,Water quality,Wastewater,Sampling (statistics),Water resources,Mathematics,Econometrics,Water quality,Total dissolved solids,Oxygen saturation,Water quality,Water pollution,Turbidity,Water quality,Sample point,Pollution,Water supply,Water resource management,Water quality,Water quality,Surface water quality,Statistics,Sustainability and environmental management,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Global warming","Farhad Misaghi,Fatemeh Delgosha,Mostafa Razzaghmanesh,Baden Myers,Martin Parry,Osvaldo Canziani,Jean Palutikof,Paul van der Linden,Clair Hanson,Tarekegn Abeku,Pamela Abuodha,Francis Adesina,Neil Adger,John Agard,Sangam Shrestha,F.

This paper analyzes the effects of Germany's biogas policies on agricultural development by using the agent-based simulation model AgriPoliS. Particular focus is placed on the effects of the previous German Renewable Energy Act (REA, German “EEG”) of 2012, as well as the latest amendments, which were added in 2014. Our results show that under the previous REA and its predecessors, biogas production provided an attractive investment opportunity, especially for large farms, which led to a boost in biogas production. However, this policy also caused distortions within the agricultural sector, including increasing land rental prices. These effects particularly threatened farms that were not able to invest in biogas, as well as smaller biogas farms. On average, biogas farms could not increase their profitability. The main reason for this effect can be seen in the fact that a significant share of the value added is transferred via increased rental prices to land owners. The amendment of the REA in 2014, which reduced support levels substantially, partly attenuates some of these effects, though the previous policy will cast a long shadow.","Renting,Renewable energy,Profitability index,Microeconomics,German,Economics,Biogas production,Biogas,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural economics,Humanities,Economics,Technical change,Simulation modeling,Minor (value),Structural adjustment,Standard of living,Natural resource economics,Structural change,Structural adjustment,Policy analysis,Structural change,Operations management,Microeconomics,Welfare economics,Renewable energy,Legislation,Renting,Renewable energy law,Energy crop,Sustainability,Spatial planning,Renewable energy,Vertical integration,Sunk costs,Subsidy,Structural change,Purchasing,Nonfarm payrolls","Franziska Appel,Arlette Ostermeyer-Wiethaup,Alfons Balmann,Peter Salje,Kathrin Happe,Konrad Kellermann,Alfons Balmann,Kathrin Happe,Kathrin Happe,Alfons Balmann,Konrad Kellermann,Christoph Sahrbacher,Alfons Balmann,M.

278,"Rural Farmers' Problems Accessing Agricultural Information: A Case Study of Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State, Nigeria",2011-01-01,Library Philosophy and Practice,,"Introduction Rural farmers account for the greater part of the population of any developing country such as Nigeria. Governments of developing countries have a major responsibility of ensuring that there is adequate rural development in their various communities and local governments which would lead to effective and efficient agricultural systems that will not only supply food and animal protein but also foster the utilization of natural resources in a sustainable manner (CGIAR, 1995). When the rural farmers lack access to knowledge and information that would help them achieve maximum agricultural yield, they are not only grope in the dark but are driven to the urban centres in search of formal employment, as the only option for survival (Munyua, 2000). Blait (1996) pointed out that the least expensive input for improved rural agricultural development is adequate access to knowledge and information in areas of new agricultural technologies, early warning systems (drought, pests, diseases etc), improved seedlings, fertilizer, credit, market prices etc. There have been short-comings of traditional print and library based methods (Van and Fortier, 2000) of providing such agricultural information to rural farmers who are generally illiterate and relatively remote from formal sources of information (e.g. extension stations, libraries). Aina (2007) also, was of the opinion that farmers would benefit from global information, if information centres, are cited in rural areas complete with all information and communication gadgets. Rural farmers in Nsukka local government area of Enugu state are not noted to produce enough food, probably due to some constraints that lead to lack of access to timely and up-to-date information which would have enabled them to achieve optimal yield from their farmlands. Such information is highly desired by these farmers and can only be made available to them via extension workers, community libraries, state and local government agricultural agencies (ADP, ENADEP etc), email or the World Wide Web (WWW) in a telecentre (Telecommons Development Group, 2000). In this modern day of information technology, telecentres provide the rural farmers with prompt and reliable information about what is happening in areas of improved seedlings, better methods of cultivation and fertilizer application, pest and weed control/eradication, new advances in livestock production and disease control etc. Where rural farmers are not faced with constraints in accessing agricultural information, traditional media such as rural radio, has been used in delivering agricultural messages to rural farmers (Munyua, 2000). Other ways of delivering these messages or information to the rural farmers include print, video, television, films, slides, pictures, drama, dance, folklore, group discussions, meetings, exhibitions and demonstrations (Munyua, 2000). The lack of access to basic agricultural knowledge and information by rural farmers in Nsukka local government area of Enugu State which may be as a result of certain constraints has made these farmers to stick to their old traditional methods of farming system and animal husbandry practice, hence resulting in poor crop and livestock productivity. Information and knowledge are very vital in agricultural development of any community and where they are poorly disseminated as a result of certain constraints, the community's agricultural development becomes highly impeded. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the constraints of the rural farmers in Nsukka local government area of Enugu State in accessing agricultural information. Statement of the Problem Over the years, our rural farmers depend on indigenous or local knowledge for improved farming system/animal husbandry. Such knowledge (indigenous or local knowledge) refers to skill and experience gained through oral tradition and practice over many generations (Norem, et al., 1988). Acquisition of such primitive skill by our rural farmers (e. …","Rural management,Rural area,Population,Natural resource,Local government area,Local government,Information technology,Economic growth,Business,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Political science,Humanities,Ethnology,Youth unemployment,Self-employment,Labour law,The Internet,Telecommunications,Public relations","Nnenna A.

279,"Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture: A Case of Study of Coffee Production in Veracruz, Mexico",2006-01-01,Climatic Change,10.1007/S10584-006-9066-X,"This paper explores the relation between coffee production and climatic and economic variables in Veracruz in order to estimate the potential impacts of climate change. For this purpose, an econometric model is developed in terms of those variables. The model is validated by means of statistical analysis, and then used to project coffee production under different climatic conditions. Climate change scenarios are produced considering that the observed trends of climate variables will continue to prevail until the year 2020. An approach for constructing simple probability scenarios for future climate variability is presented and used to assess possible impacts of climate change beyond what is expected from changes in mean values. The model shows that temperature is the most relevant climatic factor for coffee production, since production responds significantly to seasonal temperature patterns. The results for the projected climate change conditions for year 2020 indicate that coffee production might not be economically viable for producers, since the model indicates a reduction of 34% of the current production. Although different economic variables (the state and international coffee prices, a producer price index for raw materials for coffee benefit, the national and the USA coffee stocks) were considered as potentially relevant, our model suggests that the state real minimum wage could be regarded as the most important economic variable. Real minimum wage is interpreted here as a proxy for the price of labor employed for coffee production.

283,Sustainable Development in Malaysia: A Case Study on Household Waste Management,2010-01-01,Journal of Sustainable Development,10.5539/JSD.V3N3P91,"Sustainable development (SD) is a concept which first originated in the 1970s when the developed world undertook massive development project in terms of cutting and clearing forests and constructing high rising buildings and spacious highways. Development of a country is essential to meet the needs of its people and to provide people with the latest infrastructure, high rising buildings and recreation facilities. However, the development process concerns the world community as it affects the natural environment. The ecological balance breaks down and environmental degradation occurs at an alarming rate. Therefore, the world community started thinking about protecting the environment while implementing development activities. Environmental degradation also occurs from intensive industrialization of a country. Therefore, to protect the environment, the world community proposed sustainable development. Sustainable development has three components: economic development; social development; and environmental protection. A sustainable development project requires that in any development project, these three components of SD must be taken into consideration and implemented properly so that the environment is not adversely affected. This paper focuses only on a small aspect of environmental protection, that is, proper management of household waste. This paper discusses how household waste in Malaysia can be converted into vermicompost for use in plantations and agriculture. The production of vermicompost may reduce the amount of organic waste in the country and help to maintain a clean and fresh environment. Vermicompost can also reduce emission of methane gas which causes global warming.

Concerned public institutions require specific tools to select the most relevant projects among numerous projects proposed in a transparent and prudent way. To this end, a multicriteria decision aiding method was developed to select among 16 projects that have been proposed on farming fields in Haute Corse. This paper details the main stages in the multicriteria methodology, including criteria and constraint definition, criteria weight set calculations, threshold and concordance level determination and the implementation of the chosen multicriteria model, ELECTRE IS. Thus, considering different points of view (energy, geo-economic, ecological, visual impact, territorial use, financial effect), eight criteria have been defined, one of which is optional. The method applied to the reviewed data allowed building 6 weight sets, while a concordance level of 2/3. Using this method, based on our criteria sets and according to the weights and concordance levels determined by the client, 4 projects were selected among the 16 initial ones, with the robustness of these results being tested through all criteria weight sets and different concordance level applications.","Robustness (computer science),Program evaluation,Photovoltaic system,Operations research,Operations management,Multicriteria decision,Environmental resource management,Energy policy,Economics,ELECTRE,Concordance,Agriculture,Operations research,Multiple-criteria decision analysis,Multi-objective optimization,Ranking,Operations research,Multiple-criteria decision analysis,Ranking,Project management,Optimal decision,Computer science,Software,Public transport,Operations research,Renewable energy,Profitability index,Operations research,Sustainable energy,Sustainable development,Renewable energy,Wind power,Renewable energy,Ranking,Renewable energy,Operations research,Operations management,Renewable energy,Operations research,Operations management","Pierrick Haurant,P.

The level of fertilizer use, especially overuse, as well as farming practices in the region have a great impact on the water quality downstream and affect an enormous number of people. This study analyzes the factors influencing the farmers’ decisions on fertilizer use and the implications for water quality. The analysis is based on a survey of 349 farm households. It takes into consideration both farm and farmer specific characteristics and farmers’ subjective evaluations of factors shaping their decisions. Regression models are used to examine the determinants of fertilizer use intensity across farm households and to investigate the factors influencing the overuse of nitrogen. The results suggest that many of these subjective factors have great significance in determining famers’ decisions. The results also show that irrigation, gains in crop yield and higher earning goals are positively correlated with fertilizer use intensity, while farm size, manure application, soil fertility and the distance to fertilizer markets are negatively correlated. Investigation of the overuse problem shows that higher education level significantly reduces the probability of over-fertilization. Based on these findings a few policy relevant implications are discussed.","Watershed,Water resource management,Water quality,Soil fertility,Manure,Irrigation,Fertilizer,Beijing,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Time series,Statistics,Simple linear regression,Theory of reasoned action,Theory of planned behavior,Technology acceptance model,Task value,Social psychology,Psychology,Variable cost,Technological change,Small farm,Regression analysis,Population,Per capita,Tobit model,Stratified sampling,Sierra leone,West africa,Tobit model,Subjective perception,Volatilisation,Surface runoff,Nitrogen,R-CAST,Process management,Marketing,Tillage,Soil characteristics,Microdata (HTML)","Yuan Zhou,Hong Yang,Hans-Joachim Mosler,Karim C.

286,The influence of fertiliser and pesticide emissions model on life cycle assessment of agricultural products: The case of Danish and Italian barley,2017-01-01,Science of The Total Environment,10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2016.11.183,"Abstract Barley is an ancient crop and a great source of nutrients. It is the third largest agricultural commodity produced in Denmark and represents a relevant crop in Italy too. Due to the increasing customers awareness of sustainability issues, it has become essential to evaluate the environmental impact and the use of resources in food production and distribution systems. However, especially in agriculture, difficulties are encountered when emissions from fertilisers and pesticides need to be modelled, due to a variety of modelling options and their dependency on the availability of site-specific information. How to address these difficulties might affect the results reliability. Hence, this study aims to evaluate, using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, the influence of different models for estimating emissions from fertilisers and pesticides on the environmental impacts of barley cultivation in Denmark and Italy. Two models for fertilisers and pesticides’ emissions have been applied; these differ on the extent of data requirements and complexity of calculation algorithms, which might increase the results accuracy and robustness. The results show that the modelling options do affect the environmental impacts of barley production, in particular climate change, eutrophication categories, acidification and freshwater eco-toxicity. This study estimates that the variations for such categories range from 15% in the case of climate change to 89% in the case of marine eutrophication. These findings highlight the importance of the emission modelling options as well as the constraints of data requirements, critical aspects when a LCA study on agricultural products is carried out.","Sustainability,Pesticide,Life-cycle assessment,Food processing,Eutrophication,Environmental impact assessment,Environmental engineering,Climate change,Chemistry,Agriculture,Landfill gas utilization,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas accounting,Stakeholder,Risk analysis (engineering),Operations research,Sustainable products,Life-cycle assessment,Information sharing,SNP genotyping,Plant breeding,Germplasm,Waste management,Life-cycle assessment,Environmental impact assessment,Waste management,Surface water,Spatial Dependency,Soil organic matter,Soil classification,Soil carbon,Mechanization,Life-cycle assessment,Inventory data,Waste management,Tomato puree,Renewable resource,Staple food,Reactive nitrogen,Leaching (agriculture)","Ximena C.

This in turn will seriously impact on the welfare of the people, particularly the rural farmers whose main livelihood depends on rain-fed agriculture. The level of impacts will mainly depend on the awareness and the level of adaptation in response to the changing climate. It is thus important to understand the role of the different factors that influence farmers’ adaptation to ensure the development of appropriate policy measures and the design of successful development projects. This study examines farmers’ perception of change in climatic attributes and the factors that influence farmers’ choice of adaptation measures to climate change and variability. The estimated results from the climate change adaptation models indicate that level of education, age and wealth of the head of the household; access to credit and agricultural services; information on climate, and temperature all influence farmers’ choices of adaptation. Moreover, lack of information on adaptation measures and lack of finance are seen as the main factors inhibiting adaptation to climate change.

Mombasa is Kenya's second largest city and has more than 700,000 inhabitants. It is the largest seaport in East Africa, serving not only Kenya but also many landlocked countries and the north of Tanzania. The city has a history of disasters related to climate extremes including fl oods, which cause serious damage nearly every year and, often, loss of life. The fl oods in October 2006 were particularly serious, affecting some 60,000 people in the city and the wider province. In addition, around 17 per cent of Mombasa's area could be submerged by a sea-level rise of 0.3 metres, with a larger area rendered uninhabitable or unusable for agriculture because of water logging and salt stress. Tourism is an important part of the city's economy. Thus, sandy beaches, historic and cultural monuments and several hotels, industries and port facilities would be negatively affected. This paper also discusses the measures needed to reduce the vulnerability of Mombasa's population and economic base to climate change.","Vulnerability,Tourism,Socioeconomics,Population,Landlocked country,Human settlement,Economics,Economic base analysis,Climate change,Agriculture,Tar,Sea surface temperature,Sea level,Geography,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection","Cynthia Brenda Awuor,Victor Ayo Orindi,Andrew Ochieng Adwera,N.

Due to rapid urbanization and industrialization, farmland abandonment has become an increasingly important problem in many countries, particularly in China. To promote sustainable land-use management and environmental sustainability, it is important to understand the socioeconomic causes and spatial patterns of farmland abandonment. In this study, we explored the dynamic mechanisms of farmland abandonment in Jiangxi province of China using a spatially explicit economical model. The results show that the variables associated with the agricultural products yield are significantly correlated with farmland abandonment. The increasing opportunity cost of farming labor is the main factor in farmland abandonment in conjunction with a rural labor shortage due to rural-to-urban population migration and regional industrialization. Farmlands are more likely to be abandoned in areas located far from the villages and towns due to higher transportation costs. Additionally, farmers with more land but lower net income are more likely to abandon poor-quality farmland. Our results support the hypothesis that farmland abandonment takes place in locations in which the costs of cultivation are high and the potential crop yield is low. In addition, our study also demonstrates that a spatially explicit economic model is necessary to distinguish between the main driving forces of farmland abandonment. Policy implications are also provided for potential future policy decisions.","Urbanization,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Opportunity cost,Net income,Industrialisation,Food security,Environmental resource management,Economics,Agriculture,Maximum likelihood sequence estimation,M-estimator,Likelihood-ratio test,Population,Nitrogen cycle,Global change,Unit-weighted regression,Statistics,Multinomial logistic regression,Sustainability,Poverty,Population growth,Statistics,Segmented regression,Robust regression,Natural resource economics,Land use,European union,Reforestation,Natural resource economics,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Economics,Econometrics,Sustainable management,Spatial ecology,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Vegetation,Reforestation,Land use, land-use change and forestry","Hualin Xie,Peng Wang,Guanrong Yao,Hirotogu Akaike,Peter M.

Using a recently developed life cycle assessment-based methodology that takes into account local water stress where operations occur, the normalized water footprints of milk products from South Gippsland, one of Australia's major dairy regions, were 14.4 L/kg of total milk solids in whole milk (at farm gate) and 15.8 L/kg of total milk solids in skim milk powder (delivered to export destination). These results demonstrate that dairy products can be produced with minimal potential to contribute to freshwater scarcity.

291,"Local Perceptions and Responses to Climate Change and Variability: The Case of Laikipia District, Kenya",2012-01-01,Sustainability,10.3390/SU4123302,"Agricultural policies in Kenya aim to improve farmers’ livelihoods. With projected climate change, these policies are short of mechanisms that promote farmers’ adaptation. As a result, smallholders are confronted with a variety of challenges including climate change, which hinders their agricultural production. Local knowledge can be instrumental in assisting smallholders to cope with climate change and variability. In this paper, we present empirical evidence that demonstrates local knowledge, perceptions and adaptations to climate change and variability amongst smallholders of Laikipia district of Kenya. A Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) calculated for one station is compared with smallholders’ perceptions. Data was collected using qualitative and quantitative methods in Umande and Muhonia sub-locations. Qualitative data included 46 transcripts from focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Quantitative data is derived from 206 interviewees. We analyzed qualitative and quantitative data using Atlas-ti and SPSS respectively. According to smallholders’ perceptions, climatic variability is increasingly changing. Local perceptions include decreasing rainfalls, increasing temperatures, increasing frosts and increasing hunger. The PDSI shows a trend towards severe droughts in the last four decades, which is in accordance with farmers’ perceptions. Smallholders use a combination of coping and adaptation strategies to respond to variability, including, among others, diversification of crop varieties, migration and sale of livestock. Significant relationships exist between drought perceptions and some adaptations such as migration and sale of livestock. Farmers have an in-depth knowledge of climatic variability, which they use to inform their coping and adaptation strategies. Knowledge of climatic perceptions and adaptations are vital entry points for decision makers and policy makers to learn how and where to enhance the adaptive capacity of smallholders in rainy and drought periods.","Qualitative property,Livelihood,Focus group,Environmental resource management,Economics,Diversification (marketing strategy),Climate change,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Adaptive capacity,Global warming,Environmental science,Effects of global warming,Vulnerability,Sustainability,Latin Americans,Environmental science,Environmental resource management,Climate change,Social research,Secondary research,Research ethics,Water resources,Vulnerability index,Vulnerability assessment,Physics,Climatology,Climate change,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Top-down and bottom-up design,Solidarity,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Environmental science,Climatology,Climate change,Sociology,Qualitative research,Qualitative property","Sarah Ayeri Ogalleh,Christian R.

294,Measuring household resilience to floods: A case study in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta,2013-01-01,Ecology and Society,10.5751/ES-05427-180313,"The flood is a well-known phenomenon in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta (MRD). Although people have experienced the impact of floods for years, some adapt well, but others are vulnerable to floods. Resilience to floods is a useful concept to study the capacity of rural households to cope with, adapt to, and benefit from floods. Knowledge of the resilience of households to floods can help disaster risk managers to design policies for living with floods. Most researchers attempt to define the concept of resilience; very little research operationalizes it in the real context of ""living with floods"". We employ a subjective well-being approach to measure households' resilience to floods. Items that related to households' capacity to cope with, adapt to, and benefit from floods were developed using both a five-point Likert scale and dichotomous responses. A factor analysis using a standardized form of data was employed to identify underlying factors that explain different properties of households' resilience to floods. Three properties of households' resilience to floods were found: (1) households' confidence in securing food, income, health, and evacuation during floods and recovery after floods; (2) households' confidence in securing their homes not being affected by a large flood event such as the 2000 flood; (3) households' interests in learning and practicing new flood-based farming practices that are fully adapted to floods for improving household income during the flood season. The findings assist in designing adaptive measures to cope with future flooding in the MRD.","Vulnerability,Vietnamese,Psychological resilience,Household income,Flooding (psychology),Flood myth,Environmental resource management,Emergency management,Economics,Agriculture,Socio-ecological system,Social network,Social learning,Social psychology,Social capital,Psychology,Socio-ecological system,Regime shift,Psychological resilience,Vulnerability index,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Vulnerability,Social system,Social capital,Sociology,Socio-ecological system,Social science,Sustainable development,Summit,Social system,Population,Natural resource economics,International development,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Socio-ecological system,Vulnerability,Socioeconomics,Social vulnerability","Kien V.

Based on the participatory research method, we studied the attitudes of the stakeholders who are involved in reclaimed water reuse in Beijing, China. Results showed that the general public’s knowledge on water resources was poor, while their awareness on reclaimed water reuse was high. The general public showed a strong acceptance of non-contact and non-potable reclaimed water reuse, but their acceptance of the three major water reuse types of river water supplement, park water supplement, and agriculture irrigation was not high. The beneficial use of reclaimed water was admired by water resource managers, industrial sectors, and researchers, and these stakeholders strongly supported the advancement of reclaimed water reuse. However, some of the stakeholders showed concerns about the potential risks from reclaimed wastewater reuse. Among them, risks from waste water treatment facilities were the biggest concern. Stakeholders’ perception of reclaimed water was influenced by their social-economic attributes.

In this paper, we further investigate the inter-relationship between land economic value (LEV) and ALC. To achieve this goal, we calculated the LEV for agricultural and non-agricultural (housing) uses in two areas of East Java, Indonesia. The first area represents peri-urban agriculture, which is facing rapid urbanization and experiencing a high rate of ALC. The second area represents rural agriculture, with zero ALC. Furthermore, we identified factors affecting LEV in both areas for both uses. The results of this study show that agricultural land yielded a higher economic benefit in rural areas. Conversely, compared to agricultural land, housing in urban areas yields a value that is seven times higher. Moreover, agricultural land was shown to yield a higher profit after conversion. Ironically, a similar comparison does not exist in rural areas. Agricultural land yielded a value that was only 19% higher, indicating that agricultural land can easily be converted. This is also proven by the growing number of new urban cores in the periphery area. There are several factors affecting land economic value, such as agricultural use, soil fertility, accessibility, and cropping pattern, which are important variables. Meanwhile, the accessibility and location of peri-urban areas increase the land value for housing.","Urbanization,Sustainable agriculture,Soil fertility,Rural area,Java,Economics,Cropping,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural land,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Urban sprawl,Urban ecosystem,Urban density,Urbanization,Urban agriculture,Poverty,Urban agriculture,Urban agglomeration,Peri-urban agriculture,Urban sprawl,Spatial heterogeneity,Spatial distribution,Urban area,Thresholding,Remote sensing,Urban sprawl,Subdivision,Spillover effect,Water resource management,Suitability analysis,Land use,Urbanization,Sustainability,Spatial segregation,Urbanization,Urban planning,Sustainable development","Mohammad Rondhi,Pravitasari Anjar Pratiwi,Vivi Trisna Handini,Aryo Fajar Sunartomo,Subhan Arif Budiman,Jonathan A.

Donor organizations, local governments, insurance companies, development economists as well as agricultural economists are discussing the costs and benefits of WII. While the literature on WII has mainly focused on many cases in Africa and Asia, in this article we analyze the WII program in Mexico, which is one of the largest WII programs worldwide. In this context we discuss potentially important spill-over effects on related markets which so far have not been considered in the academic literature. First, we argue that WII creates disincentives to invest in other non-insured crops leading to potential overspecialization and monoculture. Secondly, WII generates disincentives to invest in irrigation systems because farmers are insured only as long as production takes place on non-irrigated land. Third, in case of catastrophic events food prices can potentially inflate with indemnity payments at the expense of the uninsured poor. We also suggest that in Mexico the thresholds of the weather index be (continuously) re-calibrated in order to adjust for the development of drought resistant seeds. Finally, the index could relatively easily be extended to account for precipitation variances. We argue that these factors and spillover effects should be accounted for in cost benefit analysis of WII.","Unintended consequences,Spillover effect,Public economics,Payment,Indemnity,Food prices,Finance,Economics,Developing country,Cost–benefit analysis,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Risk pool,Public economics,Microinsurance,Smoothing,Risk pool,Microeconomics,Weather insurance,Microinsurance,Microeconomics,Weather insurance,Socioeconomics,Risk transfer,Weather insurance,Weather index,Rural settlement,Weather insurance,Risk aversion,Redistribution of income and wealth,Weather insurance,Weather index,Economics,Welfare,Weather index,Social insurance,Subsidy,Natural field,Microinsurance,Underwriting,Reinsurance,Real gross domestic product","Alan Fuchs,Hendrik Wolff,Shawn Allen Cole,Xavier Giné,Jeremy Tobacman,Petia B.

298,Creating patches of native flowers facilitates crop pollination in large agricultural fields: mango as a case study,2012-01-01,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/J.1365-2664.2012.02217.X,"Summary 1. As cropland increases, fields become progressively isolated from pollinators, leading to declines in pollinator-dependent crop productivity. With the rise in demand for pollinatordependent foods, such productivity losses may accelerate conversion of natural areas to cropland. Pollination–compensation measures involving managed pollinators or hand pollination are not always optimal or are too costly. Introducing areas of native vegetation within cropland has been proposed as a way to supplement crop pollinators, but this measure is perceived by farmers to carry costs outweighing benefits to agricultural production. Studies quantifying benefits of small patches of native flowers to crop pollination are therefore necessary to encourage such practices. 2. To ascertain whether provision of floral resources within farmlands can facilitate pollination, and hence, crop yields, small experimental patches of perennial native plants (native flower compensation areas, NFCAs) were created in nonproductive areas of large commercial fields of several cultivars of mango Mangifera indica. 3. Pesticide use and isolation from natural habitat were associated with declines in flying visitors and in mango production (kg of marketable fresh fruit), but presence of NFCAs ameliorated these declines, and NFCAs did not harbour any mango pests. In areas far from natural vegetation, orchards near NFCAs had significantly higher diversity and abundance of mango flying visitors, as well as mango production, than orchards far from NFCAs, although these measures were still lower than in orchards close to natural areas. 4. Neither the most abundant flower visitors to mango (ants) nor initial fruit set was significantly affected by distance, pesticides or NFCAs, suggesting that although fertilization is associated with factors unaffected by isolation from natural habitat and pesticide use (i.e. selfand ant-pollination), viable fruit set (and ultimately, production) requires cross-pollination, for which flying visitors are essential. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the presence of small patches of native flowers within large farms can increase pollinator-dependent crop production if combined with preservation of remaining fragments of natural habitat and judicious use of pesticides. Native flower compensation areas represent a profitable management measure for farmers, increasing cost-effectiveness of cropland while indirectly contributing to preservation of natural habitat.","Pollinator,Pollination,Native plant,Hand-pollination,Ecology,Crop yield,Crop,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Nonlinear system,Nonlinear mixed effects model,Mixed effects,Wildlife conservation,Species richness,Landscape-scale conservation,Pollinator decline,Pollination,Peponapis pruinosa,Statistical inference,Predictive inference,Physics,Vegetation,Umbrella species,Measurement of biodiversity,Stock (geology),Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Species richness,Pollinator,Pollination,Rainforest,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Trait,Nest,Life history theory,Worker bee,Pollinator decline,Pollinator","Luísa G.

299,Subfield profitability analysis reveals an economic case for cropland diversification,2015-01-01,Environmental Research Letters,10.1088/1748-9326/11/1/014009,"Public agencies and private enterprises increasingly desire to achieve ecosystem service outcomes in agricultural systems, but are limited by perceived conflicts between economic and ecosystem service goals and a lack of tools enabling effective operational management. Here we use Iowa—an agriculturally homogeneous state representative of the Maize Belt—to demonstrate an economic rationale for cropland diversification at the subfield scale. We used a novel computational framework that integrates disparate but publicly available data to map ~3.3 million unique potential management polygons (9.3 Mha) and reveal subfield opportunities to increase overall field profitability. We analyzed subfield profitability for maize/soybean fields during 2010–2013—four of the most profitable years in recent history—and projected results for 2015. While cropland operating at a loss of US$ 250 ha−1 or more was negligible between 2010 and 2013 at 18 000–190 000 ha (<2% of row-crop land), the extent of highly unprofitable land increased to 2.5 Mha, or 27% of row-crop land, in the 2015 projection. Aggregation of these areas to the township level revealed 'hotspots' for potential management change in Western, Central, and Northeast Iowa. In these least profitable areas, incorporating conservation management that breaks even (e.g., planting low-input perennials), into low-yielding portions of fields could increase overall cropland profitability by 80%. This approach is applicable to the broader region and differs substantially from the status quo of 'top-down' land management for conservation by harnessing private interest to align profitability with the production of ecosystem services.","Status quo,Profitability index,Profitability analysis,Land management,Ecosystem services,Economics,Diversification (marketing strategy),Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Agricultural diversification,Waste management,Net energy gain,Ethanol fuel,Trend analysis,Physics,Meteorology,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Political science,Water pollution,Renewable fuels,Nitrogen cycle,Renewable fuels,Pasture,Ecosystem,Web site,Sociology,Natural resource,Soybean aphid,Pest control,Integrated pest management,Political economy of climate change,Natural resource economics,Geography,Nitrogen,Engineering,Biotechnology,Perennial plant,Panicum virgatum,Nitrate","Elke Brandes,Gabriel S.

The major management related flows of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) were quantified over a 1-year period for intensive small-scale aquatic and terrestrial vegetable systems situated in two peri-urban areas of Hanoi City, Vietnam. The two areas have different sources of irrigation water; wastewater from Hanoi City and water from the Red River upstream of Hanoi. The first nutrient balances for this region and farming systems are presented. The main sources of individual elements were quantified and the nutrient use efficiency estimated. The environmental risks for losses and/or soil accumulation were also assessed and discussed in relation to long-term sustainability and health aspects. The primary source of nutrient input involved a combination of chemical fertilisers, manure (chicken) and irrigation water. A variable composition and availability of the latter two sources greatly influenced the relative magnitude of the final total loads for individual elements. Despite relatively good nutrient use efficiencies being demonstrated for N (46–86%) and K (66–94%), and to some extent also for P (19–46%), high inputs still resulted in substantial annual surpluses causing risks for losses to surface and ground waters. The surplus for N ranged from 85 to 882 kg ha−1 year−1, compared to P and K which were 109–196 and 20–306 kg ha−1 year−1, respectively. Those for Cu and Zn varied from 0.2 to 2.7 and from 0.6 to 7.7 kg ha−1 year−1, respectively, indicating high risk for soil accumulation and associated transfers through the food chain. Wastewater irrigation contributed to high inputs, and excess use of organic and chemical fertilisers represent a major threat to the soil and water environment. Management options that improve nutrient use efficiency represent an important objective that will help reduce annual surpluses. A sustainable reuse of wastewater for irrigation in peri-urban farming systems can contribute significantly to the nutrient supply (assuming low concentrations of potential toxic or hazardous substances in the water). Nutrient inputs need to be better related to the crop need, e.g. through better knowledge about the nutrient concentrations in the wastewater and improved management of the amount of irrigation water being applied.","Water environment,Wastewater,Vegetable farming,Nutrient management,Nutrient,Manure,Irrigation,Biology,Agronomy,Agriculture,Water supply,Water industry,Total suspended solids,Zinc,Soil contamination,Selenium,Soil test,Environmental ethics,Botany,Water use,Water resource management,Water quality,Water quality,Vegetable farming,Urban area,Wet season,Washout (aeronautics),Subtropics,Food science,Environmental science,Sustainable development,Screening tool,Nutrient management,Soil water,Soil pH,Soil Pollutants,Water resources,Urban waste,Income generation","Nguyen Manh Khai,Pham Quang Ha,Ingrid Öborn,A.E.

This species is a perennial with an annual growth cycle. Installation by sowing was successful in spite of the extreme drought that occurred during this first cycle (221 mm), and the plants developed well during the second cycle (with 556 mm rainfall) with a mean density of 27 thousand plants per ha. Aerial photographs showed that 45.8 ha of the field had over 50% of ground cover by cardoon plants. The observed differences in soil occupation could be explained by rock outcrops, soil heterogeneity and land topography. The field biomass yield was estimated at 7.5 t ha−1 and the plants at harvest had on average 2.1 m height and 2.2 cm stalk diameter, with 5.3 capitula per plant. Stalks represented 59.1% of total dry biomass. The capitula contain small oil seeds with an average of 126 seeds per capitulum and weighing 32 g per 1000 seeds. The mean seed yield was 603 kg ha−1. The results of this experiment confirm that Cynara crops are suitable for biomass production in Mediterranean regions and that large scale operation can be applied including whole plant harvest or field fractionation for seed recovery. Careful attention to cultural practices was deemed important for field homogeneity and production. The observed plant variation, namely in oil seed production, suggests potential improvements through breeding.","Sowing,Precipitation,Perennial plant,Mediterranean climate,Horticulture,Cynara,Crop,Chemistry,Botany,Biomass,Agronomy,Agriculture,Solid fuel,Renewable fuels,Renewable energy,Sowing,Irrigation,Energy crop,Renewable resource,Raw material,Lignocellulosic biomass,Water use,Sunflower,Sowing,Ultimate tensile strength,Stalk,Pulp (paper),Population,Horticulture,Dry weight,Energy source,Energy crop,Energy balance,Population,Permanent crop,Perennial plant,Vegetable oil,Transesterification,Sodium methoxide,Wall thickness,Pulp (paper),Paper production","J.

306,Ecological Footprint as a tool for local sustainability: The municipality of Piacenza (Italy) as a case study,2008-01-01,Environmental Impact Assessment Review,10.1016/J.EIAR.2008.07.001,"Abstract The Ecological Footprint is a synthetic index useful to assess sustainability of anthropic systems. Its operational use, however, has been hampered by some difficulties, especially at a local scale. Being conceived as a measure of the biologically productive area requested to sustain individual consumptions in a human community, it leaves out the impacts associated to economic activities. Accordingly, the index cannot contribute much to define local policies, whose target are economic activities, and only marginally affect citizens' behaviour. Ecological Footprint calculation scheme can be modified to include the depletion of natural capital due to local activities such as industry, agriculture, tertiary sector, transport, waste and water management. We provide here an approach which takes into account these different aspects, while we discuss its application to a municipal area as a case study.","Tertiary sector of the economy,Sustainability,Natural capital,Local scale,Environmental science,Environmental resource management,Environmental planning,Environmental index,Ecological footprint,Agriculture,Landfill gas utilization,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas accounting,Global warming,Environmental science,Effects of global warming,Weak and strong sustainability,Sustainable development,Sustainability science,Sustainability,Population,Per capita,Primary production,Forest ecology,Environmental science,Planet,Environmental science,Agroforestry,Throughput accounting,Sustainability,Natural capital accounting,Negative carbon dioxide emission,Environmental science,Environmental chemistry,Sustainability,Overshoot (population),Natural capital,Terms of trade,Sustainable development,Sustainability","Marco Scotti,Cristina Bondavalli,Antonio Bodini,K.

307,Multi-objective optimization of rainfed and irrigated agricultural areas considering production and environmental criteria: a case study of wheat production in Spain,2016-01-01,Journal of Cleaner Production,10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2016.06.099,"Meeting the growing food demand with minimum impact on the environment is a major challenge to face for ensuring a more sustainable food production. To tackle this problem, in this article we present a novel systematic method for agriculture planning that optimally allocates rainfed and irrigated cropping areas, thereby enhancing food availability and reducing the environmental impact of agriculture. The allocation problem is mathematically formulated as a multi-objective linear programming problem that simultaneously accounts for the maximisation of the crop production and the minimisation of the environmental impact caused by water consumption. To quantify the environmental damage, life cycle assessment principles and water footprint concepts are integrated into the model. The capabilities of our tool are illustrated through its application to a real case study that considers wheat production in Spain. The results show that the current allocation of rainfed and irrigated wheat areas in Spain is sub-optimal. Our tool provides a set of alternatives for optimally reallocating these wheat areas that ultimately achieve significant reductions in environmental impact while maintaining or even increasing the production level. The analysis clearly demonstrates that the optimal allocation of rainfed and irrigated cropping areas is a potential pathway to minimise the environmental impact of water consumption in food production. Our systematic decision-support tool aims to assist famers and policy-makers in the transition towards a more sustainable agricultural sector.","Water use,Multi-objective optimization,Life-cycle assessment,Food processing,Environmental resource management,Environmental impact of agriculture,Environmental impact assessment,Economics,Cropping,Agriculture,Underpinning,Planetary boundaries,Planet,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Radiative forcing,Planetary boundaries,Operations research,Multiple-criteria decision analysis,Multi-objective optimization,Valuation (finance),Strengths and weaknesses,Strategic environmental assessment,Multi-objective optimization,Mathematical optimization,Computer science,Water use,Water transport,Water supply,Water use,Water pollution,Water balance,Water use,Water supply,Life-cycle assessment,Water supply,Water resources,Water resource management","Ángel Galán-Martín,Pavel Vaskan,Assumpció Antón,Laureano Jiménez Esteller,Will Steffen,Katherine Richardson,Johan Rockström,Sarah E.

308,Evaluating pest-regulating services under conservation agriculture: A case study in snap beans,2016-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2016.09.032,"Abstract Although conservation agriculture (CA) practices including strip-tillage (ST) and cover cropping are promoted largely for their potential benefits for soil quality, uncertainty surrounding their short-term effects on pests often constrains adoption. Quantification of ecosystem services or dis-services associated with pests is an important step in identifying research and policy priorities for improving the performance of CA practices. Using insect, weed and yield data from snap beans in a three year vegetable rotation, we estimated the value of pest-regulating services associated with the adoption of CA, and compared it to establishment and management costs associated with implementing CA. Experimental factors included tillage (full-width tillage [FWT] or ST), cover crops (winter rye [R] or none [NR]) and weed management intensity (low or high). The value of pest-regulating services associated with adoption of CA practices was estimated based on pesticide cost savings associated with reductions in pest densities given action thresholds typical of commercial snap bean production in the North Central United States. CA practices had no detectable impact on snap bean yields relative to FWT-NR, but resulted in significant tradeoffs in weed and insect abundance. For example, in at least one of two years, ST-R had lower densities of potato leafhopper, Powell amaranth and winter annual weeds, but greater densities of tarnished plant bug and large crabgrass compared to FWT-NR. CA practices had variable effects on natural enemies including ladybeetles, spiders and parasitoids, with no consistent impacts relative to FWT-NR. We estimated that CA practices resulted in net pest-regulating dis-services with costs of $33 ha−1 for FWT-R, $25 ha−1 for ST-NR, and $14 ha−1 for ST-R. Under partial adoption of CA (ST-NR), pest-related costs were completely offset by savings in tillage costs, resulting in estimated short-term increases in net returns of $26 ha−1. In contrast, complete adoption of CA (ST-R) resulted in greater pest and cover crop management costs that outweighed savings due to reduced tillage, resulting in estimated short-term losses of $165 ha−1. In production systems for which effective, low-cost pesticides are unavailable (e.g. low-income countries) or prohibited (e.g. organic systems), the economic impact of pest regulation services is likely to be greater than our estimates suggest. Although CA practices provide several potential long-term ecosystem services at both the farm and landscape level, short-term impacts on pests and yields relative to the costs of implementation are likely to be the major determinant of grower adoption.","Weed control,Weed,Tillage,Soil quality,Ecosystem services,Economic impact analysis,Cover crop,Conservation agriculture,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Sustainable agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation,Sustainability,No-till farming,Intensive farming,Total human ecosystem,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Environmental resource management,Tillage,Soil organic matter,No-till farming,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Soil governance,Sorghum,Soil organic matter,Nutrient cycle,Tillage,Strip-till,No-till farming,Tadarida brasiliensis,Predation,Pest control,Ecosystem services,Ecosystem health,Ecosystem","D.C.

The economics has been worked out by comparing costs and returns at different stages by the conventional method. The linear production function has been fitted to evaluate the resources-use efficiency in the production of menthol mint. The study has shown that the major portion of operational cost is shared by hired labour, interculture operations, distillation charges, irrigation and machine / tractor charge. The overall benefit-cost ratio has been found to be 2.55, which indicates a higher profit for farmers on less investment in mint cultivation. The independent variables like human labour, machinery, manures and fertilizer, irrigation charges and intercultural operations have shown a positive and significant impact on the returns of mentha crop in the study area. The major problems faced by the farmers are high input cost, erratic supply of electricity, lack of adequate information, infrastructural facilities, regulated markets and energy-efficient distillation units.","Tractor,Profitability index,Profit (economics),Non-invasive ventilation,Menthol,Irrigation,Fertilizer,Economics,Biotechnology,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Market price,Innovation adoption,Farmyard manure","Sanjay Kumar,Ram Suresh,Virendra Singh,A.K.

310,Environmental sustainability of traditional foods: the case of ancient apple cultivars in Northern Italy assessed by multifunctional LCA,2013-01-01,Journal of Cleaner Production,10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2013.03.029,"Abstract The marketing strategy for traditional food products is often based around their strong connection with their production region and claims of a lower environmental impact due to being grown in the agricultural area for which they were selected. Such traditional foods often comprise ancient cultivars that are unsuitable for large-scale distribution, but generally require less agricultural inputs. However, specific environmental evaluations of ancient cultivars in comparison with commercial cultivars are very rare. This study investigated ancient apple cultivars in Piemonte (Northern Italy) as a case study of traditional food in the framework of sustainable food production. The production of three representative apple cultivars, Grigia di Torriana, Magnana and Runse, from Torino and Cuneo provinces was investigated using LCA methodology. In particular, the environmental impacts of these cultivars were compared with those of the commercial cultivar Golden Delicious. The study was performed in accordance with ISO 14040 standards, using the cradle-to-gate approach and the EDIP assessment method. Three different functional units were considered: the production of 1 t of fruit, the growth of 1 ha of orchard, and the earning of €1000 income by the grower. Considering impacts per tonne of product, Golden Delicious had the best environmental performance in most impact categories investigated. However, considering impacts per hectare and €1000 income, the ancient cultivars had the best environmental performance in almost all impact categories. As the impacts of fruit production depended heavily on the functional unit chosen, it is not possible to directly recommend which cultivar should be grown to increase the environmental sustainability. However, the results obtained regarding environmental efficiency and sustainability could be included together with other parameters to make a systemic assessment of different cultivars, which could be useful for policymakers, growers and other stakeholders.","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Orchard,Life-cycle assessment,Hectare,Environmental resource management,Environmental impact assessment,Economics,Cultivar,Agronomy,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Product category,Life-cycle assessment,Food products,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Product certification,Terms of trade,Sustainability,Stock and flow,Life-cycle assessment,Integrated farming,Environmental planning,Soil quality,Mixed farming,Life-cycle assessment,World trade,Sustainability,Supply chain,Statistics,Product life-cycle management,Pesticide,Risk assessment,Risk analysis (business),Life-cycle assessment,Sustainable development,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Sustainability,Life-cycle assessment,Food processing","Alessandro K.

311,International trade related food miles – The case of Canada,2012-01-01,Food Policy,10.1016/J.FOODPOL.2012.01.002,"At the beginning of the 21st century imports of agricultural and food commodities have become a major part of many nations’ food baskets. Indeed the global food system has several merits for nations, businesses and individual consumers’ well-being. However, as increasing evidence suggests that we are approaching an era of climate change and scarcity of cheap energy sources the sustainability of that system must be examined. One part of any food commodity chain is its ‘food miles’ – the distance the commodity travels from point of production to point of consumption, the required energy and resulting emissions. This paper presents a 1 year ‘snapshot’ of Canada’s total import related food miles. It presents an analysis of the distance imported foods traveled from around the world to major points of consumption in Canada and documents the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions related to those imports. It presents both a macro scale picture of the equivalent emissions related to transportation of imported food and a micro scale picture which focuses on specific commodities consumed in various parts of the country. It then discusses policy implications for food sustainability. Overall the research highlights that about 30% of the agricultural and food commodities consumed in Canada are imported, resulting in ‘food miles’ of over 61billiontonneskm, leading to annual emissions of 3.3 million metric tonnes of CO2. Of the various agriculture and food commodities studied, fruits and vegetables had the highest food miles related emissions.","Sustainability,Food systems,Food security,Food policy,Food miles,Food industry,Economics,Commodity chain,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Trade barrier,Kyoto Protocol,International trade,Greenhouse gas,Food processing,Food miles,Recession,Physics,Peak oil,Tonne,Sensitivity analyses,Pollutant,Kyoto Protocol,Intermediate consumption,Greenhouse gas,Sustainability,Livestock,Greenhouse gas,Water transport,Transport engineering,Renewable energy,Technical note,Input/output,Goods and services,Sustainable transport,Subsidy,Per capita,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Socioeconomics","Meidad Kissinger,Glen P.

Based on the secondary data spanning from 1980-81 to 2006-07, the deviations of farm harvest prices from the MSP have been used as a measure of ineffectiveness and the impact of prices and technology on rice productivity has been examined by using the simultaneous equation model. While the MSP policy has been very effective in surplus producing states like Punjab and Andhra Pradesh, it has not been so effective in the deficit states. In Punjab, the effective implementation of the price policy has helped in improving the production and productivity of rice. Non-price factors such as use of improved varieties, availability of assured irrigation at subsidized rates and high fertilizer-use have been found to be significant determinants of growth in rice production. The study has suggested that without losing sight of the environmental concerns, the Punjab model can be used for increasing the production of rice in other potential areas of the country.","Subsidy,Simultaneous equations model,Price support,Price policy,Non-invasive ventilation,Irrigation,Economics,Biotechnology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Price policy,Equity (finance),Economics","Shayequa Z.

321,Climate change impacts and adaptation in the agricultural sector: the case of smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe.,2008-01-01,Journal of Sustainable Development in Africa,,"This paper discusses the findings of the research study that was carried out in Zimbabwe among predominantly smallholder farmers on their knowledge of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies. The main aim of the research was to assess climate change and weather issues of relevance to smallholder farmers’ activities, views and knowledge about climate change, its impacts and adaptation strategies. These farmers are vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to their marginal location, low levels of technology, and lack of other essential farming resources. The paper utilizes information from interviews of agricultural extension officers, desk-based research, literature review, and questionnaire surveys administered to smallholder farmers in Murowa Ward, Zvishavane district. The majority of farmers indicated that prolonged wet, hot, and dry weather conditions affect the efficient use of their resources and investment decisions. Some specific impacts of these conditions include, among others, crop damage, death of livestock, soil erosion, bush fires, poor plant germination, pests, lower incomes, and deterioration of infrastructure. Some farmers professed ignorance about climate change and how it will affect their future farming activities. Other farmers pointed out high frequency and severity of drought, excessive precipitation, drying up of rivers, dams and wells, and changes in timing and pattern of seasons as evidence of climate change. Suggested adaptation strategies include strengthening and improving indigenous land and water management practices, use of decision support tools, such as seasonal weather forecast data, growing drought resistant crops, improving indigenous animal breeds, and development of irrigation infrastructure. It is, therefore, concluded that there is need to conscientise farmers about climate change and design adaptation strategies that take into cognizance existing local level knowledge and practices on land and water management. There is also need to avail agricultural research results relevant to the small holder farmers and train them on how to use the results to make informed on-farm investment decisions.","Natural resource economics,Livestock,Investment decisions,Indigenous,Environmental resource management,Environmental impact assessment,Effects of global warming,Climate change,Business,Agriculture,Agricultural extension,Vulnerability,Subsistence economy,Subsistence agriculture,Precipitation,Meteorology,Land cover,Public policy,Micro level,Global environmental analysis,Trend surface analysis,Precipitation,Percentile,Political economy of climate change,Liberian dollar,Geography,Vulnerability,Poverty,Political economy of climate change,Geography,Climatology,Climate change,Physical geography,Geography,Economic history,Resource management,Nutrient management,Nutrient,Social impact,Risk assessment,Poverty","V.

Out-migration, aversion to working in agriculture and the aging of farmers and farm managers are serious problems that raise questions about who will work in agriculture in the future. This paper aims to investigate factors that affect the decisions of agricultural students from Altai Krai to out-migrate or to return to their rural parental municipalities after finishing their university studies. We conducted a questionnaire survey of students at the Altai State Agrarian University in Barnaul and analyzed their migration intentions using a logit regression model. Migration motivation is studied in relation to personal and family background characteristics, employment expectations and quality of life, with a particular focus on references to agriculture. Our results show that the probability of leaving the parental municipality decreases if i) the respondent's parents support the study of agriculture, ii) the respondent's family owns agricultural land, iii) the respondent intends to work in agriculture, and iv) the respondent believes that it is not difficult to establish one's own business in the parental municipality. Women are more likely than men to leave their rural parental municipalities, and the probability of out-migration increases as respondents' life satisfaction increases. Our findings indicate that agricultural roots in the respondent's family stimulate young university graduates to return home and continue in the family tradition. Some of the factors that push young people, especially women, to out-migrate to cities (such as territorial isolation or the social roles of rural women) may be changed only over a long-term period. The recovery or enhancement of relationships between agricultural schools and agricultural enterprises, access to credits for business establishment and the purchase of agricultural land, and better living conditions in rural municipalities could encourage agriculturally educated youth to remain in rural areas and work in agriculture.","Socioeconomics,Rural youth,Rural area,Respondent,Questionnaire,Life satisfaction,Economics,Agriculture,Agricultural land,Agrarian society,Variance inflation factor,Variables,Statistics,Statistics,Segmented regression,Regression diagnostic,Zoning,Rural settlement,Rural area,Sociology,Social science,Social class,Self-employment,Rural economics,Rural area,Two step,Economics,Economic growth,Urbanization,Socioeconomics,Social mobility,Sympathy,Sociology,Social science,Socioeconomics,Social mobility,Social identity theory,Successor cardinal,Soviet union,Restructuring","Zuzana Bednaříková,Miroslava Bavorová,Elena V.

323,Making the Case for a National Food Strategy in the United States.,2016-01-01,Food and Drug Law Journal,,"Presently, in the United States there is a fair amount of speculation regarding the future of food and agricultural laws and policies, given the recent election of a new president. Based on campaign rhetoric and comments since the election, the next four-to-eight years could signal a dramatic shift in a variety of food policy areas, including specific provisions of the Farm Bill, incentives for local food systems and organic farmers, and conservation on farms. Additionally, the new Administration has been exceedingly vocal about immigration reform, which will have significant impacts on the food and farming sectors. The concept of a national food strategy is not new. Other countries, facing similar food system challenges, have developed national food strategies to address these challenges in a holistic and integrated manner. These strategies represent an acknowledgement that, like the United States, many countries have an uncoordinated set of laws and policies that impact the food system. The creation of a national food strategy is both an effort to understand myriad laws and policies related to the food system, and a means by which to chart a path forward with a clear set of goals and priorities to guide future decision making. Although the United States does not have a national food strategy, it has developed national strategies in response to other issues of national concern, such as antibiotic-resistant bacteria or HIV/AIDS, where a coordinated response was needed. While the incoming Administration's food and agricultural policies remain uncertain, the creation of a national strategy can address many existing food system regulatory challenges. Such a strategy could be created in one of two ways. First, the incoming Administration can commit to a national food strategy that may comprehensively address, prioritize, and set goals related to many of the issues important to American voters, including public health, the economy, immigration, the environment, and trade. Alternatively, stakeholders can begin the process--as they have done internationally--to develop their own strategy to present to the next Administration. This Article argues that either of these outcomes is superior to the status quo, yet concludes a national food strategy in the United States will ultimately require governmental engagement to achieve the benefits of long-term, coordinated food system law and policy making.","Public economics,Political science,Marketing,International law,Immigration reform,Good agricultural practice,Food systems,Food security,Food safety,Food policy,Economic growth,Agriculture,Medicine,Governance system,Food science","Laurie J.

Consequently, there are no formal interventions that seek to encourage people to use traditional vegetables as sources of essential nutrients. Studies on the role of wild leafy vegetables in food security could provide important information for development of policies on careful exploitation of natural resources for human sustenance. The objective of this study was to provide a rapid assessment of general knowledge about wild leafy vegetables among subsistence farmers from Ezigeni, a rural location in South Africa, and to determine the availability of wild leafy vegetables from cropping fields during spring - before the cropping season started. A focus group discussion and transect walk were used to collect qualitative data on knowledge of traditional vegetables. Availability of wild leafy vegetables was quantified using one-square-meter plots, randomly located in a cropping field and in an area that has never been cultivated (veld). Results showed that knowledge of wild leafy vegetables among the participants was positively correlated with age. Education status improved knowledge of wild vegetables for middle-aged participants, but not for the youth (35 years or younger). Availability of wild edible leafy vegetables (plant numbers and yield) increased from August to October, but there was a significant difference between species. Data from a focus group discussion showed that wild leafy vegetable availability occurred early in spring, when traditional crops were less abundant. It is concluded that knowledge of wild leafy vegetables may be lost in the near future, unless efforts are made to educate younger generations about their importance. They could be used as an important source of nutrients during the pre-cropping season, before traditional crops are available for human consumption. It is recommended that agronomic investigations into cultivation of wild leafy vegetables that are adapted to rural areas where exotic leafy vegetables are not widely available be undertaken. Those studies could contribute significantly in government policies to improve food security in rural areas, and in the improvement of wild vegetable status, whose potential as sources of nutrition is currently undervalued.

We explored potential causes and consequences of this process on land-use change, grassland farming, and biodiversity and proposed a regional agri-environment scheme (AES) to mitigate the impacts of the decline of traditional farming. Our results demonstrate that the number of traditional small farms strongly declines, being replaced by modern and larger farms. Despite previous studies showing a close relationship between this process and loss in grassland area, total meadow area does not change over the study period as modern farms progressively acquire the land formerly managed by traditional farms. Traditional farming systems are characterized by lower degree of specialization and use more environmentally friendly farming practices than modern systems. Importantly, our results indicate that the decline of traditional farming appears to be largely irreversible because it is closely linked to a broader process of social transformation. To mitigate this decline, we propose an AES that compensates farmers for keeping lower production of organic fertilizers at the farm scale and for maintaining the extensive management of steep meadows at the field scale. The proposed AES demonstrates to be positively related to both plant and insect diversity and might be easily implemented in future agri-environmental policy.

326,Integrated modeling framework for assessment and mitigation of nitrogen pollution from agriculture: Concept and case study for China,2010-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2009.12.004,"Agriculture is a major source of water, air and soil pollution. Pollution rates are often linked to intensification of agricultural activities, i.e., large-scale livestock production and excessive fertilization of crops. In this paper, we develop a concept of a spatially and temporally explicit model for sustainable agriculture production planning, which operates at a detailed spatial scale and integrates demand and agricultural production activities at national and sub-national levels. It distinguishes environmental loads and sources of agricultural pollution originating from two main agricultural activities: livestock raising and crop production. The indicators used to reflect the impacts of agricultural production comprise of fluxes to air (emissions of ammonia and nitrous oxide) and water (nitrate leaching). Possible domains of the indicator variables are subdivided into sub-domains of different impact severity classes. Risk functions indicate the degree of risk associated with agricultural production, similar to fuzzy logic approaches. Alternative production scenarios are compared in terms of human exposure to risk, i.e., the number of people in different risk classes. In this way the model allows for assessment and testing of strategies for mitigating agricultural pollution. Application of the integrated model is illustrated by a case study of agricultural production development in China. China is of global importance due to its huge size and is of scientific interest due to its heterogeneity. Experience gained from the case study can be used for similar research in other regions.","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Production planning,Pollution,Nutrient pollution,Natural resource economics,Ecology,Biology,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural pollution,Urban agglomeration,The Renaissance,Returns to scale,Surface water,Reactive nitrogen,Pelagic zone,Total organic carbon,Road networks,Pollutant,Operations research,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas,Vegetation,Soil water,Population,Sociology,Population,Nitrogen fertilizer,Population,Nitrogen cycle,Nitrogen,Pollutant,Nitrous oxide,Nitrogen,Unified Soil Classification System,Soil survey,Soil science,Soil water,Nitrous oxide,Meteorology","G.

327,Aquaculture effects on environmental and public welfare - the case of Mediterranean mariculture.,2011-01-01,Chemosphere,10.1016/J.CHEMOSPHERE.2011.07.015,"Abstract Aquatic farming has been considered, during the last decades, as the fastest growing food production industry powered by governmental and technological impulsion. Compensation for fisheries decline, creation of new jobs and source of financial windfall are the most important benefits. However, similar to most of the human food-production activities, aquaculture raised several issues related to the environmental welfare and consumer safety. An effort to record the aquaculture-environment and -human safety interactions with regard to the Mediterranean mariculture, is attempted herein. We focused on this geographical area due to its individualities in both the hydrological and physicochemical characteristics and the forms of aquaculture activities. The cage farming of euryhaline marine fish species and more recently of bluefin tuna and mollusk farming are the dominating aquaculture activities. The impacts of these activities to the environment, through wastes offloads, introduction of alien species, genetic interactions, disease transfer, release of chemicals, use of wild recourses, alterations of coastal habitats and disturbance of wildlife, are analytically considered. Also the consumer safety issues related to the farming are assessed, including generation of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, contaminants transferred to humans though food chain and other hazards from consumption of aquacultured items. Within these, the major literature findings are critically examined and suggestions for scientific areas that need further development are made. The major tasks for future aquaculture development in this region are: (i) to ensure sustainability and (ii) to balance the risks to public or environmental health with the substantial economical benefits. In regard with monitoring, tools must be created or adapted to predict the environmental costs and estimate consumer impact. At a canonistic and legal basis, the establishment of appropriate legal guidelines and common policies from all countries involved should be mandatory.","Sustainability,Organic aquaculture,Natural resource economics,Mariculture,Food processing,Food chain,Fishery,Environmental impact assessment,Environmental chemistry,Chemistry,Aquaculture,Agriculture,Waste management,Soil Pollutants,Sewage,Organic aquaculture,Offshore aquaculture,Fishing industry,Human pathogen,Human health,Fish products,Salmonidae,Oncorhynchus,Human health,Toxicology,Toxicity,Polybrominated diphenyl ethers,Percnon gibbesi,Mediterranean climate,Lessepsian migration,Public health,Psychological intervention,Human health,Siltation,Seagrass,Marine ecosystem,Spatial distribution,Phylum,Mediterranean sea,Tylosin,Sorption,Soil water","K.

The agricultural water-use efficiency is a critical indicator that reflects the effective water allocation and water productivity improvement among different agricultural sectors. Taking the Heihe River Basin as the case study area, this study explores the changing trajectories of agricultural water use based on the input–output data of 2003–2012, and estimates the water-use efficiency with Data Envelopment Analysis, Malmquist Total Productivity Index and the decomposition of total factor productivity. Further, the influence of driving factors on the water-use efficiency is analyzed with the Tobit model. The research results indicate that the average agricultural water-use efficiency in different counties is all lower than 1 during 2003–2012, indicating that there is still improvement space in the agricultural water-use efficiency. In addition, there is obvious heterogeneity in the agricultural water-use efficiency among different counties, especially prior to 2009. The research results from the Tobit model indicate that agricultural investment and production, economic growth, industrial restructuring and agricultural plants structural adjustment have significant influence on the agricultural water-use efficiency. The research results can provide significant references for agricultural water-use management in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin and other similar regions in Northwest China.","Water-use efficiency,Water resource management,Water conservation,Total factor productivity,Tobit model,Geology,Farm water,Driving factors,Data envelopment analysis,Agriculture,Geography,Ecosystem diversity,Ecosystem,Water resources,Urbanization,Social change,Water-use efficiency,Surface irrigation,Irrigation statistics,Water scarcity,Water resources,Water conservation,Technical progress,Sustainable development,Productivity,Precipitation,Meteorology,Mathematics,Wastewater,Waste management,Scheduling (production processes),Watershed management,Water resources,Surface water,Water balance,Vegetation,Surface runoff,Statistical hypothesis testing,Scarcity,Reliability (statistics)","Guofeng Wang,Jiancheng Chen,Feng Wu,Zhihui Li,Kumar Duraiappah,Naeem,S.,Wri,Millennium Ecosystems Assessment Board,Klaus Hubacek,Dabo Guan,John Barrett,Thomas Wiedmann,Huixiao Wang,Lu Zhang,W.R Dawes,Changming Liu,Mohamed Taher Kahil,Ariel Dinar,Jose Albiac,Meiting Fan,Shuai Shao,Lili Yang,Baofu Li,Yaning Chen,Xun Shi,Zhongsheng Chen,Weihong Li,Katerina Valta,Tatjana Kosanovic,Dimitris Malamis,Konstantinos Moustakas,Maria Loizidou,YanYun Nian,Xin Li,Jian Zhou,XiaoLi Hu,Xiangzheng Deng,Qingling Shi,Qian Zhang,Chenchen Shi,Fang Yin,Jiandong Chen,Malin Song,Long Xu",http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PCE....89....3W/abstract,29,agriculture case study greenhouse gas
329,Testing and educating on urban soil lead: a case of Chicago community gardens.,2010-01-01,"The Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development",10.5304/JAFSCD.2010.012.015,"Chicago has many urban agricultural projects that provide a source of local food for city dwellers. Urban garden soil, however, may contain lead pollution, and soil quality can vary dramatically from location to location. Soil testing and access to information should improve gardeners’ abilities to grow food safely in urban soils, and to know if time-consuming or expensive measures to avoid lead exposure or enrich the soil are really necessary for their gardens. Soil quality including lead levels was profiled in 10 Chicago gardens. Gardens growing food within raised beds were compared to gardens growing food without raised beds. We also quantified lead in adjacent areas of bare soil or where children might play. Soil lead was measured in two ways: through acid digestion with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 3050B method and a Mehlich-III extraction. The overall mean soil lead level reported through the EPA method was 135 parts per million (n=86), with a range from 10 parts per million to 889 parts per million in individual soil samples. The average for the Mehlich-III method was 63 parts per million. Lead levels in most gardens were not a concern, although gardens contained excessive fertility. Use of raised beds reduced lead levels and thus the potential risk of lead ingestion from plant uptake, but further study comparing the use of raised beds with a greater number of gardens is required. Higher lead levels in soil from nearby areas suggest the possibility of contamination to raised beds and supports the notion that areas with bare soil adjacent to gardens may be an equal or greater source of risk. Our results suggest that the Mehlich-III soil test was positively correlated with the more costly EPA test and could be developed as less expensive test easily conducted by commer­cial soil-testing labs. Additionally, a training pro­gram about urban garden safety with live and online options was created and evaluated with questionnaires given to Master Gardeners. Both live-trained and online-trained groups’ quiz scores improved significantly after the trainings, demonstrating that education about urban soil management can be effective.","Urban agriculture,Soil water,Soil test,Soil quality,Soil management,Soil contamination,Soil classification,Geography,Ecology,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Sorption,Soil water,Organic matter,Web intelligence,Social Semantic Web,Program evaluation,Trace metal,Soil water,Soil classification,Soil water,Respiratory health,Particulates,Urban area,Toxicology,Risk assessment,Water content,Urban environment,Toxicology,Solubility,Soil water,Soil pH,Sociology of leisure,Sociology,Social science,Soil water,Soil test,Soil contamination,Soil water,Soil contamination,Soil conditioner","Laura Witzling,Michelle Wander,Ellen Phillips,Jurate Kumpiene,Anders Lagerkvist,Christian Maurice,Heidi S.

330,Solar radiation management impacts on agriculture in China: A case study in the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP),2014-01-01,Journal of Geophysical Research,10.1002/2013JD020630,"Geoengineering via solar radiation management could affect agricultural productivity due to changes in temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. To study rice and maize production changes in China, we used results from 10 climate models participating in the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) G2 scenario to force the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop model. G2 prescribes an insolation reduction to balance a 1% a−1 increase in CO2 concentration (1pctCO2) for 50 years. We first evaluated the DSSAT model using 30 years (1978–2007) of daily observed weather records and agriculture practices for 25 major agriculture provinces in China and compared the results to observations of yield. We then created three sets of climate forcing for 42 locations in China for DSSAT from each climate model experiment: (1) 1pctCO2, (2) G2, and (3) G2 with constant CO2 concentration (409 ppm) and compared the resulting agricultural responses. In the DSSAT simulations: (1) Without changing management practices, the combined effect of simulated climate changes due to geoengineering and CO2 fertilization during the last 15 years of solar reduction would change rice production in China by −3.0 ± 4.0 megaton (Mt) (2.4 ± 4.0%) as compared with 1pctCO2 and increase Chinese maize production by 18.1 ± 6.0 Mt (13.9 ± 5.9%). (2) The termination of geoengineering shows negligible impacts on rice production but a 19.6 Mt (11.9%) reduction of maize production as compared to the last 15 years of geoengineering. (3) The CO2 fertilization effect compensates for the deleterious impacts of changes in temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation due to geoengineering on rice production, increasing rice production by 8.6 Mt. The elevated CO2 concentration enhances maize production in G2, contributing 7.7 Mt (42.4%) to the total increase. Using the DSSAT crop model, virtually all of the climate models agree on the sign of the responses, even though the spread across models is large. This suggests that solar radiation management would have little impact on rice production in China but could increase maize production.","Solar radiation management,Radiative forcing,Precipitation,Geology,DSSAT,Climatology,Climate model,Climate change,Atmospheric sciences,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Physics,Meteorology,Earth system science,Growing season,Geography,Food prices,Upwelling,Thermohaline circulation,Sea surface temperature,Transient climate simulation,Sea ice,Meteorology,Systems engineering,Software design,Software,Solar radiation management,Greenhouse gas,Global warming,Special Report on Emissions Scenarios,Socioeconomics,Population,Water content,Human fertilization,Environmental science,Representative Concentration Pathways,Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project,Global warming,Troposphere,Shortwave,Physics","Lili Xia,Alan Robock,Jason Cole,Charles L.

But, how resilient are traditional knowledge systems? We explore the resilience of the traditional agricultural knowledge system of home gardeners in the Iberian Peninsula (n = 383). We use multivariate analysis to explore the co-existence of agricultural information derived from two different knowledge systems: (i) knowledge and use of landraces (representative of traditional agricultural knowledge) and (ii) knowledge and use of commercial crop varieties (representative of modern agricultural knowledge). Our analyses show a positive association between both types of knowledge: overall gardeners who are more knowledgeable about commercial crop varieties are also more knowledgeable about landraces. Despite this overall tendency, results from hierarchical cluster analysis showed different groups of traditional and modern knowledge holders. Our results suggest that (a) traditional knowledge is not a frozen and static corpus of knowledge and (b) modern and traditional agricultural knowledge are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Both maintenance of some aspects of the traditional knowledge and incorporation of some aspect of the modern knowledge seem to be core elements of home gardeners’ body of agricultural knowledge which is constantly evolving in response to changing environmental and socioeconomic conditions. Changes in traditional knowledge can be seen as a part of the general self-organizing process of this knowledge system.","Traditional knowledge GIS,Traditional knowledge,Socioeconomic status,Psychological resilience,Peninsula,Knowledge-based systems,Environmental resource management,Economics,Descriptive knowledge,Agriculture,Socio-ecological system,Social network,Social learning,Traditional knowledge GIS,Traditional knowledge,Resource management,Social network,Psychological resilience,Information flow (information theory),Traditional knowledge,Sociology of scientific knowledge,Social science,Sociology,Socioeconomic status,Social science,Vulnerability,Sustainability,Psychological resilience,Socio-ecological system,Psychological resilience,Perception,Total human ecosystem,Psychological resilience,Environmental resource management,Urbanism,Urban sociology,Urban planning,Traditional knowledge,Sociology,Social research","Victoria Reyes-García,Laura Aceituno-Mata,Laura Calvet-Mir,Teresa Garnatje,Erik Gómez-Baggethun,Juan José Lastra,Ricardo Ontillera,Montserrat Parada,Montserrat Rigat,Joan Vallès,Sara Vila,Manuel Pardo-de-Santayana,Carl Folke,Fikret Berkes,Johan Colding,Carl Folke,Per Olsson,Carl Folke,Fikret Berkes,Arun Agrawal,Barbara Wejnert,F.S.

332,Exploring the spatialities of technological and user re-scripting: the case of decision support tools in UK agriculture,2018-01-01,Geoforum,10.1016/J.GEOFORUM.2017.12.006,"Abstract The use of decision support tools on-farm may help to deliver evidence-based guidance to farmers, helping to improve productivity and prevent environmental degradation. While much research has sought to increase the uptake of decision support tools in practice, largely by identifying desirable characteristics of system design, rather little work has used a spatial lens to investigate how they are actually used. Using Latour’s notion of ‘the script’, this paper looks at the spatialities of technological and user re-scripting associated with the introduction of decision support tools on-farm. Although there is some literature on how technologies may be re-scripted by users, studies concerning decision support tools are more limited. Furthermore, while there are studies about how technology (not decision support tools) re-scripts agricultural societies, these are generally concerned with macro-level impacts (e.g. labour changes), rather than exploring life on individual farms. This paper, therefore, focuses on exploring the spatialities of re-scripting, investigating how tools themselves are co-constituted in various ways by different users in different spaces, but more particularly on how life on the farm may be changed by the introduction of decision tools. A case study of decision support tool use on farms in England and Wales demonstrates the need to explore spaces on individual farms if we wish to understand processes occurring at the interface between tools and farmers. Firstly, situated knowledge held by farmers and advisers leads to resistance, negotiation, and re-scripting of decision support tools, which are perceived to provide the ‘view from nowhere’. Secondly, the introduction of decision support tools changes the workflows of farmers, affecting how and when they interact with different spaces of their farm. In signalling the need for more research to theorise the spatialities of re-scripting, we briefly explore how our work can inform policy and the development of decision support tools.","Workflow,Social construction of technology,Situated,Scripting language,Negotiation,Knowledge management,Environmental resource management,Environmental degradation,Economics,Decision support system,Agriculture","David C Rose,Carol Morris,Matt Lobley,Michael Winter,William James Sutherland,Lynn Dicks,Jenny Kitzinger,Brian Wynne,David N.

Peri-urban horticulture in the outskirts of Bogota is an important source of vegetables for Colombia's capital city. Based on detailed follow-ups and periodic field measurements an output–input energy balance was performed with the main objective to study the energy use efficiency of those systems. An uncertainty analysis on the input factors and on the energy equivalents was then applied. Over a measurement period of 18-month, the energy use for coriander, lettuce, radish and spinach was investigated, respectively 12.1, 18.8, 6.6 and 10.7 GJ ha−1 were consumed in these cropping systems. Negative balances were observed for all species exception made for spinach where an output:input ratio of 1.16 was found. The two-way uncertainty analysis showed the highest uncertainty for N-based fertilization while no significant effect was observed for seeds in direct sowing crops. Sustainability of peri-urban horticulture around Bogota is compromised not only because of the city expansion but also due to its inefficient energy use. Technical improvements are required to ensure the environmental subsistence of this important sector for the metropolitan area of the city.","Waste management,Urban horticulture,Sustainability,Subsistence agriculture,Peri-urban agriculture,Environmental protection,Engineering,Energy consumption,Energy balance,Cropping,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Uncertainty analysis,Sensitivity analysis,Probability distribution,Waste management,Toxicology,Total cost,Waste management,Rainfed agriculture,Kharif crop,Waste management,Sugar beet,Renewable energy,Specific energy,Seedbed,Irrigation,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Primary energy,Miscanthus,Energy crop,Research needs,Priority areas,Poverty reduction,Soil fertility,Nutrient,Long-term experiment,Renewable resource,Mature technology,Energy source","C.

However, current literature says little about how these export restrictions interact with existing domestic support measures in jointly determining domestic market outcomes. This paper analyzes this interaction by providing a quantitative assessment on how increased spending on agricultural domestic support in China offset the negative effects on grain production caused by the country's export restrictions and how these two types of measures jointly moderated rises of domestic grain prices. In particular, domestic and trade measures on key agricultural inputs such as fertilizers are shown to contribute significantly to expand grain outputs and reduce domestic market prices. While the short-term goal in stabilizing domestic grain prices was achieved through these measures, large fiscal and efficiency costs were incurred, especially considering how the short-term export restrictions seemingly necessitated the extra spending on input-based domestic subsidies. We also demonstrate that the costs to China and the rest of the world of these complicated policy interventions may be partially avoidable with a simpler and less distorting instrument.","Subsidy,Quantitative assessment,International trade,International economics,Economics,Domestic market,Commercial policy,China,Agriculture,Technological change,International trade,History,Valuation (finance),Stylized fact,Macroeconomics,Public policy,Price level,Price controls,Subsidy,Rural poverty,Nonfarm payrolls,Volatility (finance),Supply and demand,Price elasticity of supply,Subsidy,International trade,International economics,Trade barrier,Subsidy,Multilateral trade negotiations,Subsidy,Scatter plot,Microeconomics,Impact assessment,Geography,Food security,World trade,Volatility (finance),Trade barrier","Wusheng Yu,Hans Grinsted Jensen,Thomas W.

Furthermore, a complex interplay of unemployment, rural exodus, and an aging population challenges this structurally weak region. We discuss adaptation measures that are either implemented or planned, as well as research into adaptation strategies to climate change for the sectors forestry, agriculture, and water management as well as in nature conservation in light of socioeconomic and ecological challenges and benefits. In doing so, we adopt a systemic view of Brandenburg where the sectors discussed are seen as subsystems embedded in a larger regional system. This at least partially holarchical approach enables the identification of conflicts between adaptation measures, but also of synergies among the sectors that pertain to successful adaptation to climate change. The insights gained ultimately highlight the need for cross-sectoral, adaptive management practices that jointly target a sustainable regional development.","Unemployment,Sustainable regional development,Socioeconomic status,Population ageing,Environmental resource management,Economics,Ecological systems theory,Climate change,Agriculture,Adaptive management,Vulnerability,Sustainability,Latin Americans,Working group,Vulnerability,Sustainability and systemic change resistance,Public administration,Political science,Group ii,Socio-ecological system,Social network,Social learning,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Top-down and bottom-up design,Socio-ecological system,Social system,Social ecology,Social network,Social capital,Learning environment,Vulnerability,Social system,Social capital,Vulnerability,Social psychology (sociology),Psychological resilience,Strengths and weaknesses,Probabilistic logic,Meteorology","Christopher Reyer,Johann Bachinger,Ralf Bloch,Fred F.

This environmental management issue has received considerable attention because of its applications in urban and rural infrastructure planning, industrial development planning as well as health, housing, transportation and agricultural schemes. This paper explains a method to determine how to locate suitable sites for hazardous waste landfilling area by using the site screening study. It demonstrates how the criteria such as geology, topography, land use, climate, earthquake and other related factors can be introduced into the overlayer technique to determine the suitable site selection in a region. The research was undertaken in the Southeastern Anatolia Project (known as GAP in Turkey) region where identifying the land resources is crucial for agricultural and water management purposes. The paper also explains the validity of the method employed on the site selection process for hazardous wastes.

Vermicomposting organic waste could have dual beneficial effects by generating an economically viable animal feed protein in the form of worm biomass, while alleviating the negative effects of poor organic waste management. In this study, a low-maintenance vermicomposting system was evaluated as manure and food waste management system for small-holder farmers. A vermicomposting system using the earthworm species Eudrilus eugeniae and treating cow manure and food waste was set up in Kampala, Uganda, and monitored for 172 days. The material degradation and protein production rates were evaluated after 63 days and at the end of the experiment. The material reduction was 45.9% and the waste-to-biomass conversion rate was 3.5% in the vermicomposting process on a total solids basis. A possible increase in the conversion rate could be achieved by increasing the frequency of worm harvesting. Vermicomposting was found to be a viable manure management method in small-scale urban animal agriculture; the return of investment was calculated to be 280% for treating the manure of a 450 kg cow. The vermicompost was not sanitised, although hygiene quality could be improved by introducing a post-stabilisation step in which no fresh material is added. The value of the animal feed protein generated in the process can act as an incentive to improve current manure management strategies.","Waste management,Vermicompost,Manure management,Manure,Food waste,Environmental engineering,Cow dung,Chemistry,Biodegradable waste,Animal feed,Agriculture,Software engineering,Software analytics,Reference software,Waste management,Waste hierarchy,Waste disposal,Soil organic matter,Organic farming,No-till farming,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Soil fertility,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Green Revolution,Wastewater,Waste management,Greywater,Wine,Waste management,Toxicology,Waste management,Vermicompost,Sludge,Turbot,Recirculating aquaculture system,Palatability,Soil water,Shoot,Nutrient","Cecilia Helena Lalander,Allan John Komakech,Björn Vinnerås,R Core Team,Perinaz Bhada-Tata,Daniel A.

Environmental impact indicators are increasingly being demanded for policy and decision-making processes. Consumers are more and more concerned about the quality of food products and now looking for those with a low environmental impact, with a particular attention to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There are few studies regarding the GHG emissions associated with the Brazilian soybean production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the main sources of GHG in soybean production in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our analysis considered the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) from cradle to farm gate. We evaluated 55 farms in the crop years of 2007/08, 2008/09 and 2009/10, accounting for 180,000 ha of soybean cultivation area and totaling 114 individual situations. The results indicated that the largest source of GHG in the soybean production is the decomposition of crop residues (36%), followed by fuel use (19%), fertilizer application (16%), liming (13%), pesticides (7%), seeds (8%) and electricity consumed at the farms (","Waste management,Sustainability,Life-cycle assessment,Greenhouse gas,Environmental impact assessment,Economics,Crop yield,Crop residue,Carbon footprint,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Life-cycle assessment,Life cycle thinking,Life cycle inventory,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Per capita,Greenhouse gas,Greenhouse,Renewable energy,Greenhouse gas,Fossil fuel,Land grabbing,Food security,Ecosystem services,Popularity,Multiple forms,Literature survey,Yardstick,Supply and demand,Renewable energy,Tillage,Soil carbon,No-till farming","Guilherme Silva Raucci,Cindy Silva Moreira,Priscila Aparecida Alves,Francisco Fujita de Castro Mello,Leidivan de Almeida Frazão,Carlos Eduardo Pellegrino Cerri,Carlos Clemente Cerri,Hans-Jürgen Klüppel,Jonathan A.

This paper begins by emphasising that, while human population growth may often be loosely linked to terrace construction efforts, the association is by no means a straightforward one. We then argue that the choice of which parts of the landscape to terrace is driven by a range of cultural and environmental priorities that are most usefully explored by a combination of global, local and auto-correlative modelling, as well as via simulation-based methods. The results demonstrate that surficial geology, terrain slope, pre-existing terraces and pre-existing patterns of human habitation are all important structuring features. We also consider terraces as method for soil conservation, question the uncritical use of meso-scale erosion models and argue that patterns of catastrophic soil loss are often overstated in Mediterranean contexts. However, erosion modelling can, if deployed cautiously and comparatively, nonetheless be used to explore ways in which terraces do indeed manage localised soil movement in agriculturally favoured parts of the landscape, with our results suggesting that a substantial proportion of the erosion in this regions is indeed ameliorated by such measures.","Terrain,Structuring,Spatial analysis,Soil conservation,Population growth,Mediterranean climate,Erosion,Ecology,Biology,Agriculture,Statistical analyses,Data set,Data science,Statistical physics,Multiple-try Metropolis,Monte Carlo method in statistical physics,Niche construction,Natural selection,Mathematical and theoretical biology,Statistics,Standardized coefficient,Standard deviation,Spatial econometrics,Spatial ecology,Spatial descriptive statistics,Statistical hypothesis testing,Spatial descriptive statistics,Spatial dependence,Social exclusion,Political ecology,Natural resource,Prehistory,Mediterranean climate,Geography,Topographic map,Terrain,Stream power,Vegetation and slope stability,Surface runoff,Soil water","Andrew Bevan,James Conolly,W.

Therefore, specific measures aimed to control the risk of water pollution by nitrates must be implemented to minimise its impact on the environment and potential risk to human health. The spatial probability distribution of nitrate contents exceeding a threshold or limit value, established within the quality standard, will be helpful to managers and decision-makers. A methodology based on non-parametric and non-linear methods of Indicator Kriging was used in the elaboration of a nitrate pollution categorical map for the aquifer of Vega de Granada (SE Spain). The map has been obtained from the local estimation of the probability that a nitrate content in an unsampled location belongs to one of the three categories established by the European Water Framework Directive: CL. 1 good quality [Min — 37.5 ppm], CL. 2 intermediate quality [37.5–50 ppm] and CL. 3 poor quality [50 ppm — Max]. The obtained results show that the areas exceeding nitrate concentrations of 50 ppm, poor quality waters, occupy more than 50% of the aquifer area. A great proportion of the area's municipalities are located in these poor quality water areas. The intermediate quality and good quality areas correspond to 21% and 28%, respectively, but with the highest population density. These results are coherent with the experimental data, which show an average nitrate concentration value of 72 ppm, significantly higher than the quality standard limit of 50 ppm. Consequently, the results suggest the importance of planning actions in order to control and monitor aquifer nitrate pollution.","Water pollution,Water Framework Directive,Pollution,Nitrate,Kriging,Hydrology,Groundwater pollution,Environmental engineering,Chemistry,Aquifer,Agriculture,Spatial simulation,Software,Histogram,Variogram,Transiogram,Pedometrics,Water resources,Mathematics,Econometrics,Software engineering,Software,Mathematics,Exposure assessment,Environmental science,Environmental health,Water pollution,Septic tank,Pollutant,Water pollutants,Skin color,Pediatrics,Vulnerability assessment,Vadose zone,Nitrate,Vulnerability,Structural basin,State of the Environment,Toxicology,Risk assessment,Risk analysis (engineering)","Mario Chica-Olmo,Juan Antonio Luque-Espinar,Victor Rodriguez-Galiano,Eulogio Pardo-Igúzquiza,Clayton Vernon Deutsch,André Georges Journel,Timothy C.

Significant differences were found in soil fertility status, pests and diseases management, risk and uncertainties, use of agrochemicals and access to social services. No remarkable variations were found in crop diversification, annual agricultural income and food sufficiency. However, uncertainty and risk in agricultural production is relatively low in highland communities. The findings reveal that agriculture production alone is not a viable livelihood option for agricultural watershed communities in Nepal. The households growing crops with hired labour have relatively sustainable livelihoods in Nepal's agricultural watersheds. Insufficient agricultural land, insufficient working manpower within a family, and lack of access to ecological agricultural services are prime factors in being livelihood insecure in agricultural watershed communities. Therefore, long-term policies and plans need to be developed for the empowerment of local farmers and to support rural livelihoods with adaptable and flexible income-generating strategies, resilient resource management institutions and enhancement of knowledge, skills and social capital.","Natural resource,Livelihood,Environmental resource management,Economic security,Chemistry,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural land,Agricultural diversification,Agricultural communication,Sustainable livelihood,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Rural sociology,Sustainable development,Rural sociology,Rural economics,Political science,Natural resource economics,Livelihood,Rural development,Resource conservation,Poverty reduction,Sustainability,Poverty,Political science,Vulnerability,Poverty,Political science,Social reproduction,Social movement,Social capital,Sustainable development,Sustainability science,Sustainability organizations,Sri lanka,South asia,Socioeconomics,Urbanization,Rural development,Poverty","B.S.

In particular, we examined (1) the dynamics of the field systems characteristics in these landscapes and (2) the interrelations with changes in dominant land cover, population and farming systems (in terms of productive structure, land use system and farming practices) dynamics. The picture of the1950s showed mainly semi-openfield field systems and nucleated villages that extended through valleys in the lowland, with banks in rough coastline sectors. In the highlands we found enclosed fields and scattered hamlets interspersed within large extensions of scrubland. In between both systems, a transitional area with mixed characteristics appeared. In 2000, the transitional area expanded from the former semi-openfields and banks areas, while the highlands still retain the enclosed character. The dominant land cover has experienced significant changes throughout the area, following an increase in woodland. A reorientation of the farming system was observed, a shift in which cropland lost importance with regard to grassland, the use of scrubland became marginal and forestry increased. The decrease in the number of farms and livestock shows decline in agricultural activity. This can be closely related to changes in dominant land cover and cropping patterns. Despite recent changes, this area still retains characteristic features of traditional landscapes such as the spatial pattern of field systems and ancestral cultural practices (e.g. extensive grazing of the scrubland).","Woodland,Shrubland,Population,Land use,Land cover,Field system,Ecology,Cultural landscape,Biology,Agriculture,Urbanization,Spatial contextual awareness,Perception,Natural resource economics,Land use,European union,Sustainable management,Strategic Initiative,Rural area,Nature Conservation,Landscape structure,Landscape change,Shrubland,Mediterranean climate,Landscape ecology,Threatened species,Sustainability,Present day,Soil protection,Nature Conservation,Forest resource,Physical geography,Paleoclimatology,Mountain research,Sustainable development,Landscape planning,Landscape history,Rural landscapes,Rural area,Nature Conservation","María Silvia Calvo-Iglesias,Urbano Fra-Paleo,Ramón Alberto Diaz-Varela,Marc Antrop,D.

Following limited successes of state regulation, market actors and mechanisms are increasingly included in the environmental and safety governance of domestic and global food chains and networks. But do such private governance arrangements also work in domestic markets in developing countries? Pesticide use in vegetable supply is taken as a case to explore the role of market actors and dynamics in food safety governance in Vietnam. The so-called safe vegetable production system in the Red River Delta, introduced 10 years ago as a domestic alternative to conventional vegetable production, is analyzed through detailed monitoring of farmers, surveys of retailers and consumers, and in-depth interviews with state officials and vegetable traders. The paper finds limited success of this low-pesticide vegetable production, distribution and consumption system. This private arrangement in food governance lacked trust from market actors (especially consumers), and was short of an active state that organized transparency and got market actors involved. As such, market governance in food safety needs to be strong.","Transparency (graphic),Food safety,Food chain,Environmental resource management,Economy,Economic policy,Domestic market,Developing country,Corporate governance,Consumer economics,Chemistry,Agriculture,Public administration,Political science,Multi-level governance,Tertiary sector of the economy,Restructuring,Pacific Rim,Sociology,Quality information,Public relations,Wine,Pesticide residue,Pesticide,Typology,Sociology,Public relations,Scarcity,Public sector,Public economics,Sustainability,Industrialisation,Food systems,Natural resource economics,Geography,Environmental policy,Marketing,Food systems,Food security,Sustainable development,Political science,Legitimacy","Pham Van Hoi,Arthur P.J.

Rising fuel costs and increasing concerns over the effects of climate change are reinvigorating policymakers’ interest in renewable energy sources such as hydropower and bio-energy—both from biofuels as well as biomass. Development of any of these sources has the potential to generate positive economic and environmental benefits, yet, at the same time, they can cause negative food and equity impacts. This obviously entails major tradeoffs between the food, energy and environmental goals of water and energy development, allocation and management. Using both a brief global overview as well as a closer review of four case studies from India, Ethiopia, Jordon and the USA, this paper tries to (i) a present the nature of the tradeoffs under different hydrological, energy, agricultural and environmental contexts and (ii) provide some anecdotal evidence and illustrative cases for the available policy options for minimizing conflicts but maximizing synergies between water, energy, food and environment.","Natural resource economics,Hydropower,Food energy,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Environmental impact of the energy industry,Energy source,Energy development,Effects of global warming,Economics,Anecdotal evidence,Agriculture,Water resources,Water resource management,Greenhouse gas,Water supply,Water scarcity,Water resources,Water supply,Water resource management,Tributary,Water use,Water supply,Water scarcity,Water use,Water resources,Water resource management,Water supply,Water scarcity,Water resources,Water resource management,Water regulation,Structural basin,Water resource management,Surface water resources,Structural basin","Peter G.

Productive use of bioenergy is an important strategy for rural households to improve not only their income, but also their health, living environment and so on. In Tibet of China, which is rich in cattle dung and firewood as the major energy sources for rural households, the efficiency of energy utilization is just about 10%. In order to improve energy utilization efficiency and the living conditions for rural residents, the Tibet Autonomous Region government introduced residential biogas model (RBM) to local households, which was a comprehensive utilization system of energy integrated with residential biogas digester, vegetable greenhouse and livestock shed. This paper aims to show the productive use of the bioenergy by the RBM, which could be depicted as the feasibility and the benefits on economic, eco-environmental and social aspects of biogas utilization, based on household questionnaires in Panam County. In RBM, biogas digester works as the biomass material supplement loop to transform originally biomass flow from single-direction to recycling-direction. The results indicate that the output of unit biogas digester could replace 1.44Â t of firewood, 1.65Â t of agricultural residues and 1.75Â t of cattle dung, respectively. The net incremental benefit of RBM could reach 5550.72 Yuan in 15 years. The reduced amount of CO2 emission when substituted by biogas in other agricultural areas and the areas of semi-agricultural and semi-husbandry in Tibet could be (76.66-79.89)Â xÂ 104Â t/year and the capability for nitrogen storage could achieve (0.39-0.99)Â xÂ 104Â t/year. The amount of cattle dung replaced by biogas could reach 78.29Â xÂ 104Â t/year; this means that the saved cattle dung, 3.51Â t/hm2, could be reallocated back to cultivated land to improve the soil fertility and to keep the balance of nutrient elements in cultivated land. Biogas utilization reduces the labor opportunity costs of women compared to use of traditional bioenergy sources. It could be concluded that the productive use of bioenergy through RBM in this area has its capability to release the current pressures on biomass sources by adjusting patterns of rural energy consumption, and to improve the conditions of health, environment, economy and energy conservation.","Waste management,Opportunity cost,Firewood,Engineering,Energy source,Energy consumption,Biomass,Biogas,Bioenergy,Agriculture,Waste management,Renewable energy,Market penetration,Socioeconomics,Human Development Report,Engineering ethics,Waste management,Stove,Renewable energy,Stove,Rural area,Poverty,Waste management,Stove,Renewable energy,Sustainable development,Social psychology,Rural health,Waste management,Rural area,Renewable energy,Scarcity,Rural area,Primary energy,Soil fertility,Nutrient cycle,Net Weight,Waste management,Stove,Rural area","Tingting Feng,Shengkui Cheng,Qingwen Min,Wei Li,S.

Virtual water flow (VWF) promotes water redistribution geographically and provides a new solution for resolving regional water shortage and improving water use efficiency in the world. Virtual water transfer among regions will have a significant influence on the water systems in both grain export and import regions. In order to assess the impacts of VWF related grain transfer on regional water resources conditions, the study takes mainland China as study area for a comprehensive evaluation of virtual water flow on regional water resources stress. Results show that Northeast China and Huang-Huai-Hai region are the major grain production regions as well as the major virtual water export regions. National water savings related to grain VWF was about 58 Gm 3 , with 48 Gm 3 blue water and 10 Gm 3 green water. VWF changes the original water distribution and has a significant effect on water resources in both virtual water import and export regions. Grain VWF significantly increased water stress in grain export regions and alleviated water stress in grain import regions. Water stress index (WSI) of Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia has been increased by 138% and 129% due to grain export. Stress from water shortages is generally severe in export regions, and issues with the sustainability of grain production and VWF pattern are worthy of further exploration.","Water-use efficiency,Water scarcity,Water resources,Virtual water,Sustainability,Scarcity,Mainland China,Environmental engineering,Chemistry,Agriculture,Sustainable development,Poverty,Food security,Water use,Water transport,Water supply,Summit,Population,Nationality,Yearbook,Library science,Economics,Water cycle,Snow hydrology,Snow,Water supply,Water scarcity,Water resources,Virtual water,Natural resource economics,Environmental science,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Water resources,Water supply,Water resource management,Water consumption,Virtual water,Nexus (standard),Metaphor","Shikun Sun,Yubao Wang,Bernie A.

The water quality was monitored at nine different sites, along the water line, over a period of 18 months (from January 2006 to May 2007) using 26 water quality parameters. The cluster analysis allowed the formation of five different similarity groups between sampling sites, reflecting differences on the water quality at different locations of the Alqueva reservoir system. The PCA/FA identified six varifactors, which were responsible for 64% of total variance in water quality data set. The principal parameters, which explained the variability of quality water, were total phosphorus, oxidability, iron, parameters that at high concentrations indicate pollution from anthropogenic sources, and herbicides indicative of an intensive agricultural activity.

349,"Botanical pesticide production, trade and regulatory mechanisms in sub-Saharan Africa: making a case for plant-based pesticidal products",2014-01-01,Food Security,10.1007/S12571-014-0343-7,"Pesticides are the major technology used in the management of field and postharvest losses due to pests. There is growing demand for effective alternatives that present low health risks and conserve ecosystems and biological diversity. Pesticidal plants are increasingly used as alternatives where synthetic products are unaffordable, have limited availability or are ineffective. Plant materials, however, are often used inefficiently and their effective use requires optimisation. In Africa wide-scale uptake of pesticidal plants remains limited despite the success of pyrethrum in some countries and other pesticidal plant products in China and India. This is mainly due to lack of data on efficacy and safety, inconsistent efficacy of plant products, the prohibitive cost of registration, and an inadequately developed conventional pesticides sector. Globally, the demand for botanicals is poised to grow due to an increasing shift in consumer demand for safe food, increasing organic farming, lobbying by environmentalists and the increasing pressure from new regulations on internationally traded foods in Europe. These demands can only be met by formalising production, marketing and use of pesticidal plants. This has to be supported by friendly registration procedures, sustainable forest management, propagation and cultivation of pesticidal plants. This paper presents a critical review of the enabling environment required for wide-scale adoption and commercialisation of botanical pesticides in sub-Saharan Africa. We conclude that regulations and protocols for production, marketing and trade need to be reviewed to facilitate the development of the botanicals sector in Africa.","Sustainable forest management,Sub saharan,Pyrethrum,Pesticide,Organic farming,Natural resource economics,Food security,Environmental resource management,Economics,Biodiversity,Agriculture,Pyrethrum,Pesticide,Integrated pest management,Toxicology,Population,Piperonyl butoxide,Warehouse,Sanitation,Pest control,Traditional knowledge,Public health,Pest control,Pest control,Integrated pest management,European union,Public health,Pesticide,Perception,Rotterdam Convention,Revenue,Pesticide,Rapid rate,Pesticide,Pest control,Insect pest management,Biopesticide,Biology,Plutella,PEST analysis,Integrated pest management","P.

350,Functional Land Management for managing soil functions: A case-study of the trade-off between primary productivity and carbon storage in response to the intervention of drainage systems in Ireland,2015-01-01,Land Use Policy,10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2015.03.007,"Globally, there is growing demand for increased agricultural outputs. At the same time, the agricultural industry is expected to meet increasingly stringent environmental targets. Thus, there is an urgent pressure on the soil resource to deliver multiple functions simultaneously. The Functional Land Management framework (Schulte et al., 2014) is a conceptual tool designed to support policy making to manage soil functions to meet these multiple demands. This paper provides a first example of a practical application of the Functional Land Management concept relevant to policy stakeholders. In this study we examine the trade-offs, between the soil functions ‘primary productivity’ and ‘carbon cycling and storage’, in response to the intervention of land drainage systems applied to ‘imperfectly’ and ‘poorly’ draining managed grasslands in Ireland. These trade-offs are explored as a function of the nominal price of ‘Certified Emission Reductions’ or ‘carbon credits’. Also, these trade-offs are characterised spatially using ArcGIS to account for spatial variability in the supply of soil functions. To manage soil functions, it is essential to understand how individual soil functions are prioritised by those that are responsible for the supply of soil functions – generally farmers and foresters, and those who frame demand for soil functions – policy makers. Here, in relation to these two soil functions, a gap exists in relation to this prioritisation between these two stakeholder groups. Currently, the prioritisation and incentivisation of these competing soil functions is primarily a function of CO2 price. At current CO2 prices, the agronomic benefits outweigh the monetised environmental costs. The value of CO2 loss would only exceed productivity gains at either higher CO2 prices or at a reduced discount period rate. Finally, this study shows large geographic variation in the environmental cost: agronomic benefit ratio. Therein, the Functional Land Management framework can support the development of policies that are more tailored to contrasting biophysical environments and are therefore more effective than ‘blanket approaches’ allowing more specific and effective prioritisation of contrasting soil functions.","Sustainability,Soil governance,Soil functions,Land management,Food security,Environmental resource management,Economics,Carbon price,Carbon credit,Agriculture,Geography,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem,Vegetation type,Vegetation,Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands,Sustainability,Food systems,Food security,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Normative,Water content,Soil science,Soil respiration,Technical report,Environmental planning,Engineering ethics,Topsoil,Subsoil,Soil science,Soil water,Soil texture,Organic matter,Vegetation,Trace gas,Soil science,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Soil quality","Lilian O’Sullivan,R.E.

This study evaluated the dynamics and spatial pattern of Mekelle City’s expansion in the past three decades 1984–2014. Multi-temporal Landsat images and Maximum Likelihood Classifier were used to produce decadal land use/land cover LULC maps. Changes in LULC and spatial pattern of urban expansion were analysed by post-classification change detection and spatial metrics, respectively. The results showed that in the periods 1984–1994, 1994–2004, and 2004–2014, the built-up area increased annually by 10%, 9%, and 8%, respectively; with an average annual increment of 19% 100 ha year−1, from 531 ha in 1984 to 3524 ha in 2014. Between 1984 and 2014, about 88% of the gain in built-up area was from conversion of agricultural lands, which decreased by 39%. Extension of existing urban areas was the dominant growth type, which accounted for 54%, 75%, and 81% of the total new development during 1984–1994, 1994–2004, and 2004–2014, respectively. The spatial metrics analyses revealed urban sprawl, with increased heterogeneity and gradual dispersion in the outskirts of the city. The per capita land consumption rate ha per person increased from 0.009 in 1984 to 0.014 in 2014, indicating low density urban growth. Based on the prediction result, the current 2014 built-up area will double by 2035, and this is likely to have multiple socioeconomic and environmental consequences unless sustainable urban planning and development policies are devised.","Urban sprawl,Urban planning,Urban climate,Physical geography,Per capita,Land use,Land cover,Geography,Common spatial pattern,Cartography,Agriculture,Waste disposal,Urbanization,Urban planning,Remote sensing,Principal component analysis,Land cover change detection,Spatial analysis,Soft classification,Sampling scheme,Spatial analysis,Landscape structure,Landscape pattern,Urbanization,Urban planning,Urban geography,Urbanization,Urban sprawl,Urban agglomeration,Urbanization,Urban planning,Time series,Urban sprawl,Urban ecosystem,Urban density,Urbanization,Urban planning,Urban density,Urbanization,Urban sprawl,Spatial distribution","Ayele Almaw Fenta,Hiroshi Yasuda,Nigussie Haregeweyn,Ashebir Sewale Belay,Zelalem Hadush,Mewcha Amha Gebremedhin,Getachew Mekonnen,Nancy B.

The methods, data sets used, and the procedures are demonstrated in a real setting: constructing a sampling design for the first national forest inventory for Tanzania. The approach of the paper constructs a spatial model of forests, landscape, and land use. Sampling errors of the key parameters as well as the field measurement costs of the inventory were estimated using sampling simulation on data. Forests and land use often vary within a country or an area of interest, implying that stratified sampling is an efficient inventory design. Double sampling for stratification was taken for the statistical framework.

In addition to the direct harvesting from plants, biomass is also produced as a by product in many agro based industries such as rice husk from rice mill, saw dust from saw mill, bagasse from sugar mills etc. It has been estimated that about 17 GW of power can be generated through cogeneration, combustion and gasification routes from the available biomass. However, for this potential to be realized, data on production, present usage patterns, prices and seasonal fluctuation on biomass is essentially required. The present article is based on the resource assessment of non-plantation surplus biomass with a view to using it for energy production and its utilization in the state of Haryana, India. Being an agricultural state, Haryana has a huge potential of biomass availability in the form of crop residue and saw dust. In the agricultural sector, a total 24.697 Mt y −1 of residue is generated, of which 71% is consumed in various domestic and commercial activities within the state. While in agro based industrial sector, a total of 646 kt y −1 of sawdust is generated, of which only 6.65% is consumed in the state. Of the total generated biomass in the state, 45.51% is calculated as basic surplus, 37.48% as productive surplus and 34.10% as net surplus. The power generation potential from all these three categories of surplus biomass is 1.499 GW, 1.227 GW and 1.120 GW respectively.","Sawdust,Electricity generation,Crop residue,Cogeneration,Chemistry,By-product,Biomass,Bagasse,Agronomy,Agriculture,Environmental science,Environmental planning,Renewable resource,Renewable energy,Power station,Subsistence agriculture,Rural area,Government,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Renewable energy,Low-carbon economy,Greenhouse gas,Greenhouse effect","Suresh Chauhan,Amulya K.

The survey was conducted during December 2007-January 2008. The results indicate pesticides are readily available and widely used in crop production. This includes the use of endosulfan which has been banned by the Thai government since 2004. Overall, pesticide use was inappropriate. Farmers did not wear suitable personal protection, apply pesticides in an appropriate fashion, or discard the waste safely. They frequently relied on commercial advertisements for the best pesticide to use. Pesticide use patterns among small-scale farmers in Thailand need improvement. Educational interventions are essential for promoting safety during all phases of pesticide handling. Public policies should be developed to encourage farmers to change their pest management methods from chemical based to methods that are healthier and more environmentally friendly.","Public policy,Poison control,Pesticide,Occupational safety and health,Medicine,Integrated pest management,Immunology,Government,Environmental protection,Checklist,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Sustainability,Pesticide,Externality,Social isolation,Pesticide,Medicine,Weed control,Pesticide,Natural enemies,Soil water,Soil pH,Phosphorus,Pesticide application,Pesticide,Metalaxyl,Waste management,Waste disposal,Soil contamination,Soil water,Soil test,Soil conditioner,Plant disease,Pesticide use,Pesticide,Soil contamination,Poison control,Pesticide,Public health,Pollutant,Pesticide","Pinyupa Plianbangchang,Kanchalee Jetiyanon,Sakchai Wittaya-Areekul,Clevo Wilson,Clement Tisdell,Flemming Konradsen,Wim van der Hoek,Donald C.

357,A cost-effective canopy temperature measurement system for precision agriculture: a case study on sugar beet,2017-01-01,Precision Agriculture,10.1007/S11119-016-9470-9,"Increasing agricultural efficiency in a sustainable manner will contribute to feed a growing population under limited land, nutrient and water resources. Water scarcity and the increasing social concern for this resource are already requiring more sophisticated irrigation and decision-support systems. To address the heterogeneity in crop water status in a commercial field, precision irrigation requires accurate information about crops (e.g., crop water status), soil (e.g., moisture content) and weather (e.g., wind speed and vapor pressure deficit). Numerous studies have shown that plant canopy temperature can be used to derive reliable plant water stress indicators, thus making it a promising tool for irrigation water management. However, efficient and cost-effective measurement techniques are still lacking. This paper assesses the potential of infrared thermometry and thermal imaging for monitoring plant water stress in a commercial sugar beet field by comparing canopy temperature data acquired from a conventional thermal camera with an inexpensive infrared sensor, both mounted on a rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Measurements were taken at various phenological stages of the sugar beet growing season. Laboratory tests were performed to determine the key features for accurate temperature measurements and flight altitude. Experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 in experimental and commercial sugar beet fields in Southwestern Spain to (i) develop an affordable infrared temperature system suitable for mounting on a UAV to obtain thermal information, (ii) compare sugar beet canopy temperature measurements collected with the low-cost platform with those obtained from a conventional thermal camera, both mounted on a rotary-wing UAV, (iii) identify the factors that will limit the use of the low-cost system to derive temperature-based water stress indices. To accomplish these objectives, well-watered and deficit irrigated plots were established. Results indicated that the lightweight canopy temperature system was robust and reliable, although there were some constraints related to weather conditions and delimitation of the area covered by the infrared sensor.","Water resources,Water content,Vapour Pressure Deficit,Remote sensing,Precision agriculture,Population,Irrigation,Growing season,Engineering,Canopy,Agronomy,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Robotics,Remote sensing,Processing methods,Workflow,Satellite imagery,Remote sensing,Population growth,Population,Crop yield,Remote sensing,Poison control,Photochemical Reflectance Index,Tomographic reconstruction,Thermography,Plant phenotyping,Winter wheat,Remote sensing,Payload,Time of day,Phenomics,Multiple traits,Weed control,Weed,Technical support,Water stress,Vineyard,Spatial variability","J.

The reform allowed peasants to obtain land titles and consolidate separated land strips into single allotments. We find that consolidations increased land productivity. If the reform had been fully implemented, it would have doubled grain production in the empire. We argue that an important factor determining the positive impact on productivity is a decrease in coordination costs, enabling peasants to make independent production decisions from the village commune. In contrast, the titling component of the reform decreased land productivity and we present evidence that transaction costs explain this short-run decline.","Transaction cost,Land tenure,Land productivity,Empire,Economy,Economics,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Public land,Land use,Land titling,Renting,Peasant,Local factor,Property rights,Land law,Investment incentives,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Standard of living,Reinterpretation,Population,Voting behavior,Voting,Property rights,Socioeconomics,Property rights,Nonpossessory interest in land,Property rights,Opportunity cost,Microeconomics,Serfdom,Microeconomics,Land reform,Social insurance,Psychological resilience,Nonmarket forces","Paul Castañeda Dower,Andrei Markevich,Klaus Deininger,Gershon Feder,Steven Nafziger,Timothy J.

([Gerbens-Leenes, P.W., Nonhebel, S., Iven, W.P.M.F., 2002. A method to determine land requirements relating to food consumption patterns. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 90: 47-45]) in examining food consumption patterns and arable land requirements of Guyuan District, a remote rural area of western China. Population growth and rapid economic development have increasingly been reducing the land available for primary production, creating potentially serious risks for China's food security. Land required to produce food is determined by population size, consumption patterns, land resource endowment - or ""agro-ecological"" conditions and the level of farm intensification. Per capita land requirements in Guyuan District were identified to meet basic consumption needs, and to evaluate nutritional conditions related to current consumption patterns. Data used for this analysis were obtained from surveys of household food consumption. Food consumption involved only meeting basic requirements for sustenance, with grains, potatoes, vegetables, fruits, and plant oils being the most commonly consumed foods. Per capita intake of calories totaled 11.1Â MJÂ·day-Â 1, matching the recommended level for China to meet basic health requirements. Daily protein intake was 66.8Â gÂ·person-Â 1Â·day-Â 1, being below the recommended standard of 77Â gÂ·person-Â 1Â·day-Â 1. Of this total, protein from animal meat accounted for only 7.5% of total protein. Fat intake totaled only 47.4Â gÂ·person-Â 1Â·day-Â 1, being far below the standard of 70Â gÂ·person-Â 1Â·day-Â 1. Yet, farmers must sell their limited livestock to earn enough income to meet their daily consumption needs. This expenditure accounted for nearly 33% of mean annual household income, so only 28% of domestic animal products were consumed locally.

Specifically, the authors provide evidence on whether financial ratios and non-financial factors can be jointly included as indicators to improve the predictive capacity of organisational success or failure in different countries and sectors.,The paper utilises a mixed method exploratory case study focussing on listed corporations in the US and Australian manufacturing, agriculture, finance and property sectors.,The financial ratio findings demonstrate that (with the exception of the failed Australian manufacturing sector) the integrated multi-measure (IMM) ratio approach consistently provides a higher classification rate for the failed and successful groups than those provided by an individual measure. In all cases the IMM method scored higher for US companies (with the exception of the failed Australian property sector). The findings also show that irrespective of the country location or sector, non-financial factors such as board composition and managements’ involvement in organisational strategy impact on a corporation’s success or failure.,The findings reveal that non-financial factors occur prior to financial ratios when attempting to predict organisational success or failure and the IMM approach enables a more thorough examination of the predictive ability of financial ratios for US and Australian organisations. This intuitively indicates that when combined with financial ratios, non-financial factors may be a useful predictor of corporate success or failure across countries and sectors.,Sound internal processes and the identification of both financial ratios and non-financial factors can be utilised to improve the reliability of financial failure models, enable corrective and preventative steps to be implemented by management and potentially reduce the costs of failure for US and Australian organisations.","Organisational strategy,Marketing,Manufacturing sector,Financial ratio,Economics,Corporation,Classification rate,Agriculture,Accounting,Sociology,Single-subject design,Organizational Case Studies,Social venture,Social science,Perception,Soft computing,Rough set,Mathematics,Teamwork,Red flags,Public relations,Work experience,Upper echelons,Strategic planning,Secondary research,Research design,Qualitative research,Tax benefits of debt,Probability of default,Linear discriminant analysis,Probabilistic logic,Maximum likelihood,Financial ratio,Spell,Recession,Public relations,Strategy development,Software deployment,Public relations","Nigel Purves,Scott J.

361,Impact of land ownership on productivity and efficiency of rice farmers: The case of the Philippines,2015-01-01,Land Use Policy,10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2015.10.001,"Land is a key factor in production agriculture and the land rental market is an important institution in agriculture. Rental activity of both sharecropped and fixed rent arrangements represents about 25% of cultivated land in the Philippines. The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) of 1988, which essentially redistributes land to landless farmers, has implications for land ownership and farm productivity. This study investigates the impact of land ownership on the productivity and technical efficiency of rice farmers in the Philippines. We use a 2007–2012 Loop Survey from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and a stochastic frontier function method. Results show that land ownership has a significant impact on technical efficiency. In particular, counter to the theory, the CARP may have reduced the technical efficiency of leasehold farmers compared with owner operators. Additionally, results show that land area, fuel cost, fertilizer cost, irrigation cost, and labor cost are significant factors that affect rice production. We found a mean technical efficiency score of 0.79—still leaving room for improvement. Finally, educated females and farmers leasing land have higher technical inefficiency.","Renting,Leasehold estate,Land tenure,Irrigation,Inefficiency,Economics,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Agrarian system,Agrarian reform,Stochastic frontier analysis,Statistics,Profit efficiency,Stochastic frontier analysis,Panel data,Function model,sort,Stochastic frontier analysis,Random variable,Stochastic frontier analysis,Simar,Production–possibility frontier,Two step,Stochastic modelling,Single step,Returns to scale,Production–possibility frontier,Microeconomics,Truncated regression model,Regression,Production–possibility frontier,Survey data collection,Stochastic frontier analysis,Statistics,Staple food,Public economics,Market price,X-inefficiency,Profit efficiency,Productive efficiency","Krishna H.

Around 40.142 Mt y −1 of the total crop residue is generated from various major and minor crops, of which around 71% is consumed in various forms, resulting in 29% as a net surplus available for power generation. Basic surplus and net surplus crop residues for power generation potential were estimated in each district. Sangrur, Ferozpur, Amritsar, Patiala and Ludhiana are the major surplus biomass potential districts, while Rupnagar, Nawashahar, Hoshiarpur, Fatehgarh Sahib, Faridkot and Kapurthalla are least surplus biomass potential districts within the state. It has been estimated that around 1.510 GW and 1.464 GW of power in the state can be generated through basic surplus and net surplus biomass respectively.

Firstly, the plant is a staple in both Northern and Southern Brazil, which allows for comparisons along various ecological and sociocultural dimensions. Secondly, despite its vegetative multiplication, there is an immense diversity of manioc varieties, both at the regional and local levels, which makes possible analysis of the relations between diversity and its cultural basis. The issue we address here is a comparative study of manioc management in two traditional contexts of slash-and-burn agriculture, one in the Atlantic forest region and the other in the Amazon.

Greenhouse vegetable production is the major agricultural activity in this area (Menderes Township). However, due to the pollution risk from agriculture, governmental authorities have issued a regulation discouraging the use of chemicals within the collection basin of the dam. An on-farm project was conducted in 2001 to introduce organic greenhouse vegetable production in the Tahtali Dam preservation area and to serve as a model for other areas in Turkey facing similar ecological problems. Two irrigation levels and four organic fertilizers were tested on the growth of cucumbers (Cucumis sativus cv. Sardes). The four fertilizers were two rates of farmyard and poultry manure (30 and 50 tons ha -1 ) with and without two organic fertilizers based on either bacteria or algae. During the growing period, pests and diseases were monitored weekly and preparations allowed in organic agriculture were used when necessary. Plant diseases did not create any significant problem, but the pest population, in particular spidermites, increased. No significant differences in cucumber yield were found between the fertilizer and irrigation treatments tested. However, it should be noted that yields from the addition of 30 tons ha -1 of farmyard or poultry manure and organic fertilizers were the same as those for 50 tons ha -1 of manure alone. The average total yield was 13 kg m -2 , within an acceptable range for short-term crop production in this region, but 55% lower than a conventional substrate culture trial nearby. However, due to reduced production costs and a price premium for organic products, the organic produce yielded a net return of US$1.12-1.79 per m 2 whereas that for conventional bag culture produce was US$0.55 per m 2 . Our results indicate that, under present conditions, organic greenhouse cucumber production has less environmental impact and is more economic than conventional bag culture, due to reduced chemical input and reduced operating and initial investment costs.","Population,Organic product,Organic fertilizer,Organic farming,Manure,Irrigation,Fertilizer,Economics,Agronomy,Agriculture,Nematology,Laboratory methods,Biology,Organic farming,Integrated production,Good agricultural practice,Titratable acid,Sowing,Soluble solids,Pesticide,Horticulture,Greenhouse,White cabbage,Plant composition,Organic farming,Rural development,Library science,Environmental science,Environmental chemistry,Biology","Y.

However, research on the impact of policy implementation on people's livelihood and activities and the subsequent economic development of an area is incomplete. We selected Yanchang County as an example to track land use changes and their effects on the livelihood of the local population following the implementation of a new land use policy known as the Grain for Green Project (GGP). The data were collected from statistical yearbooks, questionnaire surveys, and satellite imagery from 1990, 2000, and 2008. We found that dramatic land use changes have occurred in Yanchang County. The vegetation coverage improved significantly from 1990 to 2008, as the grassland and forest areas increased from 44.1% to 60.1% and from 17.7% to 18.4% of the total land area, respectively. The cultivated land declined from 37.3% to 20.7%. With the agricultural area and grain production decreasing from 64 × 103 tons to slightly over 20 × 103 tons per year, an increasing number of local people sought employment in towns and cities. The non-farm income increased, and the local income structure shifted. Migrant and orchard worker income contributed the most to the balance of the total household income. We narrowed our focus to discuss how the GGP accelerated the changes in the participants� lifestyles and what might be done to sustain the long-term effects of the GGP. While the GGP has brought about considerable environmental benefits, a comprehensive study of environmental�social systems is still needed to achieve a more efficient land use policy. The research results presented in this paper demonstrate that changes in land use and people's activities were triggered by policy changes. We aim to pave the way for studies on the �policy-land-use-social development� chain and to provide references for new policies.","Vegetation,Satellite imagery,Livelihood,Land use,Household income,Grassland,Environmental protection,Economics,China,Agriculture,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Sustainability,Poverty,Population growth,Vulnerability,Sustainable development,Political economy of climate change,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource,Sustainability,Subsidy,Payment,Vulnerability,Policy development,Numerical models,Terrestrial ecosystem,Marine ecosystem,Eutrophication,Woodland,Sustainability,Soil conservation,Urbanization,Population,Natural resource","Nahui Zhen,Bojie Fu,Yihe Lü,Zhenmin Zheng,Millenium Ecosystem Assessment,Jonathan A.

Evidence suggests that both the agrarian and exogenous models are anachronistic. However, the Common Agricultural Policy remains closest to the agrarian model of rural development, and in its current form fails to promote a wider rural and territorial development. The LEADER programme, which is often perceived as a viable alternative approach to rural development, fits most closely with the neo-endogenous rather than with the endogenous model. Nevertheless, for EU policy to fully embody the neo-endogenous model a far more fundamental reform of the CAP would be required than that agreed in the wake of the Health Check.","Territorial development,Rural economics,Rural development,LEADER programme,Economics,Economic growth,Development economics,Common Agricultural Policy,Agriculture,Agricultural policy,Agrarian society,Sociology,Social science,Rural society,Socioeconomics,Rural economics,Regional economics,Spatial planning,Sociology,Social science,Rural development,Pillar,European policy,Sociology,Social science,Social exclusion,Single Farm Payment,Mindset,Liberalization,Subsidy,Protectionism,Policy mix,Tertiary sector of the economy,Rural sociology,Rural management,Rural policy,Rural area,Productivism,Rural area,Role perception,Qualitative research","Carmen Hubbard,Matthew Gorton,Geoff A.

Since nature integrates her plants and animals into diverse landscape, a major tenet of sustainable agriculture is efficiency and lack of waste products in nature. When domestication of crops replaced hunting and gathering of food, landscape changed accordingly. By producing a limited selection of crop plants and animals, human kind has substantially reduced the level of biological diversity over much of the earth. There is more cooperation in nature than competition. Cooperation is exemplified by mutually beneficial relationships that occur between species within communities. If left undistributed and unplanted an abandoned crop field will first be colonized by just a few species of organisms but after several years a complex community made up of many wild species develops. Stability is reached by a community when it has reached a high level of diversity. Diverse communities have fewer fluctuations in numbers of a given species and are stable. The practices which promote diversity and stability on the farm are enterprise diversification, crop rotation, use of wind breaks, provision of more habitats for microorganisms, intercropping and integration of crop farming with livestock production. Intercropping is the cultivation of two or more crops at the same time in the same field. Its advantages are risk minimization, increased income and food security, reduction of soil erosion and pest and disease control. This paper discusses the practice of intercropping in horticultural crop production to promote sustainability. Many crop systems are discussed.","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Intercropping,Food security,Crop rotation,Crop protection,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Weed control,Weed,Population,Trap crop,Subsistence agriculture,Striga,Technology transfer,Sustainable agriculture,Soil management,Research needs,Intercropping,Economics,Soil water,Soil classification,Poaceae,Weed,Tephrosia vogelii,Tephrosia,Understory,Legume,Intercropping,Radopholus similis,Pratylenchus goodeyi,Pratylenchidae,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Tiller,Stemborer,Sowing,Poaceae","George Ouma,P.

Madagascar is no exception and land-use change, mostly driven by slash-and-burn agriculture, is impacting the island's exceptional biodiversity. Although most species are negatively affected by agricultural expansion, some, such as synanthropic bats, are capable of exploring newly available resources and benefit from man-made agricultural ecosystems. As bats are known predators of agricultural pests it seems possible that Malagasy bats may be preferentially foraging within agricultural areas and therefore provide important pest suppression services. To investigate the potential role of bats as pest suppressors, we conducted acoustic surveys of insectivorous bats in and around Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, during November and December 2015. We surveyed five landcover types: irrigated rice, hillside rice, secondary vegetation, forest fragment and continuous forest. 9569 bat passes from a regional assemblage of 19 species were recorded. In parallel, we collected faeces from the six most common bat species to detect insect pest species in their diet using DNA metabarcoding. Total bat activity was higher over rice fields when compared to forest and bats belonging to the open space and edge space sonotypes were the most benefited by the conversion of forest to hillside and irrigated rice. Two economically important rice pests were detected in the faecal samples collected - the paddy swarming armyworm Spodoptera mauritia was detected in Mops leucogaster samples while the grass webworm Herpetogramma licarsisalis was detected from Mormopterus jugularis and Miniopterus majori samples. Other crops pests detected included the sugarcane cicada Yanga guttulata, the macadamia nut-borer Thaumatotibia batrachopa and the sober tabby Ericeia inangulata (a pest of citrus fruits). Samples from all bat species also contained reads from important insect disease vectors. In light of our results we argue that Malagasy insectivorous bats have the potential to suppress agricultural pests. It is important to retain and maximise Malagasy bat populations as they may contribute to higher agricultural yields and promote sustainable livelihoods.","Pipistrellus,Pest control,Mormopterus jugularis,Insectivore,Habitat,Deforestation,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Software engineering,Software analytics,Reference software,mothur,UniFrac,Tenericutes,Source code,Sorting,Shuffling,Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee,Engineering ethics,Ecology,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide,Sequence analysis,Sequence alignment,Sequence Read Archive,Terrestrial ecosystem,Sustainable yield,Soil biodiversity,Wildlife,Taxon,Metagenomics,White-nose syndrome,Predation,Insectivore,Taxonomic rank,Species diversity,Ribosomal RNA","James Kemp,Adrià López-Baucells,Ricardo Rocha,Owen S.

To cater for their food requirements, smallholders use only modest levels of inorganic fertilizers and rely to a large extent on manure, which is generally of low quality. To explore factors influencing fertilizer and manure use at the farm level, 253 farm households in Vihiga district of western Kenya were sampled. A pair of Tobit models was used to relate amounts of manure and fertilizer used to household variables. The results indicate that the use of both manure and fertilizer reciprocally influence each other and are strongly influenced by household factors, and also imply that manure and fertilizer uses are endogenous. Policy changes are required to (1) reduce the burden on farming alone in rural areas; (2) promote the use of higher-cost, higher-value inputs such as fertilizers; (3) improve access to input and output markets; and (4) encourage farmer education so as to promote sustainable soil fertility management. Improved understanding of the biophysical and socioeconomic environment of smallholder systems can help target sustainable soil fertility interventions more appropriately.","Soil management,Soil fertility,Population,Manure,Food security,Fertilizer,Chemistry,Arable land,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Sustainability,Small farm,Rural area,Soil fertility,Natural resource economics,Natural resource,Poverty,Population density,Livestock,Tobit model,Stratified sampling,Sierra leone,West africa,Tobit model,Subjective perception,Soil organic matter,Soil fertility,Soil biodiversity,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Willingness to pay,Profitability index,Profit margin,Sustainable development,Social capital,Poverty,Poverty,Population,Geography","Michael M.

386,International agricultural research to reduce food risks: case studies on aflatoxins,2015-01-01,Food Security,10.1007/S12571-015-0469-2,"Despite massive expansion of human and livestock populations, fuelled by agricultural innovations, nearly one billion people are hungry and 2 billion are sickened each year from the food they eat. Agricultural and food systems are intimately connected to health outcomes, but health policy and programs often stop at the clinic door. A consensus is growing that the disconnection between agriculture, health and nutrition is at least partly responsible for the disease burden associated with food and farming. Mycotoxins produced by fungi are one of the most serious food safety problems affecting staple crops (especially maize and groundnuts). Aflatoxins, the best studied of these mycotoxins, cause around 90,000 cases of liver cancer each year and are strongly associated with stunting and immune suppression in children. Mycotoxins also cause major economic disruptions through their impacts on trade and livestock production. In this paper we use the case of fungal toxins to explore how agricultural research can produce innovations, understand incentives and enable institutions to improve, simultaneously, food safety, food accessibility for poor consumers and access to markets for smallholder farmers, thus making the case for research investors to support research into agricultural approaches for enhancing food safety in value chains. We first discuss the evolution of food safety research within the CGIAR. Then we show how taking an epidemiological and economic perspective on aflatoxin research connects health and nutrition outcomes. Finally, we present three case studies illustrating the traditional strengths of CGIAR research: breeding better varieties and developing new technologies.","Livestock,Health policy,Good agricultural practice,Food systems,Food security,Food safety,Environmental resource management,Economics,Economic growth,Disease burden,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Medicine,Intensive care medicine,Cohort study,Pathology,Medicine,Liver cancer,Survey data collection,Phytosanitary certification,International standard,Toxicology,Outbreak,Mycotoxin,Veterinary medicine,Poverty,Livestock,Underweight,Toxicology,Public health,Pesticide use,Pesticide,Natural resource economics,Thin-layer chromatography,Specific detection,Sample preparation,West africa,Rural area,Public health,Weaning,Vitamin,Socioeconomic status","Delia Grace,George Mahuku,Vivian Hoffmann,Christine Atherstone,Hari D.

387,Honey Bee Queen Production: Canadian Costing Case Study and Profitability Analysis.,2020-01-01,Journal of Economic Entomology,10.1093/JEE/TOAA102,"The decline in managed honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colony health worldwide has had a significant impact on the beekeeping industry. To mitigate colony losses, beekeepers in Canada and around the world introduce queens into replacement colonies; however, Canada's short queen rearing season has historically limited the production of early season queens. As a result, Canadian beekeepers rely on the importation of foreign bees, particularly queens from warmer climates. Importing a large proportion of (often mal-adapted) queens each year creates a dependency on foreign bee sources, putting beekeeping, and pollination sectors at risk in the event of border closures, transportation issues, and other restrictions as is currently happening due to the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. Although traditional Canadian queen production is unable to fully meet early season demand, increasing domestic queen production to meet mid- and later season demand would reduce Canada's dependency. As well, on-going studies exploring the potential for overwintering queens in Canada may offer a strategy to have early season domestic queens available. Increasing the local supply of queens could provide Canadian beekeepers, farmers, and consumers with a greater level of agricultural stability and food security. Our study is the first rigorous analysis of the economic feasibility of queen production. We present the costs of queen production for three Canadian operations over two years. Our results show that it can be profitable for a beekeeping operation in Canada to produce queen cells and mated queens and could be one viable strategy to increase the sustainability of the beekeeping industry.","Sustainability,Pollination,Overwintering,Honey bee,Food security,Biology,Beekeeping,Apidae,Agronomy,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination,Worker bee,Western honey bee,Varroa destructor,Population,Overwintering,Mortality rate,Veterinary medicine,Varroa sensitive hygiene,Varroa destructor,Varroa,Risk factor,Relative risk,Zoology,Spermatheca,Sperm,Worker policing,Worker bee,Swarming (honey bee),Worker bee,Reproductive potential,Pollinator,Trait,Selective breeding,Polygene,Polygyny,Natural selection,Larva","Miriam Bixby,Shelley E Hoover,Robyn McCallum,Abdullah Ibrahim,Lynae Ovinge,Sawyer Olmstead,Stephen F Pernal,Amro Zayed,Leonard J Foster,M Marta Guarna,Simon Geoffrey Potts,Jacobus C.

In this paper we present the results of a dermal exposure assessment for the potato farming system in the highlands of Colombia, where farmers apply pesticides with hand pressure sprayers without any personal protective equipment. The fractioning of the pesticide, in terms of potential and actual dermal exposure, was determined via the whole-body dosimetry methodology, using the tracer uranine as pesticide surrogate, and luminescence spectrometry as analytical method. We assessed the three activities involved in pesticide management: preparation, application, and cleaning; analyzed three types of nozzles: one with a standard discharge and two modified by farmers to increase the discharge; and derived the protection factor given by work clothing. Our results suggest that to reduce the health risk, three aspects have to be considered: (i) avoiding the modification of nozzles, which affects the droplet size spectrum and increases the level of dermal exposure; (ii) using adequate work clothing made of thick fabrics, especially on the upper body parts; and (iii) cleaning properly the tank sprayer before the application activity.","Upper body,Sprayer,Pesticide use,Pesticide,Personal protective equipment,Occupational hygiene,Environmental engineering,Engineering,Dermal exposure,Agriculture,Spray nozzle,Spray characteristics,Positioning system,Textile,Synthetic fiber,Surface tension,Sprayer,Spray nozzle,Spray characteristics,Wind tunnel,Simulation,Marine engineering,Soil Pollutants,Pesticide,Persistence (computer science),Public health,Pesticide,Medicine,Wind tunnel,Wind speed,Sampling (statistics),Sprayer,Re entry,Procymidone,Sprayer,Pesticide residue,Pesticide drift,Whole body,Waste management,Ventilation (architecture)","Camilo Lesmes-Fabian,Glenda García-Santos,Fanny Leuenberger,David Nuyttens,D Nuyttens,Katrijn Baetens,M De Schampheleire,B Sonck,Seungsin Lee,S.

The use of land in this operation helps to conserve the environment and promotes the sustainable use of natural resources. The demand for organic products has increased, especially in Europe, North America and Oceania, and hence has created export potential for developing countries. Turkey is a typical case among developing countries of the establishment of organic agriculture based on export potential. About 85% of its current organic production is exported to EU countries, and this is predicted to expand further.

392,The effects of carbon reduction on sectoral competitiveness in China: A case of Shanghai,2017-01-01,Applied Energy,10.1016/J.APENERGY.2017.04.026,"The Chinese government has committed to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions per unit gross domestic product by 60–65% from 2005 levels by 2030. In order to achieve this commitment, various measures should be taken. Due to the complex relationship between carbon emission and economic development, it is critical to quantify the impacts of different measures. Under such a circumstance, this paper is to identify the effects of carbon tax on the sectoral competitiveness in Shanghai by 2030 under unequal imposition of carbon tax between Shanghai and the rest of China by using a two-region dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Research results show that different carbon tax rates in different regions would affect GDP of Shanghai and the outcomes are different under different scenarios. In general, a lower carbon tax rate can lead to a higher output and these output changes could further influence the sectoral competitiveness. Under the tax44 scenario, sectors such as agriculture, textile, transport equipment, and electronics are the winners in Shanghai, with outputs increased by 2.02%, 1.47%, 1.08% and 3.05%, respectively; while food production, petrol oil, chemicals and non-metal are the losers, with outputs decreased by 2.02%, 0.87%, 0.03% and 2.39%, respectively. This study also reveals that price and scale effects are the key factors influencing the changes of sectoral outputs. Such findings provide useful insights to those policy makers to allocate appropriate carbon reduction targets to different regions.","Waste management,Natural resource economics,International trade,Gross domestic product,Food processing,Economics,Computable general equilibrium,China,Carbon tax,Carbon dioxide,Carbon,Agriculture,Trend analysis,Physical geography,Match/mismatch,Environmental science,Climatology,Climate change,Waste management,Industrial waste,Fossil fuel,Programming language,Nonlinear system,Mathematical optimization,Supply chain,Scarcity,Purchasing,Waste management,Renewable energy,Primary energy,Natural resource economics,Fossil fuel,Environmental resource management,Waste management,Volatility (finance),Solar power,Simulation,Price elasticity of demand,Logistic function,Value-added tax,Tax reform,Tax credit","Xu Tian,Hancheng Dai,Yong Geng,Zhen Huang,Camille Parmesan,Gary Yohe,Rajendra K.

With a case study for Flevoland, the Netherlands, we illustrate that (1) crop models cannot account for all relevant climate change impacts and adaptation options, and (2) changes in technology, policy and prices have had and are likely to have larger impacts on farms than climate change. While crop modelling indicates positive impacts of climate change on yields of major crops in 2050, a semi-quantitative and participatory method assessing impacts of extreme events shows that there are nevertheless several climate risks. A range of adaptation measures are, however, available to reduce possible negative effects at crop level. In addition, at farm level farmers can change cropping patterns, and adjust inputs and outputs. Also farm structural change will influence impacts and adaptation. While the 5th IPCC report is more negative regarding impacts of climate change on agriculture compared to the previous report, also for temperate regions, our results show that when putting climate change in context of other drivers, and when explicitly accounting for adaptation at crop and farm level, impacts may be less negative in some regions and opportunities are revealed. These results refer to a temperate region, but an integrated assessment may also change perspectives on climate change for other parts of the world.","Temperate climate,Systems analysis,Impact assessment,European union,Environmental resource management,Economics,Cropping,Crop yield,Climate change,Agriculture,Solver,Software,Returns to scale,Tropics,Representative Concentration Pathways,Food security,Temperate climate,Plant production,Food security,Yield gap,Population,Land use,Hindcast,Food security,Environmental resource management,Geography,Agroforestry,Agricultural science,Yield gap,Soil quality,Precision agriculture,Simulation modeling,Radiative forcing,Natural resource economics,Temperate climate,Stem elongation,Nitrogen fertilization,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Process management","Pytrik Reidsma,Joost Wolf,Argyris Kanellopoulos,Ben F Schaap,Maryia Mandryk,Jan Verhagen,Martin K van Ittersum,William W.

The impact of agricultural intensification varies according to national and local contexts and a greater understanding of the drivers of intensification will help to mitigate against its negative impacts and harness potential benefits. This paper analyses changes in land use intensity in six case studies in Europe. A total of 437 landowners were interviewed and their responses were analysed in relation to changes in land use intensity and agricultural production between 2001 and 2011. In the case studies in Western and Eastern Europe we observed stabilisation during the last decade, and no clear tendency of increase or decrease of land use intensity. The use of fertilizers and pesticides seems to have decreased in our cases in Western Europe, which is contrary to trends in Eastern Europe. Agricultural production remained stable in almost all cases, except for an increase in Austria and Romania which may indicate that the farming efficiency has increased. A statistical analysis showed a division between study areas in Romania and Austria (increasing land use intensity) versus those in the Netherlands, Denmark and Greece (decreasing). In the Mediterranean cases we observe a process where agriculture is becoming increasingly marginalised, at the same time as changes in function with regard to urbanisation and recreational land uses have taken place. Logistic regression highlighted the importance of farm size and farmer type in understanding changes in land use intensity. The dominant pattern of stabilisation which has occurred over the past 10 years may also partly be a result of effective EU and national environmental and agricultural policies, which are increasingly concerned with improving environmental conditions in rural areas.","Western europe,Urbanization,Rural area,Recreation,Mediterranean climate,Land use,Environmental protection,Economics,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Sustainability,Poverty,Population growth,Western culture,Urbanization,Urban climate,Natural resource economics,Land use,European union,Vegetation,Stratified sampling,Stratification (seeds),Geography,Environmental protection,Environmental planning,Urbanization,Subsistence agriculture,Spatial variability,Sociology,Social science,Rural society,Vision,Systems science,Stakeholder engagement,Sustainability,Measurement of biodiversity,Food security","Theo van der Sluis,Bas Pedroli,Søren Bech Pilgaard Kristensen,Georgia Cosor,Evangelos S.

However, research on vulnerability, its determinants, and policy implications is still rather limited in developing countries. Based on statistics on peasant households threatened by geological disasters at the Three Gorges Reservoir area, this paper studied external risk impacts on peasant households’ poverty vulnerability with relation to migrant work income. The results show that: 1) Agricultural income loss does not significantly impact peasant household poverty vulnerability. However, geological disaster impacts and housing construction or purchase exert significantly positive influences, acting as the dominant influences on peasant household poverty vulnerability. 2) Savings and migrant work income can significantly reduce the impact of external risks on peasant household poverty vulnerability. To be specific, future consumption for peasants with savings is 47.1% (model 3) and 32.5% (model 5) lower than that for peasants without savings, and with every 1% increase in the proportion of migrant work income, future consumption variance for peasant households falls 25.2% (model 3) and 24.9% (model 5) on average.

397,From colonization to “environmental soy”: A case study of environmental and socio-economic valuation in the Amazon soy frontier,2007-01-01,Agriculture and Human Values,10.1007/S10460-006-9030-4,"This paper examines the socio-economic and environmental implications of soy development in Santarem, Para, located in the Brazilian Amazon. The settlement history of the region contributes directly to the way in which soy agriculture is currently proceeding in Santarem. Government policies and perspectives have been shaped by a history of agrarian colonization of Amazon forests, and the small farmers, or colonos, who are now being bought out by soy agribusiness are also rooted in this history. As a means of ascertaining the current state and interaction of soy actors with the burgeoning soy-based economy in the area, field research was conducted on the role of primary and secondary forests for soy production. Research also included an analysis of valuation discourses – that is, how the differing soy actors (local government, agribusiness, conservation NGOs, and small farmers) assign value to types of forests and their different interpretations of what constitutes environmental degradation. The ways in which these different actors assign such values to forests and how they structure the definition of environmental degradation is a key factor in determining who “wins” and “loses” in the realm of Amazon development. Significant environmental and socio-economic implications of soy expansion, especially for the colonos, are not taken into account because the dominant rhetoric of Amazonian development ignores their contribution to social and ecological diversity. This omission keeps colono communities living at poverty level and even exacerbates colono poverty under the soy development project. The colonos and their representatives are responding by setting forth their own, competing valuations of primary and secondary forests that contrast sharply with state soy growing schemes and NGO plans for “sustainable soy.” These have their roots in local knowledge and best practices.

398,A National Residue Control Plan from the analytical perspective--the Brazilian case.,2009-01-01,Analytica Chimica Acta,10.1016/J.ACA.2008.09.061,"Food safety is a strategic topic entailing not only national public health aspects but also competitiveness in international trade. An important component of any food safety program is the control and monitoring of residues posed by certain substances involved in food production. In turn, a National Residue Control Plan (NRCP) relies on an appropriate laboratory network, not only to generate analytical results, but also more broadly to verify and co-validate the controls built along the food production chain. Therefore laboratories operating under a NRCP should work in close cooperation with inspection bodies, fostering the critical alignment of the whole system with the principles of risk analysis. Beyond producing technically valid results, these laboratories should arguably be able to assist in the prediction and establishment of targets for official control. In pursuit of analytical excellence, the Brazilian government has developed a strategic plan for Official Agricultural Laboratories. Inserted in a national agenda for agricultural risk analysis, the plan has succeeded in raising laboratory budget by approximately 200%, it has started a rigorous program for personnel capacity-building, it has initiated strategic cooperation with international reference centres, and finally, it has completely renewed instrumental resources and rapidly triggered a program aimed at full laboratory compliance with ISO/IEC 17025 requirements.","Strategic planning,Risk analysis (business),Public health,Government,Food safety,Food processing,Excellence,Environmental economics,Chromatography,Chemistry,Agriculture,Biology","Angelo de Q.

This is achieved by classifying farms into groups that have common characteristics, i.e. farm types, which can support the implementation of a more tailored approach to agricultural development. This article explored patterns of farming system diversity through the classification of 70 smallholder farm households in two districts (Savelugu-Nanton and Tolon-Kumbungu) of Ghana⿿s Northern Region. Based on 2013 survey data, the typology was constructed using the multivariate statistical techniques of principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Results proposed six farm types, stratified on the basis of household, labour, land use, livestock and income variables, explaining the structural and functional differences between farming systems. Types 1 and 2 were characterized by relatively high levels of resource endowment and oriented towards non-farm activities and crop sales respectively. Types 3 and 4 were moderately resource-endowed with income derived primarily from on-farm activities. Types 5 and 6 were resource constrained, with production oriented towards subsistence. The most salient differences among farm types concerned herd size (largest for Type 1), degree of legume integration (largest for Types 2⿿4), household size and hired labour (smallest household size for Types 4 and 6, and largest proportion of hired labour for Type 4), degree of diversification into off/non-farm activities (highest for Type 1 and lowest for Type 5) and severity of resource constraints (Type 6 was most constrained with a small farm area and herd comprised mainly of poultry). It was found that livelihood strategies reflected the distinctive characteristics of farm households; with poorly-endowed types restricted to a ⿿survival strategy⿿ and more affluent types free to pursue a ⿿development strategy⿿. This study clearly demonstrates that using the established typology as a practical framework allows identification of type-specific farm household opportunities and constraints for the targeting of agricultural interventions and innovations, which will be further analysed in the research-for-development project. We conclude that a more flexible approach to typology construction, for example through the incorporation of farmer perspectives, might provide further context and insight into the causes, consequences and negotiation of farm diversity.","Typology,Survey data collection,Subsistence agriculture,Small farm,Livelihood,Land use,Environmental resource management,Economics,Diversification (marketing strategy),Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Silhouette coefficient,Silhouette,Mathematics,Structural equation modeling,Statistics,Regression analysis,Standard of living,Poverty,Portfolio,Rural poverty,Rural economics,Rural area,Engineering drawing,Computer science,Vulnerability,Self-insurance,Rural poverty,Poverty,Per capita,Land use,Poverty,Market access,Livestock,Sorting,Principal component analysis,Notation,Single-linkage clustering,Mathematics,Machine learning","K.S.

The sludge was amended with a soil mixture (i.e., a mixture of sand, soil, and manure) and was applied at 0, 165, 330, 495 and 660 t/ha to promote the growth of cucumbers. The effects of various sludge loadings on plant growth were assessed by counting plants and leaves, measuring stem lengths, and weighing the green parts and roots of the plants. We also compared heavy metal uptake by the plants for sludge loadings of 330, 495, and 660 t/ha with various recommended standards for vegetables. Our results showed that plant growth patterns were influenced to some extent by the sludge loadings. In general, the number of leaves, stem length, and dry weight of green parts exhibited a pronounced positive growth response compared with an unfertilized control, and root growth showed a lesser but still significant response at sludge loadings of 165 and 330 t/ha. The sludge application caused no significant increase in heavy metal concentrations in the leaves, though zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) were found at elevated concentrations. However, despite the Zn and Fe accumulation, we observed no toxicity symptoms in the plants. This may be a result of cucumber's tolerance of high metal levels.","Zinc,Waste management,Vegetable processing,Sludge,Significant response,Sewage,Manure,Dry weight,Chemistry,Agronomy,Agriculture,Water supply,Water industry,Total suspended solids,Waste management,Soil water,Soil structure,Topsoil,Soil quality,Soil management,Topsoil,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Waste treatment,Waste management,Valorisation,Water pollution,Soil pH,Soil contamination,Soil water,Sludge,Phytotoxicity,Straw,Soil contamination,Sludge,Ultisol,Soil water,Soil pH,Waste management,Soil test,Soil pH","Deniz Dolgen,M.

In this study we look at the case of Ghana to identify whether fast population growth and the remarkable agricultural performance the country has enjoyed in recent years have resulted in favorable conditions for the adoption of Asian-style Green Revolution technologies. Through descriptive analysis combined with empirical assessment of the economic efficiency of agriculture in different production systems and agroecologies we are able assess the relevance of Green Revolution technologies for agricultural production in Ghana. In particular, we analyze whether fertilizer use in Ghana is associated with high population density and intensive cereal production and whether land-intensive innovations are associated with more efficient production practices. Overall, we do not find evidence of Asian-style Green Revolution agricultural intensification in Ghana; in fact, we find no correlation between population density and input intensity. We also find that labor costs still play a major role in Ghanaian agricultural development in limiting the adoption of labor-intensive technologies even in relatively high population density areas.","Technological change,Population growth,Green Revolution,Economics,Economic efficiency,Descriptive statistics,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural policy,Agricultural economics,Truncated regression model,Simar,Returns to scale,Sketch,Operations research,Operations management,Livelihood,Green Revolution,Food security,Wage inequality,Technological change,Technical progress,Technical change,Microeconomics,Market size,Social impact,Natural resource economics,Green Revolution,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Green Revolution,Business,Agricultural economics,Agricultural development,Rural area,Nonfarm payrolls,Job creation,Welfare,Urbanization,Positive relationship","Alejandro Nin-Pratt,Linden McBride,R.

402,Factors influencing perception of protected areas—The case of Natura 2000 in Polish Carpathian communities,2012-01-01,Journal for Nature Conservation,10.1016/J.JNC.2012.05.005,"Establishing protected areas has emerged as one of the key aims in global and EU conservation policy. In the EU, the particular role of providing biodiversity conservation was bestowed on the European Ecological Network Natura 2000. However, public perception of this initiative has been negative in most countries. In this manuscript, we present a representative description of knowledge and attitudes of inhabitants of Polish Carpathians’ municipalities included into Natura 2000. The research was conducted in six municipalities among 906 respondents. Majority (92%) of respondents believe that it is a good measure to legally protect nature in their area. Additionally, we analysed how selected features of respondents influence their perception of protected areas. Level of education, the fact that respondents moved to their current place of residence in adulthood and that they are self-employed, are the characteristics that most significantly influence their knowledge of Natura 2000. Moreover, ownership of a business, familiarity with Natura 2000 and the respondents’ age affect their level of satisfaction with a Natura 2000 site designated in their region. We focus on differences in awareness and acceptance of the programme among different municipalities’ inhabitants – in the municipality fully covered by a Natura 2000 site, inhabitants are most knowledgeable about nature conservation issues but at the same time they opposed it most strongly. In a typical agricultural municipality, knowledge on nature conservation issues is low while in the touristic-type, the vast majority of residents have no opinion on designation of new protected areas at all. Based on the results of the following study we suggest that development of tools on how to manage the protected areas effectively should rely both on traditional ecological analysis and that of a social type.","Residence,Perception,Nature Conservation,Natura 2000,Environmental resource management,Ecological network,Ecological analysis,Biology,Biodiversity conservation,Agriculture,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Tragedy of the commons,Tragedy of the anticommons,Natural resource,World Database on Protected Areas,Protected area,Private protected area,Tropics,Tropical biodiversity,Private protected area,Environmental ethics,Convention on Biological Diversity,Biology,Tropical deforestation,Protected area,Matching methods,Welfare,Socioeconomic development,Protected area,Temperate grassland,Reference Document,IUCN Red List,Protected area,IUCN Red List,Geography,Transparency (graphic),Psychological resilience,Protected area","Agata Pietrzyk-Kaszyńska,Joanna Cent,Małgorzata Grodzińska-Jurczak,Magdalena Szymańska,Millenium Ecosystem Assessment,Elinor Ostrom,Nigel Dudley,Aaron G.

Kubu Raya and Pontianak Districts of West Kalimantan rely their future agricultural development on this environmentally fragile peatland because of the dominance (58% and 16% area, respectively) of this land in the two districts. A study aimed to evaluate land use changes on peatland and to develop strategies for sustainable peatland use and management for agriculture. Time series satellite imageries of land use and land cover, ground truthing, and statistical data of land use change were analyzed for generating the dynamics of land use changes in the period of 1986-2008. Field observation, peat sampling, and peat analyses of representative land use types were undertaken to assess peat characteristics and its agricultural suitability. The study showed that within 22 years (1986-2008), the area of peat forests in Kubu Raya and Pontianak Districts decreased as much as 13.6% from 391,902 ha to 328,078 ha. The current uses of the peatland in the two districts include oil palm plantation (8704 ha), smallholder rubber plantation (13,186 ha), annual crops (15,035 ha), mixed cropping of trees and annual crops (22,328 ha), and pineapple farming (11,744 ha). Our evaluation showed unconformity of the current uses of peatland with regulations and crops agronomic requirements such as peat thickness and maturity, rendering unsustainability. This study recommends that expansion of agriculture and plantation on peatland areas be limited over idle land within the agricultural production and conversion production forest areas. About 34,362 ha (9.7%) of uncultivated log-over forest and shrubs can potentially be developed for agriculture. Peat soils with the thickness of >3 m should be allocated for conservation or forest protection due to low inherent soil fertility and high potential greenhouse gas emissions if converted for agriculture.","Soil fertility,Peat,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Land cover,Forest protection,Environmental science,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Slash-and-burn,Peat,Land use,Tropical peatland,Sustainability,Peat,Sustainable management,Shifting cultivation,Peat,Sowing,Peat,Morphology (linguistics),Peat,Oil palm,Environmental science,Water table,Soil water,Soil test","Wahyunto Wahyunto,Wahyu Supriatna,Fahmuddin Agus,F.

Difficulties arise when specifying the nature of intangible values, but more significantly when it comes to relating intangible values to ecosystem functions. After setting out some conceptual issues, this paper uses a case study on the German North Sea coast to illustrate ways of operationalising the concept in a marine context. Based on a survey of local residents, we first identify current CES in the sea and the intangible values associated with them. Seascape and place emerge as useful conceptual bridges linking ecosystem functioning outcomes to key CES values. We then relate this to offshore wind farming, which some residents perceive as a significant threat to certain CES. Although the approach presented increases the visibility of intangible ecosystem values, the problem remains that such assessments are temporal, in need of added calibration and do not automatically put intangibles on a par with market ecosystem value.","Seascape,Offshore wind power,German,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem valuation,Ecosystem services,Ecosystem health,Ecosystem,Ecology,Biology,Agriculture,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Sociology,Qualitative research,Qualitative interviewing,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Taskscape,Sociology,Social science,Valuation (finance),Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Impact factor,Human welfare,Environmental resource management,Valuation (finance),Total economic value,Natural resource management,World Ocean Circulation Experiment,Total inorganic carbon,Revelle factor,Strategic planning,Sketch,Natural capital,Valuation (finance),The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity,Natural capital","Kira Gee,Benjamin Burkhard,Robert Costanza,Rudolf de Groot,Stephen Farberk,Monica Grasso,Bruce Hannon,Jill K.

From a broad perspective, this study provides a better understanding of innovation activity mediated by social media--particularly the government's Twitter activity, a topic that has not been addressed by previous webometric research on Triple Helix relationships--by employing social network analysis and content analysis. The results indicate some limitations of the MFAFF's activity on Twitter as a mutual communication channel, although Twitter has the potential to facilitate risk management. Further, based on the MFAFF's confined use of its Twitter account, the results suggest that its Twitter account can be an effective information distribution channel, indicating Twitter's value as a communication tool for innovation activity through social media.

The standardised regression coefficient has revealed that irrigation (42%) and farm power (32%) significantly contributed in increasing the yield. Both these inputs use mechanical and electrical energy extensively as a part of mechanisation. An index has been suggested based on the ratio of the cost of use of machinery to the total animate and machinery cost for the estimation of the mechanisation. State-level crop-wise secondary data have been adopted from the cost of cultivation of principal crops in India for the assessment of the mechanisation index, and to study its impact on the yield, cost of cultivation and deployment of human and animal power. The analysis has revealed that the human labour cost is still the largest component in the cost of cultivation in the wheat crop, which is the most highly mechanised crop in India. The analysis has further revealed that, although 78·5% farm power was contributed by the mechanical sources, the mechanisation index based on cost of use of machinery was 14·5%. In other words, the share of cost of the human and animal energy in the total operational cost was 85·5%. The crop-wise mechanisation index varied from a lowest value of 8·22% in sorghum and paddy to a highest value of 30% in wheat. The analysis also revealed that the states having higher mechanisation indices incurred a lower cost of cultivation of the wheat crop on quintal basis due to increased yield. As the level of mechanisation increased, the draught animal use significantly reduced annually by 6·2%, but use of human labour reduced by −0·18% only, from 1971–72 to 1996–97.","Waste management,Sorghum,Operations management,Mechanization,Irrigation,Crop,Chemistry,Capital investment,Animal use,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Agricultural productivity,Waste management,Total energy,Mechanization,Technical progress,Operations research,Mechanization","Gyanendra Singh,G.

411,"Conservation in tropical landscape mosaics: the case of the cacao landscape of southern Bahia, Brazil",2011-01-01,Biodiversity and Conservation,10.1007/S10531-011-0052-X,"A recent debate has contrasted two conservation strategies in agricultural landscapes; either “land sparing” farm development combining intensive production practices with forest set-asides, or “wildlife-friendly” farming with greater on-farm habitat value but lower yields. We argue that in established mosaic landscapes including old cacao production regions where natural forest has already been reduced to relatively small fragments, a combination of both strategies is needed to conserve biodiversity. After reviewing the evidence for the insufficiency of either strategy alone if applied to such landscapes, the paper focuses on the cacao production landscape of southern Bahia, Brazil, once the world’s second largest cacao producer. Here, small remaining areas of Atlantic Forest are embedded in a matrix dominated by traditional cacao agroforests, resulting in a landscape mosaic that has proven favorable to the conservation of the region’s high biodiversity. We show that current land use dynamics and public policies pose threats but also offer opportunities to conservation and describe a three-pronged landscape conservation strategy, consisting of (i) expansion of the protected areas system, (ii) promotion of productive yet biodiversity-friendly cacao farming practices, and (iii) assistance to land users to implement legally mandated on-farm reserves and voluntary private reserves. We discuss recent experiences concerning the implementation of this strategy, discuss likely future scenarios, and reflect on the applicability of the Bahian experience to biodiversity rich cacao production regions elsewhere in the tropics.","Tropics,Public policy,Landscape-scale conservation,Land use,Habitat,Ecology,Biology,Biodiversity,Atlantic forest,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Umbrella species,Regional Red List,Red List Index,Species richness,Species distribution,Spatial distribution,Wildlife conservation,Land management,Habitat,Tropics,Resource management,Landscape ecology,Shade-grown coffee,Habitat,Ecology,Secondary forest,Protected area,Old-growth forest,Rainforest,Livelihood,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Tropics,Tropical agriculture,Theobroma,Old-growth forest,Habitat,Fragmentation (computing),Species richness,Secondary forest,Old-growth forest","Götz Schroth,Deborah Faria,Marcelo Araujo,Lucio Bede,Norman Myers,Russell A.

The Hawai’i Biocomplexity Project has used the Hawaiian archipelago and more specifically the Leeward Kohala Field System (LKFS) as a model system to investigate the dynamic, often non-linear interactions among soils, agricultural systems, populations, and sociopolitical systems over time scales of several centuries. Two major models have been developed: (1) a model of spatial and temporal variability in agricultural production; and (2) a model of food availability and its linkages to population fertility and mortality. Empirically derived field data were used both to parameterize the models, and to test their predictions. Archaeological data on the distribution and variation in ancient agricultural field infrastructure, derived from high-resolution LiDAR images, were used to test predictions of agricultural production and intensity. Similarly, chronological data on numbers of ancient households derived from archaeological excavation and radiocarbon dating were used to test model predictions of population growth over time. This iterative process of building and testing models has led to improved understanding of how pre-industrial agricultural systems were intensified, and how expansion and intensification were dynamically linked to demographic changes in farming populations.","Sustainability,Population growth,Population,Field system,Ecology,Biology,Biocomplexity,Archipelago,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Variable-order Bayesian network,Stochastic modelling,Statistical inference,Water content,Total organic carbon,Soil temperature,Nutrient cycle,Model system,Environmental science,Sociology,Prehistory,Paleodemography,Water balance,Vadose zone,Soil water,Monarchy,Kingdom,History,Wetland,Tropics,Soil fertility,Wetland,Tonne,Soil fertility,Population,Holocene,Historical ecology,Subdivision,Spatial distribution,Radiocarbon dating","P.V.

In the early days, after the formation of Pakistan, its survival and future was under a great deal of skepticism. Therefore, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) took initiatives for agricultural growth and development in the mid-1960’s, which later on became a revolution, commonly known as the Green Revolution. The present study aims to explore the environmental consequences of the Green Revolution by testing a hypothesis. Our H0 states that there is no trade-off between agricultural growth (proxy variable for economic growth) and carbon dioxide emissions in case of Pakistan, based on the annual data on variables (such as GHG emissions and Index of agriculture, GDP, etc.) from 1960 to 1990. Johansen’s method of cointegration has been employed in this study to test H0. This method has an advantage over Phillips-Ouliaris’ and Engle-Granger’s methods of cointegration, in that it has the ability to estimate more than one cointegrating relationship between variables. Results of the present study do not support the existence of EKC hypothesis in relation to the Green Revolution, neither in the short run nor in the long run. None of the factors that led to the Green Revolution significantly contributed to the CO 2 emissions; however, the Green Revolution resulted in an increase in the GDP of Pakistan. This shows that the agricultural sector of Pakistan can provide better earning opportunities besides having the potential for climate change mitigation. The present scenario in Pakistan necessitates the need for the government to focus on climate change mitigation and adaptation policies through the agricultural sector. Moreover, effective implementation of such policies using economic instruments, such as charges and subsidies, especially against the polluting industries, should be encouraged.","Sustainable development,Kuznets curve,Greenhouse gas,Green Revolution,Global warming,Economics,Development economics,Cointegration,Climate change mitigation,Agriculture,Unit root,Statistics,Random walk,Pollution haven hypothesis,Pollutant,Per capita income,Time lag,Per capita income,Macroeconomics,Service economy,Per capita income,Kuznets curve,Natural resource,Kuznets curve,International trade,Real gross domestic product,Per capita,Macroeconomics,Short run,Panel data,Income elasticity of demand,Kuznets curve,International trade,International economics,Soil organic matter,Organic farming,Manure management,Short run,Openness to experience,Macroeconomics","Ghaffar Ali,Aqdas Ashraf,Muhammad Khalid Bashir,Shenghui Cui,David A.

This study aimed to correct for this market failure by establishing a regionally-scaled market-based payment scheme for ecosystem services. Payments to farmers were linked to ecological goods representing differently ranked quality-levels of vascular plant diversity that were used as proxies for ecological services derived from managed grasslands. To reward the provision of ecological goods, we designed a novel market-based payment scheme that comprised a combination of a payment by results approach with an auction mechanism. Our results demonstrated that an appropriately designed payment scheme at a regional scale could support farming systems that are managed for delivering ecological goods in addition to the production of market goods such as food and fibre. Hence, instead of maximising economic profit through high-input management practices farmers within the case-study region had, for the first time, the possibility to diversify their total income risk by producing verifiable ecological goods of grassland plant diversity.","Ranking,Profit (economics),Payment by Results,Payment,Market failure,Incentive,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Biology,Agriculture,Valuation (finance),Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Psychological resilience,Natural resource economics,Global environmental analysis,Geography,Ecosystem diversity,Ecosystem,Total human ecosystem,Measurement of biodiversity,Environmental resource management,Wildlife conservation,Species richness,Landscape-scale conservation,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource,Need to know,Natural resource management,Environmental resource management,Vickrey auction,Spectrum auction,Reverse auction,Psychological intervention,Priority setting,Natural resource economics,Vegetation,Umbrella species,Measurement of biodiversity","Sebastian Klimek,Anne Richter gen.

The objective of this article is to revise this open debate and attempt to introduce more concerns about the delimitation of theories and the mosaic of rural areas in Europe. In this context the present article analyses the paradigmatic development of Almeria (south-east Spain) based primarily on agriculture in a process categorised as an economic miracle. Some authors have attempted to explain this success by mechanisms associated with the endogenous development approach. Nevertheless, this study reveals that Almeria's development experience can be categorised as a miscellaneous one, and a mixture of development approaches should therefore be considered as opposed to unidirectional models. This also shows the importance of keeping open the debate on the impact of agrarian activity on rural development.","South east,Sociology,Social science,Rural development,Rural area,Regional science,Economy,Economic miracle,Development experience,Almeria,Agriculture,Agrarian society,Socioeconomics,Rural economics,Regional economics,Spatial planning,Sociology,Social science,Subsidiary,Semiconductor industry,Pathology,Public policy,Normative,Lagging,Sociology,Social science,Social exclusion,Stakeholder engagement,Sociology,Social science,Water use,Water trading,Water supply,Rural development,Rhetoric,Regional studies,Rural policy,Rural area,Productivism,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Social science","Emilio Galdeano-Gómez,José A.

The purpose of this study was to identify the factors affecting farmer participation in irrigation management using survey research. The study was conducted in Doroodzan Dam Irrigation Network in Fars province, Iran. Multistage stratified random sampling was used to collect data from 270 farmers as the research sample. Results reveal that farmers' attitudes toward participation in irrigation management, attitudes toward personnel of the State Water Authority and the Agricultural Extension Service Centers (AESCs), family size, the problem perception, dependence on the dam for water, and educational background have influenced their participation in irrigation management. By contrast, contact with information sources, animal units, sociability, age and agricultural experience did not affect farmers' participation. Moreover, based on farmers' perspectives, unequal water distribution among farms, dissatisfaction with Water Authority operators and high water fees and charges were the main problems and obstacles toward farmer participation in irrigation management.","Water authority,Stratified sampling,Middle East,Irrigation management,Irrigation,Hydrology,Hydraulic engineering,Economics,Agriculture,Agricultural extension,Strengths and weaknesses,Social capital,Rural development,West indies,Socioeconomics,Participatory management,Water resources,Water resource management,Sustainable management,Woodland,Wildlife,Reino unido,Water resource management,Turkish,Participatory management,Water table,Water storage,Water resources,Social science,Habitat,Environmental resource management,Marketing,Land allocation,General education,Utility model,Subsidy,Social status,Typology,Sustainable agriculture,Socioeconomics","Taher Azizi Khalkheili,Gholam Hosein Zamani,Ruth Meinzen-Dick,Monica DiGregorio,Nancy McCarthy,Frito Dolisca,Douglas R.

TFP fell 3% after the Korean 1997 financial crisis. We find evidence that the large fall in TFP is mostly due to a sectoral reallocation of labor from the more productive manufacturing and construction sectors to the less productive wholesale trade sector, the public sector and agriculture. We construct a two-sector model that accounts for the labor reallocation. The model has a consumption sector and an investment sector. Firms face sector-specific working capital constraints, which we calibrate with data from financial statements. The rise in interest rates makes inputs more costly. The model accounts for 42% of the TFP fall. The model also accounts for 53% of the fall in GDP. It is broadly consistent with the post-crisis behavior of the Korean economy.","Working capital,Total factor productivity,Sudden stop,Small open economy,Public sector,Macroeconomics,Labour economics,Interest rate,Financial crisis,Economics,Agriculture,Portfolio,Net foreign assets,Net asset value,Stock dilution,Self-employment,Measures of national income and output,Sovereign default,Small open economy,Real interest rate,Small open economy,Monetary policy,Monetary economics,Microeconomics,Investment goods,Information technology,Stylized fact,Postponement,Microeconomics,Economics,Economic growth,Sudden stop,Monetary economics,Microeconomics,Working capital,Tobin's q,Monetary economics,Stochastic process,Return on investment,Relative price","David M.

Soils, rice, and vegetables from Chenzhou City, Southern China were sampled and analyzed. In the surface soils, the 95% confidence interval for the mean concentration of Cd varied between 2.72 and 4.83 mg/kg (P < 0.05) in the survey, with a geometric mean concentration of 1.45 mg/kg. Based on the GIS map, two hot spot areas of Cd in agricultural soils with high Cd concentrations were identified to be located around the Shizhuyuan, Jinshiling, and Yaogangxian mines, and the Baoshan and Huangshaping mines, in the center of the city. About 60% of the total investigated area, where the agricultural soil Cd concentration is above 1 mg/kg, is distributed in a central belt across the region. The critical distances, at which the soil Cd concentration were increased by the mining activities, from the mines of the soils were 23 km for the Baoshan mine, 46 km for the Huangshaping mine, and 63 km for the Shizhuyuan mine, respectively. These are distances calculated from models. The Cd concentrations in rice samples ranged from 0.01 to 4.43 mg/kg and the mean dietary Cd intake from rice for an adult was 191 µg/d. Results of risk indexes showed that soil Cd concentrations possessed risks to local residents whose intake of Cd from rice and vegetables grown in soils in the vicinity of the mine was 596 µg/d.","Veterinary medicine,Soil water,Soil contamination,Population,Health risk,Environmental engineering,Contamination,Chromatography,Chemistry,Cadmium pollution,Cadmium,Agriculture,Organic chemistry,Ochratoxin A,Maltol,Medicine,Environmental health,Toxicology,Toxicity,Renal tubular dysfunction,Tailings,String bean,Sorghum,Snake gourd,Legume,Irrigation,Zinc,Trace metal,Soil water,World health,Waste management,Technical report,Trace metal,Trace element,Soil water,Soil water,Soil contamination,Population,Soil test,Oryza sativa,Mineralization (biology)","Limei Zhai,Xiaoyong Liao,Tongbin Chen,Xiulan Yan,Hua Xie,Bin Wu,Lixia Wang,Joint Fao,Bend J,Bolger M,Knaap Ag,Kuznesof Pm,Hem Kay,Soisungwan Satarug,Jason R Baker,Supanee Urbenjapol,Melissa Haswell-Elkins,Paul E.B Reilly,Hongyu Liu,Anne Probst,Bohan Liao,M.G.M.

Today, these characteristics are in decline when they are not destroyed, due to the changes in the land use management systems of the last 150 years, caused by developments in production and social structure. In this paper, the dynamics of the changes are examined on a specific Greek island. Lesvos, which has an economic and landscape history typical of many Mediterranean cases. Their economic development based on agriculture and food processing created a landscape with terraces and stonewalls, which is nowadays considered ‘traditional’. After some major political, economic and technological developments had reduced the competitiveness of Lesvos’s economy, population declined and landscape characteristics were degraded. The examination of these changes witha descriptive modelof landscape transformation offerssomeinsightin thedynamicsof landscapes and their characteristics in the Mediterranean today for present and future developments.","Population,Politics,Mediterranean climate,Landscape history,Landscape dynamics,Land use,Greek island,Environmental protection,Economics,Agriculture,Social anthropology,Part iii,Mediterranean climate,Prehistory,Mediterranean climate,Geography,Nature versus nurture,Mental management,Management practices,Sustainable development,Landscape planning,Landscape history,Landscape planning,Landscape history,Landscape epidemiology,Rural area,Marsh,Geography,The Renaissance,Narrative,Mediterraneanism,Sustainable agriculture,Natural resource economics,Geography,Landscape design,Landscape architecture,Geography,Wildlife,Vegetation,Making-of","Thanasis Kizos,Maria Koulouri,Peregrine Horden,Nicholas Purcell,A.

We facilitated workshops in the Mixteca Alta region of Oaxaca, Mexico, in which groups of small farmers described how they had adapted to and prepared for past climate challenges. Farmers reported that their cropping systems were changing for multiple reasons: more drought, later rainfall onset, decreased rural labor, and introduced labor-saving technologies. Examination of climate data found that farmers’ climate narratives were largely consistent with the observational record. There have been increases in temperature and rainfall intensity, and an increase in rainfall seasonality that may be perceived as later rainfall onset. Farmers also identified 14 indicators that they subsequently used to evaluate the condition of their agroecosystems. Farmers ranked landscape-scale indicators as more marginal than farmer management or soil quality indicators. From this analysis, farmers proposed strategies to improve the ability of their agroecosystems to cope with climatic variability. Notably, they recognized that social organizing and education are required for landscape-scale indicators to be improved. This outcome suggests that climate change adaptation by small farmers involves much more than just a set of farming practices, but also community action to tackle collective problems.","Soil quality,Rainfed agriculture,Participatory action research,Economics,Cropping,Climate change,Agroforestry,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Agriculture,Precipitation,Meteorology,Mean radiant temperature,World map,Humanities,Global precipitation,Water resources,Mathematics,Econometrics,Water transport,Water cycle,Rain gauge,Geography,Agroforestry,Agricultural science,Southern Hemisphere,Northern Hemisphere,Longitude,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant,Tropical pacific,Southern oscillation,Single variable,Sociology,Focus group,Developmental psychology,Small-scale agriculture,Psychological resilience,Global warming","Paul Rogé,Andrew Ronald Friedman,Marta Astier,Miguel A.

We studied the Relationship Coffee Model (RCM), a business model that supports longâ€ term partnerships between coffee buyers and smallholders based on product quality. We examined how biophysical conditions and production practices affect smallholdersâ€™ ability to participate in this model. Furthermore, we considered common unobservable variables driving growersâ€™ participation such as farm soil quality and connection to social networks. In turn, we evaluated key environmental, socioâ€ economic and technological outcomes, including tree and bird population diversity. Our estimations indicated that RCM participants employed more sustainable resource management practices, had better access to credit and were more informed and optimistic about the coffee business. However, we did not find significant farmâ€ gate price differences.

The increased use of the agricultural biomass can help the agricultural based societies in achieving energy security and creating employment without causing environmental degradation. But, the viability and feasibility of electricity generation from agricultural biomass depends upon the availability of biomass supply at a competitive cost. The present study investigates the availability of agricultural biomass for distributed power generation in Punjab. The total production of the crop residues has been estimated by residue-to-product ratio (RPR) method. Further, the restrictions introduced by competitive uses as well as harvesting practices are taken into considerations to evaluate the available biomass potential. The biomass power potential has been obtained on considerations of energy contents of the particular crop residues and selecting appropriate conversion route. A total of 55.396Mt of the agricultural residues are produced from various major crops. Out of these, 22.315Mt (40.17%) of the agricultural biomass has been found to be surplus with an average density of 443t/km2. These surplus residues can significantly be used to provide continuous, reliable and sustainable fuel supply for power plants. Cereals (rice, wheat, maize and barley) have major contribution (74.67%) in the surplus biomass, followed by cotton (25.01%) and sugarcane (0.2%). The estimated annual bio-energy potential of unused crop residues is 0.35EJ (8.43% of India’s potential), which is equivalent to 1.43% India’s annual primary energy consumption. It has been revealed that a power potential of 2000–3000MW can be exploited from these resources depending upon thermal efficiency. The study concludes with a discussion on significance and challenges of decentralized electricity generation for rural energy supply, including brief description about economical, social, environmental and technical aspects of bioelectricity.","Waste management,Renewable energy,Power station,Engineering,Energy supply,Energy security,Crop residue,Biomass,Biofuel,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural engineering,Waste management,Renewable resource,Renewable energy,Tropics,Soot,Global warming,Zero-energy building,Wind power,Renewable heat,Proximate,Moisture,Mineralogy,Waste-to-energy,Waste management,Renewable fuels,Wood gas,Waste treatment,Waste management,Waste management,Sulfur dioxide,Slag,Waste management,Staged combustion,Soot,Waste management,Tar,Supply chain management,Waste management,Statistics,Singular spectrum analysis","Jaswinder Singh,Peter McKendry,V.

433,Quantifying the economic impact of soil constraints on Australian agriculture: A case‐study of wheat,2018-01-01,Land Degradation & Development,10.1002/LDR.3130,"Soil sodicity, acidity, and salinity are important soil constraints to wheat production in many cropping regions across Australia, and the Australian agricultural industry needs accurate information on their economic impacts to guide investment decisions on remediation and minimize productivity losses. We present a modelling framework that maps the effects of soil constraints on wheat yield, quantifying forfeited wheat yields due to specific soil constraints at a broad spatial scale and assessing the economic benefit of managing these constraints. Of the three soil constraints considered (sodicity, acidity, and salinity), sodicity caused the largest magnitude of yield gaps across most of the wheat‐cropping areas of Australia, with an average yield gap of 0.13 t ha⁻¹yr⁻¹. Yield gaps due to acidity were more concentrated spatially in the high‐rainfall regions of Western Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales, and averaged 0.04 t ha⁻¹yr⁻¹ across the wheat‐cropping areas of Australia, whereas the yield gap due to salinity was estimated to be 0.02 t ha⁻¹yr⁻¹. The lost opportunity associated with soil sodicity for wheat production was estimated to be worth A$1,300 million per annum, for soil acidity, A$400 million per annum, and for salinity, A$200 million per annum. The results of this work should prove useful to guide national investment decisions on the allocation of resources and to target areas where more detailed information would be required in order to reduce the yield gap associated with soil constraints on wheat yields in Australia.","Yield gap,Soil salinity,Soil pH,Salinity,Geology,Environmental remediation,Economic impact analysis,Cropping,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Smoothing spline,Multivariate interpolation,Missing data,Systems simulation,Simulation modelling,Simulation,Yield gap,Population,Land use,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Good agricultural practice,Food systems,Subsoil,Soil water,Soil salinity,Vegetation,Thematic Mapper,Temperate deciduous forest,Ustic,Ultisol,Udic moisture regime,Simulation modeling,Scaling,Satellite data,Water table,Subsoil,Sodic soil,Variogram,Statistics,Poisson distribution","Thomas G.

This article presents a sustainability assessment based on the FAO SAFA (Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems) of six selected family farms representing three types of family farming systems (with only family labour; with hired labour; and with hired labour and a 'middleman in marketing system'). Individual structured interviews based on the SAFA guidelines were conducted and the results analysed with the SAFA Tool software. The results showed that the SAFA sustainability performance generally scored better in the farming system with relatively more resources and hired labour, and the household head also working as middleman, as compared to the other two farming systems with some or no hired labour. These results indicate that the larger room for sustainability improvement relies in the farming systems with only family labour. Lack of information, training and economical resources showed to be two main drivers that explain part of these differences. These results suggest that the government’s role in increasing awareness, providing information and training and facilitating sustainable development practices is critical.","Sustainable development,Sustainability,Market system,Government,Business,Beef cattle,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Weak and strong sustainability,Sustainable development,Sustainability science,Water scarcity,Water resources,Livestock,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Stakeholder,Triple bottom line,Sustainability science,Sustainability organizations,Triple bottom line,Terminology,Sustainable development,Valuation (finance),Sustainability,Public good,Sustainable development,Socioeconomics,Mixed farming,Sustainable development,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Stakeholder,Sustainability science,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability","Siwi Gayatri,Vincent Gasso-tortajada,Mette Vaarst,Gro Harlem Brundtland,Mansour Khalid,H.

The synergistic fusion of the surface soil moisture (SSM) from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived land surface temperature (LST), and water/vegetation indices for agricultural drought monitoring was tested. The rationale of the approach is based on the inverse relationship between LST, vegetation condition and soil moisture content. Thus, the proposed Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index (SMADI) combines the soil and temperature conditions while including the lagged response of vegetation. SMADI was retrieved every eight days at 500 m spatial resolution for the whole Iberian Peninsula (IP) from 2010 to 2014, and a time lag of eight days was used to account for the plant response to the varying soil/climatic conditions. The results of SMADI compared well with other agricultural indices in a semiarid area in the Duero basin, in Spain, and also with a climatic index in areas of the Iberian Peninsula under contrasted climatic conditions. Based on a standard classification of drought severity, the proposed index allowed for a coherent description of the drought conditions of the IP during the study period.","Water content,Vegetation,Time lag,Salinity,Remote sensing,Peninsula,Normalized Difference Vegetation Index,Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer,Hydrology,Geology,Agriculture,Water content,Soil map,Satellite,Vegetation,Sea surface temperature,Satellite,Vegetation,Spectral imaging,Spectral bands,Vegetation,Spatial variability,Remote sensing,Vegetation,Regression analysis,Normalized Difference Vegetation Index,Vegetation stress,Vegetation,Remote sensing,Vegetation stress,Vegetation Index,Vegetation,Vegetation,Remote sensing,Reflectivity,Vegetation Index,Short wave infrared,Normalized difference water index,Water content,VNIR,Soil water","Nilda Sánchez,Ángel González-Zamora,María Piles,José Martínez-Fernández,Dara Entekhabi,Eni G Njoku,Peggy E O'Neill,Kent H Kellogg,Wade T Crow,Yann H Kerr,Philippe Waldteufel,Jean-Pierre Wigneron,Steven Delwart,François Cabot,Bo-cai Gao,Inge Sandholt,Kjeld Rasmussen,Jens Asger Andersen,Arnon Karnieli,Nurit Agam,Rachel T.

436,The implications of phasing out conventional nutrient supply in organic agriculture: Denmark as a case,2013-01-01,Organic agriculture,10.1007/S13165-013-0045-Z,"Soil fertility management in organic systems, regulated by the organic standards, should seek to build healthy, fertile soils and reduce reliance on external inputs. The use of nutrients from conventional sources, such as animal manures from conventional farms, is currently permitted, with restrictions, in the organic regulations. However, the reliance of organic agriculture on the conventional system is considered problematic. In light of this, the organic sector in Denmark has recently decided to gradually phase out, and ultimately ban, the use of conventional manures and straws in organic agriculture in Denmark. Core focal areas for phasing out conventional nutrients are as follows: (1) amendments to crop selection and rotations, (2) alternative nutrient sources (organic wastes) and (3) increased cooperation between organic livestock and arable farmers. Using Denmark as a case, this article discusses the background and implications of the strategy to phase out conventional manure and straw, and explores possible solutions to the challenge of ensuring a sustainable nutrient supply to organic systems. Alternative strategies to ensure nutrient supply will require a tapestry of small solutions. One element of this tapestry is to review the volume and type of nutrient sources available in alternative, non-farm organic waste streams and consider their suitability for use in organic systems.","Soil quality,Soil management,Organic farming,Nutrient management,Manure,Environmental science,Environmental protection,Biodegradable waste,Arable land,Agronomy,Agriculture,Scarcity,Phosphorus,Phosphorite,Waste management,Soil quality,Sludge,Waste management,Waste disposal,Triclocarban,Soil structure,Soil horizon,Soil conditioner,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Soil fertility,Soil water,Soil quality,Organic matter,Soil water,Soil quality,Soil organic matter,Soil structure,Soil quality,Soil biology,Waste management,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Waste management,Trace element,Seasonality","Myles Oelofse,Lars Stoumann Jensen,Jakob Magid,Dana Cordell,Jan-Olof Drangert,Stuart White,Stephen R.

An international working group (including statutory agencies, NGO representatives and experts) agreed on objectives and actions to maintain the population in favourable conservation status, while accounting for biodiversity, economic and recreational interests. Agreements include setting a population target to reduce agricultural conflicts and avoid tundra degradation, and using hunting in some range states to maintain stable population size. As part of the adaptive management procedures, adjustment to harvest is made annually subject to population status. This has required streamlining of monitoring and assessment activities. Three years after implementation, indicators suggest the attainment of management results.

438,Economic analysis of biogas adoption technology by rural farmers: The case of Faisalabad district in Pakistan,2017-01-01,Renewable Energy,10.1016/J.RENENE.2017.01.060,"This study attempts to estimate the economics of biogas plants in Faisalabad District and identify the factors affecting the adoption of biogas technology. The key stakeholders of the biogas plant are farmers. Primary data from 160 respondents having biogas plants of 4 m3, 6 m3, 8 m3, 10 m3, 15 m3, 20 m3 and 25 m3 from villages in Faisalabad was collected through stratified random sampling, using questionnaires. A benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is employed to estimate the financial benefits. A Logit model is used to analyze the factors affecting adoption of biogas plants. Results showed that BCR values are greater than 1 for biogas plants of all sizes. The most feasible size for a plant is 10 m3 because it fulfills the cooking needs of an average family. However, small farmers with plant size of 4 m3 benefit more than large farmers. Moreover, biogas adoption is not only financially feasible but environment-friendly as well. We conclude that biogas technology can be popularized by developing effective motivation strategies such as awareness through public service advertizing, through print and electronic media and by adoption of models of biogas plants best suited to the conditions of rural people in Pakistan. This further highlights the demand for the required policy framework to promote such renewable energy adoption technologies by local government and agricultural institutions, researchers, and policy makers.","Waste management,Stratified sampling,Renewable energy,Public service,Local government,Engineering,Electronic media,Cost–benefit analysis,Biogas,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Unit-weighted regression,Statistics,Regression analysis,Waste-to-energy,Waste management,Renewable fuels,Wildlife protection,Natural resource economics,Lucid dream,Waste management,Renewable energy,Market penetration,Microeconomics,Gross domestic product,Granger causality,Waste management,Raw material,Payback period,Market penetration,Incentive,Household income,Waste management,Renewable energy,Population,Manure,Greenhouse gas,Global warming,Waste management,Supply chain,Secondary sector of the economy","Tahir Abbas,Ghaffar Ali,Sultan Ali Adil,Muhammad Khalid Bashir,Muhammad Asif Kamran,David W.

The case of fruit and vegetable farming in northern Thailand,2012-01-01,Agriculture and Human Values,10.1007/S10460-012-9378-6,"In response to the chronic overuse and misuse of pesticides in agriculture, governments in Southeast Asia have sought to improve food safety by introducing public standards of good agricultural practices (GAP). Using quantitative farm-level data from an intensive horticultural production system in northern Thailand, we test if fruit and vegetable producers who follow the public GAP standard use fewer and less hazardous pesticides than producers who do not adhere to the standard. The results show that this is not the case. By drawing on qualitative data from expert interviews and an action research project with local litchi (“lychee”) producers we explain the underlying reasons for the absence of significant differences. The qualitative evidence points at poor implementation of farm auditing related to a program expansion that was too rapid, at a lack of understanding among farmers about the logic of the control points in the standard, and at a lack of alternatives given to farmers to manage their pest problems. We argue that by focusing on the testing of farm produce for pesticide residues, the public GAP program is paying too much attention to the consequences rather than the root cause of the pesticide problem; it needs to balance this by making a greater effort to change on-farm practices.","Vegetable farming,Socioeconomics,Root cause,Qualitative property,Good agricultural practice,Food safety,Economics,Economic growth,Audit,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Action research,Transparency (graphic),Sociology,Public administration,Trade diversion,Trade agreement,Safety standards,Natural resource,International trade,Food systems,Surface water,Pollution,Pesticide,Tariff,International trade,Gravity model of trade,Value chain,Public economics,Primary research,Sustainable development,Market access,International development,Pyrethroid,Pesticide,Parathion,Subsidiarity,Scientism,Public relations,Vietnamese,River delta,Pesticide residue","Pepijn Schreinemachers,Iven Schad,Prasnee Tipraqsa,Pakakrong M.

However, only a few scientists have reported using LARS to monitor crop conditions. Moreover, there have been concerns regarding the feasibility of such systems for producers given the issues related to the post-processing of images, technical expertise, and timely delivery of information. The purpose of this study is to showcase actual requests by farmers to monitor crop conditions in their fields using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Working in collaboration with farmers in northeastern Ontario, we use optical and near-infrared imagery to monitor fertilizer trials, conduct crop scouting and map field tile drainage. We demonstrate that LARS imagery has many practical applications. However, several obstacles remain, including the costs associated with both the LARS system and the image processing software, the extent of professional training required to operate the LARS and to process the imagery, and the influence from local weather conditions (e.g. clouds, wind) on image acquisition all need to be considered. Consequently, at present a feasible solution for producers might be the use of LARS service provided by private consultants or in collaboration with LARS scientific research teams.","Remote sensing,Professional development,Precision agriculture,Ontario canada,Medicine,Low altitude,Image processing software,Image acquisition,Agriculture,Workflow,Satellite imagery,Remote sensing,Remote sensing,Poison control,Photochemical Reflectance Index,Stomatal conductance,Spectral resolution,Spectral bands,Stereoscopy,Remote sensing,Radiometry,Winter wheat,Remote sensing,Payload,Vegetation,Remote sensing,Pixel,Weed control,Weed,Satellite,Vineyard,Vegetation canopy,Spectrometer,Wetland,Riparian zone,Hydrology (agriculture),Remote sensing,Precision agriculture,Engineering","Chunhua Zhang,Dan Walters,John M.

The case of chipped pruned branches (CPB) in Mediterranean citrus plantations,2018-01-01,Land Use Policy,10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2017.12.052,"There is a need to devise management strategies that control soil and water losses in agriculture land to allow the design of proper policies to achieve sustainability. It is the responsibility of scientists to work with other actors to co-construct strategies that will lead to sustainable land-use policies. Using chipped pruned branches (CPB) as mulch can be a viable option because they represent local (in situ) organic material that can restore soil nutrients and organic matter. This research assesses: i) the perception of farmers towards different types of management strategies and CPB’s costs; ii) the biomass yield of citrus branches and the impact of CPB on soil properties; iii) how CPB affects soil erosion and runoff generation in citrus plantations; and, iv) a discussion about how to favour the use of CPB thought successful policies. To achieve those goals we carried out: i) one-hundred interviews to assess the perception of farmers and twelve interviews to assess the economic balance of twelve land owners; ii) soil was sampled at 0–2 and 4–6 cm depths; iii) pruned material was surveyed for 40 trees; and iv) forty rainfall simulation experiments (55 mm h−1) were carried out in two citrus plantations at paired sites (Control versus CPB), in La Costera District in Eastern Spain. Forty circular (0.25 m2) plots were installed in four rows (4 × 5 = 20 plots) in control (CON) and CPB plots (20 + 20 = 40 plots) to perform the rainfall simulations over one hour. The cost of chipping ranged from 102 to 253 € ha−1, and was related to the size of the farm. The soil quality, runoff and erosion assessment showed that CPB is a suitable strategy. CPB increased organic matter from 1.3% to 2.9% after 10 years in the 0–2 cm depth layer, while the 4–6 cm layer was largely not affected (OM moved from 1.1 to 1.3% after 10 years), and soil bulk density showed a similar trend: a decrease from 1.36 to 1.16 g cm−3 in the surface layer with no change in the subsurface layer. The hydrological and erosional responses were different between CON and CPB. The CON plots initiated ponding (40 s) and runoff (107 s) earlier than the CPB plots (169 and 254 s, respectively); and runoff discharge was 60% in CON vs 43% in CPB plots. Sediment concentration was four times larger in the CON plots than in the CPB (11.3 g l−1 vs 3 g l−1), and soil erosion was 3.8 Mg ha−1 h-1 vs 0.7 Mg ha−1 h−1. CPB mulches were effective at controlling soil and water losses in Mediterranean citrus plantations as they showed the relationship between vegetation/litter cover and soil erosion rates. However, the farmer’s perception survey showed that the use of CPB was not welcomed nor accepted by the farmers. Policies that aim to promote CPB as soil conservation mulch need to be promoted by subsidies as the farmers requested, and by education to demonstrate the positive effects of CPB to of the farming community.","Vegetation,Surface runoff,Soil quality,Soil conservation,Mulch,Erosion,Environmental protection,Economics,Bulk density,Agronomy,Agriculture,World Reference Base for Soil Resources,USDA soil taxonomy,Subaqueous soil,Soil water,Soil texture,Soil series,Water scarcity,Sustainable development,Soil science,Joint research,Information needs,European union,Population,Natural resource economics,Liberalization,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Surface runoff,Surface runoff,Soil type,Soil organic matter,Surface runoff,Straw,Soil water,Water conservation,Tillage,Sustainability,WEPP,Vegetation type,Surface runoff","A.

Identifying the potential sources of MPs is necessary to diminish its pollution. In this study, the occurrence, composition and distribution of MPs in the influents and effluents from 9 domestic wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), 5 industrial WWTPs, wastewater of 10 industrial plants, 4 livestock farms and 4 fish ponds in China were investigated. Water samples were enzymatically treated followed by digestion with hydrogen peroxide and density separation. MPs were characterized using micro-Raman spectroscopy and were categorized by shape, size and color. Results showed that MP abundance in the influents and effluents of domestic WWTPs was 18–890 and 6–26 n·L−1, respectively, with the removal efficiency ranging from 35 to 98%. The effluents of industrial WWTPs contained 6–12 n·L−1 and the levels of MPs in the wastewater of industrial plants, livestock farms and fish ponds were in the range of 8–23, 8–40 and 13–27 n·L−1, respectively. No significant differences of MP abundance were demonstrated among effluents or wastewater of different sources, indicating they all constitute sources of MP pollution. Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) made up almost 83% of the total MPs. Fragment and film were the most abundant shapes and the majority of MPs were smaller than 500 μm. Polymer type and shape in different sources did not vary statistically, however, there were slight differences among different sources concerning size and color of MPs. This study could fill MP data gaps regarding different sources, guide future monitoring work and policy making.","Wastewater,Sewage treatment,Pulp and paper industry,Pollution,Microplastics,Human life,Effluent,Density separation,Chromatography,Chemistry,Agriculture,Waste management,Tonne,Plastic waste,Pollutant,Plastic pollution,Microplastics,Plastic pollution,Oceanography,Microplastics,Shore,Sewage,Population,Trophic level,Plastic pollution,Organism,Pollution,Plastic pollution,Oceanography,Potpourri,Plastic pollution,Litter,Trophic level,Plastic pollution,Neuston,Wastewater,Waste management,Sewage treatment,Sperm,Pacific oyster,Oyster","Fang Wang,Bin Wang,Lei Duan,Yizhe Zhang,Yitong Zhou,Qian Sui,Dongjiong Xu,Han Qu,Gang Yu,Roland Geyer,Jenna R.

The study aims to clarify farmers' intentions and decisions regarding global climate change adaptation. Logistic regression models were used to examine the influences of socioeconomic factors and climate adaptation communication processes on farmers' decision to apply adaptation strategies against drought and flood. Specifically, for a thorough understanding of non-adapting farmers, the theory of planned behavior was incorporated, to assess these farmers' intention to adaptation. Results showed that farmers' perceptions were consistent with the weather data over a short period, reporting a rise in temperature and a greater decrease in precipitation. Agricultural experience, farm income, training, social capital, and effective climate adaptation communication were statistically significant in increasing the probability of farmers' adaptation. For farmers who do not perceive climate change but adapted nonetheless, social capital played a major factor, driving their belief in, and behavior to adaptation, of which the most important aspects were neighbors and peer groups. Farmers' intention to adapt was mostly affected by perceived behavioral control factors, followed by attitude and subjective norms. Therefore, successful policies to enhance farmers' perceptions and adaptive capacity can encourage both actual and intended adaptation farmers. Adaptation strategies require the participation of multiple players from all related sectors engaging with local communities and farmers.","Theory of planned behavior,Socioeconomic status,Social capital,Global warming,Farm income,Environmental resource management,Economics,Climate change,Agriculture,Adaptive capacity,Theory of reasoned action,Theory of planned behavior,Technology acceptance model,Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology,Theory of reasoned action,Theory of planned behavior,Structure and function,Psychology,Humanities,Sustainable development,Public policy,Political economy of climate change,Population density,Poison control,Physical geography,Unconscious mind,Social psychology,Psychology,Sociology,Social psychology,Public relations,Tree planting,Subsistence agriculture,Soil conservation,Suicide prevention,Risk management,Public economics,Public policy,Political economy of climate change,Multiple cropping","Noppol Arunrat,Can Wang,Nathsuda Pumijumnong,Sukanya Sereenonchai,Wenjia Cai,Icek Ajzen,Martin Fishbein,Martin Fishbein,Icek Ajzen,Harold D.

Specific objectives were identification of improved agricultural technologies for Irish potatoes farming disseminated in the area; to determine extent of adoption of these technologies; and identification of factors influencing adoption. Study design was a crosssectional survey in two randomly selected villages from the ward in which 60 households were involved. Quantitative data from household heads were collected in the area using a structured questionnaire. In-depth interviews with extension officers were also carried out to obtain relevant data for the study. Results indicate that a range of improved agricultural technologies (eight technologies) have been disseminated in the area by extension agents. Extent of adoption among farmers varied with type of technology. Seeding rate, timely sowing and fungicide application were the highly adopted technologies. Each of these technologies was adopted by at least 80% of surveyed households. Improved varieties and pesticide application were used by 58% and 51% of the surveyed households, respectively and hence moderately adopted technologies. Least adopted technologies were recommended chemical fertilizer application rate as well as folial/booster fertilizer application which were used by nearly one- third of surveyed households, and recommended spacing which was not used by any of the surveyed households. Assessed by number of technologies adopted (overall adoption), results indicate half of surveyed households to have adopted not more than three out of eight of improved agricultural technologies for Irish potatoes disseminated in the area, reflecting poor overall adoption by a significant portion of surveyed households. Results for Multiple Linear Regression Analysis indicated that increased household income, being a male or married by a household head, increased farming experience, access to credit and extension services were positively and significantly associated with overall adoption. Based on these results recommendations for improving adoption have been indicated.","Tanzania,Solanum tuberosum,Rural district,Pesticide application,Multiple linear regression analysis,Irish,Household income,Biology,Agronomy,Agriculture,West africa,Tobit model,Subjective perception,Local government,Crop production,Business,Socioeconomics,Resource allocation,Male female,Soil fertility,Opportunity cost,Intercropping,Social engagement,Short duration,Land preparation,Odd ratio,Logistic regression,Limiting,Soil conservation,Socioeconomics,Rural area,Socioeconomic status,Reproductive health,Population,Sowing,Scarcity,Regression analysis,Innovation adoption,Emerging technologies,Biology","B.

This paper (i) quantifies the contribution that Vitellaria paradoxa makes to the total income of rural households belonging to different economic groups in two areas of Burkina Faso; (ii) quantifies the involvement of women in shea nuts and fruits collection and processing; and (iii) empirically verifies the “gap filling” function of shea products in Burkina Faso by quantifying the commercialization and subsistence use of shea fruits, nuts, and butter between agricultural seasons. Based on data collected from structured household surveys used on a quarterly basis during a one-year period on 536 households, we demonstrate that the reliance on shea is generally high in the sampled populations, and is at its highest for the poorest households, for which it contributes 12 % of total household income. Moreover, shea nut collection and processing was found to provide a valuable source of cash income to female household members who otherwise have very few income possibilities. Finally, due to its ecology, shea fills in an income gap during a period where human activities are at their highest while income is at its lowest. Although shea is crucial for poor people’s livelihoods and for the generation of income for women, its harvesting and processing are time-consuming activities that generate low returns per unit of labor. We argue that shea collection and processing should therefore not be considered as a remedy to poverty but instead as a way for households to diversify their livelihood strategy and decrease their vulnerability to food insecurity and climate variability.","West african,Vulnerability,Subsistence agriculture,Socioeconomics,Poverty,Livelihood,Household income,Gap filling,Environmental protection,Biology,Agronomy,Agriculture,Subsistence agriculture,Rural management,Rural economics,Rural area,Off-farm income,Nonfarm payrolls,Wood processing,Subsistence agriculture,Safety net,Welfare,Valuation (finance),Socioeconomics,Rural society,Plant species,Livelihood security,Valuation (finance),Strengths and weaknesses,Revealed preference,Welfare,Tobit analysis,Standard of living,Poverty,Population,Net national income,Sustainable forest management,Sustainability,Rural poverty,Non-timber forest product,Natural resource economics,Market value","Mariève Pouliot,Frank Ellis,Christopher B.

This article, utilizing a recent survey of China’s livestock industry, illustrates the initiating role of China’s developmental state in the exponential expansion of the country’s livestock production. The enthusiastic response of the livestock industry to the many state policy incentives has made China the world’s biggest animal farming nation. Shortage of meat and dairy supply is history. Yet, the Chinese government is facing new challenges of no less a threat to political stability. Production intensification has created a welfare crisis impacting the world’s biggest number of farm animals. The resulting food safety incidents are affecting consumer confidence and health. Untreated waste contributes to the nation’s environmental degradation. Developmental states may have a proud record of growth in the initial stage of industrialization. Their prospects for sustained development have long been questioned. China has come to an important juncture to march towards a sustained development.","Socioeconomics,Livestock,Industrialisation,Food safety,Environmental degradation,Economics,Economic growth,Developmental state,Development economics,China,Animal welfare,Agriculture,Political science,Developmental state,Developmental psychology,State action,Political science,Political economy,Torture,The Holocaust,Law,Wood shavings,Tail-biting,Stress level,Research model,Political science,Nursing ethics,Trade theory,Trade barrier,Salient,Political science,Political economy,Hegemony,Software deployment,Public economics,Policy studies,Socialism,Open economy,Market economy,Southeast asian,International political economy,Industrialisation","Peter J.

In Greece, it was ‘officially’ introduced through EU subsidies to Greek farmers or women's cooperatives in the 1980s and since then has grown significantly. This paper examines the nature of Greek agrotourism, whether it can be considered ‘real’ agrotourism, and its effects on farmers and farms. Evidence from three case studies (Lesvos, Magnesia and Lefkada) reveals the contradictory character of agrotourism development in Greece.

457,The impact of farming systems on soil biology and soilborne diseases: examples from the Australian sugar and vegetable industries – the case for better integration of sugarcane and vegetable production and implications for future research,2008-01-01,Australasian Plant Pathology,10.1071/AP07084,"A sugarcane farming system based on residue retention, minimum tillage, a leguminous rotation crop and controlled traffic using global positioning system guidance is currently being adopted by the Australian sugar industry because it improves sugar yields, reduces costs and provides additional income from crops such as soybean and peanut. This paper discusses the soil health improvements that are being obtained with this new farming system, particularly its beneficial effects on soil carbon levels and soil biological properties. It also summarises research showing that breaking the sugarcane monoculture with a soybean or peanut crop reduces populations of lesion nematode (Pratylenchus zeae) and root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne javanica), the two most important nematode pests of sugarcane. The role of minimum tillage and inputs of organic matter in enhancing the natural biological control mechanisms that suppress these nematodes is also discussed. The paper then considers the farming system currently used for vegetable crops such as tomato, capsicum and rockmelon, where inadequate crop rotation, excessive tillage, low organic inputs and the fallowing and solarisation effect of covering beds with plastic leads to a situation where soil fumigation is seen as the only option for reducing losses from soilborne pests and pathogens. Since the sugar industry coexists with the vegetable industry in some areas of Australia, the paper argues the case for developing minimum tillage practices for vegetable production and integrating them into the sugarcane farming system. It concludes that a farming system of this nature would improve profitability in both industries, produce better environmental outcomes at a landscape level and provide more sustainable solutions to nematode and soilborne disease problems.","Tillage,Pratylenchus zeae,Plant disease,No-till farming,Monoculture,Minimum tillage,Crop rotation,Botany,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Tropical agriculture,Radopholus similis,Pratylenchus zeae,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil organic matter,Soil functions,Plant pathology,Pasteuria penetrans,Pasteuria,Soil water,Soil structure,Soil organic matter,Soil classification,Relative species abundance,Nematode,Soil quality,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Weed,Trophic level,Tillage,Tillage,Strip-till,Soil fertility,Soil food web,Shoot,Rhizosphere,Sugar industry,Soil fertility,Environmental science","Graham R.

458,Barriers to implementing climate resilient agricultural strategies: The case of crop diversification in the U.S. Corn Belt,2017-01-01,Global Environmental Change-human and Policy Dimensions,10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2017.12.002,"Abstract Cropping system diversity can help build greater agroecosystem resilience by suppressing insect, weed, and disease pressures while also mitigating effects of extreme and more variable weather. Despite the potential benefits of cropping systems diversity, few farmers in the US Corn Belt use diverse rotations. This study examines factors that may influence farmers’ decisions to use more diversified crop rotations in the US Corn Belt through a parallel convergent mixed methods approach, using a multi-level analysis of Corn Belt farmer survey data (n = 4,778) and in-depth interviews (n = 159). Analyses were conducted to answer questions regarding what factors influence farmers’ use of extended crop rotations in intensive corn-based cropping systems and to explore whether farmers in the Corn Belt might use extended crop rotations in response to climatic changes. Findings suggest that path dependency associated with the intensive corn-based cropping system in the region limits farmers’ ability to integrate more diverse crop rotations. However, farmers in more diversified watersheds, those who farm marginal land, and those with livestock are more likely to use extended rotations. Additionally, farmers who currently use more diverse rotations are also more likely to plan to use crop rotations as a climate change adaptation strategy. If more diverse cropping systems are desired to reduce climate risks, in addition to reducing the negative impacts associated with industrial agricultural production, then further efforts must be made to facilitate more diverse crop rotations in the U.S. Corn Belt. This may be achieved by adjusting policy and economic incentives that presently discourage cropping system diversity in the region.","Marginal land,Environmental resource management,Economics,Cropping system,Cropping,Crop rotation,Climate change,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural diversification,Theoretical sampling,Symbolic interactionism,Sorting,Research questions,Qualitative research,Purpose Statement,Variables,Random effects model,Multivariate random variable,Statistics,Research questions,Psychology,Path dependency,Path dependence,Path creation,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Sociology,Social issues,Qualitative research,Psychology,Variables,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Scholarship,Negotiation,Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies),Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Land cover","Gabrielle E.

Here, eleven case studies are used to exemplify scaling-up strategies based on (1) value chains and private sector involvement, (2) information and communication technologies and agro-advisory services, and (3) policy engagement. We evaluated these case studies and the scaling strategies they exemplify, using a simple conceptual framework from the field of scaling up nutrition interventions. Results showed that these different strategies exhibit different characteristics; all offer considerable potential for taking CSA interventions to scale, but there still may be unavoidable trade-offs to consider when choosing one strategy over another, particularly between reaching large numbers of farmers and addressing farmers' specific contexts. The case studies highlighted several challenges: estimating the costs and benefits of different scaling activities, integrating knowledge across multiple levels, and addressing equity issues in scaling up. The case studies outlined here will continue to be monitored and evaluated, thus strengthening the evidence base around effective scaling-up strategies that can contribute to achieving food and nutrition security under climate change in the coming decades.","Psychological intervention,Private sector involvement,Information and Communications Technology,Food security,Equity (finance),Environmental economics,Economics,Cost–benefit analysis,Conceptual framework,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Political science,Economic growth,Sustainable innovation,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Sustainable agriculture,Soil conservation,Integrated pest management,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Good agricultural practice,Food systems,Restructuring,Remote sensing,Political science,Natural disaster,Livestock farming,Genetic resources,Transformational leadership,Stern,Politics,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Resource management,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Psychological resilience,Management by objectives,Livelihood","Olaf Westermann,Wiebke Förch,Philip K.

460,Mapping land use competition in the rural–urban fringe and future perspectives on land policies: A case study of Meknès (Morocco),2015-01-01,Land Use Policy,10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2015.01.035,"The geographical and socio-economic characteristics of peri-urban areas make them particularly vulnerable to land use competition. They are transitional zones, in continuous transformation, where various economic activities attempt to co-exist in equilibrium. Peri-urban agriculture plays a key role in this dynamic, functioning in a complex system that includes a large and diverse set of stakeholders which act to provide environmental and economic services to cities. The work described in this paper was undertaken to develop a methodology to map land use competition in terms of vulnerability to urbanization of agricultural lands, based on explicit spatial indicators set up in a GIS-based multi-criteria analysis (hereafter GIS-MCDA). The applied indicators are generated from an analysis of existing drivers of land use competition within the peri-urban area of Meknes (Morocco). This area is particularly interesting because of its agricultural characteristics, and because of recent changes in the dynamics of land use and tenure. This case study indicates a high risk of land competition in 37% of the area examined, and a very high risk in 16% of the area. The highest risk areas are located in the southern part of the peri-urban region, which is also considered the most valuable in terms of agricultural production. The map we have developed can be considered a preliminary tool for improving new planning strategies to manage land resource competition in rural–urban fringe zones. The approach presented is particularly useful as a simplified methodology to obtain spatialized indicators for the drivers of land use competition when data are limited, as often found in developing countries.","Vulnerability,Urbanization,Rural–urban fringe,Land-use planning,Land use,Land management,Environmental resource management,Economics,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Multiple-criteria decision analysis,Multicriteria decision,Management science,Water content,Single factor,Poaceae,Urban sprawl,Urban planning,Traffic congestion,Urban agriculture,Urban agglomeration,Peri-urban agriculture,Urbanization,Urban sprawl,Urban planning,Sustainability,Natural resource,Land use,Sociology,Environmental resource management,Environmental planning,Urban sprawl,Urban model,Urban form,Vulnerability,Survey data collection,Psychological resilience,Spatial analysis,Regional planning,Public participation GIS","Marta Debolini,Elodie Valette,Marie François,Jean-Pierre Chéry,Jacek Malczewski,Senthold Asseng,Ian Foster,Neil C.

At the national level, there is weak evidence of mean differences in productivity between male and female plots, but conditional on manager characteristics, plot characteristics, inputs, and crop choice, plots managed solely by a woman are consistently found less productive than all other plots. An Oaxaca-Blinder-type decomposition reveals that important factors explaining the gender differential are plot area and family labor. Women are able to obtain higher yields on smaller plots farmed with less male labor and more female labor and thus cover the gender gap in productivity at the aggregate level, but there are still significant unobservable factors which contribute to widening the gap.","Tanzania,Panel data,National level,Labour economics,Gender gap,Gender differential,Economics,Demographic economics,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural economics,Aggregate level,Wage,Statistics,Standard error,Statistics,Statistic,Quantile,Statistics,Segmented regression,Regression diagnostic,Security of tenure,Property rights,Microeconomics,Resource allocation,Pareto principle,Pareto efficiency,Wife,Unitary state,Total income,Production–possibility frontier,Frontier,Economics,Wage,Occupational segregation,Oaxaca decomposition,Wage,Oaxaca decomposition,Labour economics,Survey data collection,Observational error,Null hypothesis","Vanya Slavchevska,Ben Jann,Nicole M.

462,Assessing the ecological soundness of organic and conventional agriculture by means of life cycle assessment (LCA) - a case study of leek production,2009-01-01,British Food Journal,10.1108/00070700910992916,"Purpose – Sustainable agriculture implies the ability of agro‐ecosystems to remain productive in the long‐term. It is not easy to point out unambiguously whether or not current production systems meet this sustainability demand. A priori thinking would suggest that organic crops are environmentally favourable, but may ignore the effect of reduced productivity, which shifts the potential impact to other parts of the food provision system. The purpose of this paper is to assess the ecological sustainability of conventional and organic leek production by means of life cycle assessment (LCA). Design/methodology/approach – A cradle‐to‐farm gate LCA is applied, based on real farm data from two research centres. For a consistent comparison, two functional units (FU) were defined: 1ha and 1 kg of leek production. Findings – Assessed on an area basis, organic farming shows a more favourable environmental profile. These overall benefits are strongly reduced when the lower yields are taken into account. Related to organic farming it is therefore important that solutions are found to substantially increase the yields without increasing the environmental burden. Related to conventional farming, important potential for environmental improvements are in optimising the farm nutrient flows, reducing pesticide use and increasing its self‐supporting capacity. Research limitations/implications – The research is a cradle‐to‐farm gate LCA, future research can be expanded to comprise all phases from cradle‐to‐grave to get an idea of the total sustainability of our present food consumption patterns. The research is also limited to the case of leek production. Future research can apply the methodology to other crops. Originality/value – To date, there is still lack of clear evidence of the added value of organic farming compared to conventional farming on environmental basis. Few studies have compared organic and conventional food production by means of LCA. This paper addresses these issues.","Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Organic farming,Natural resource economics,Marketing,Life-cycle assessment,Intensive farming,Food systems,Business,Biotechnology,Agriculture,Toxicology,Pesticide resistance,Pesticide residue,Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion,Montreal Protocol,Equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine,Life cycle impact assessment,Environmental science,Environmental resource management,Statistics,Operations management,Normalization (statistics),Waste disposal,Sustainable development,Reuse,Waste management,Soil quality,Natural resource,Sustainable transport,Subsidy,Per capita,Organic milk,Organic farming,Nutrient,Waste management,Organic milk,Organic farming,Public health,Natural resource,Life-cycle assessment","Eline de Backer,Joris Aertsens,Sofie Vergucht,Walter Steurbaut,C.

To assess potential exposure of local farmers and consumers to these contaminants, pesticide use and management practices of local farmers were surveyed and residue concentrations were determined for recently used as well as for banned pesticides in water, soil, vegetables, and fish samples in two communes of Northern Vietnam. DDTs, HCHs, and Drin compounds still persist at relatively high concentrations in soil and occur in vegetable and fish samples. Recently used pesticides, such as fenobucarb, trichlorfon, cyfluthrin, and cypermethrin were detected in vegetable and fish samples.

However, little work has been done to evaluate the coupling of biogas projects to traditional agrosystems from a life-cycle perspective, which is most important in process and system optimization in different senses. By taking persimmon cultivation and processing with supports from a household biogas plant as a case study, this study conducts a life cycle assessment of coupling biogas production to agro-industry in terms of energy, environmental and economic performance. The results suggest that each production stage following the biogas/digestate utilization chain (biogas operation-persimmon cultivation-product processing) is beneficial across all three aspects. However, a tradeoff only exists in utilizing digestate as top-dressing and employing biogas utilization as engine fuel, while biogas application in fresh-keeping and digestate reuse as base fertilizer fails to increase either energy production or greenhouse gas mitigation. The coupled system can be hopefully optimized through increasing fermentation efficiency and joint operation of biogas digesters.","Waste management,Reuse,Life-cycle assessment,Greenhouse gas,Economics,Digestate,Biogas,Biofuel,Bioenergy,Agriculture,Landfill gas utilization,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas accounting,Life-cycle assessment,Iso standards,Environmental science,Waste management,Raw material,Primary energy,Water content,Raw material,Manure,Waste management,Sustainable development,Subsidy,Waste management,Renewable energy,Chlorella vulgaris,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Waste management,Fossil fuel,Environmental impact assessment,Waste management,Raw material,Methane,Waste management,Sustainable energy,Sustainable development","Bin Chen,Shaoqing Chen,K.

We provide an overview of the current knowledge on leafy vegetables with a focus on Gynandropsis gynandra, a highly nutritious species used in Africa and Asia, and highlight general and species-specific guidelines for participatory, genomics-assisted breeding of orphan crops. Key steps in genome-enabled orphan leafy vegetables improvement are identified and discussed in the context of Gynandropsis gynandra breeding, including: (1) germplasm collection and management; (2) product target definition and refinement; (3) characterization of the genetic control of key traits; (4) design of the ‘process’ for cultivar development; (5) integration of genomic data to optimize that ‘process’; (6) multi-environmental participatory testing and end-user evaluation; and (7) crop value chain development. The review discusses each step in detail, with emphasis on improving leaf yield, phytonutrient content, organoleptic quality, resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and post-harvest management. Developing the potential of neglected crops can improve food security and economic stability of impoverished farmers. Orphan crops are local, often indigenous, crop species which have been overlooked by research and underutilized as an agricultural resource. Eric Schranz of Wageningen University and his colleagues around the world have reviewed what is known about orphan leafy vegetables and provided guidelines to coordinate research into their breeding and cultivation. The guidelines include increasing awareness of orphan crop potential, collecting and characterizing wild varieties, implementing a breeding program based on modern genetics and genomics, and integrating the needs of key players throughout the process. Orphan leafy vegetables offer an excellent opportunity for small-scale farmers to feed and support themselves, but properly developing this resource requires a concerted effort from researchers, seed companies, policy-makers, farmers, and consumers.","Livelihood,Indigenous,Germplasm,Geography,Food security,Crop,Cleomaceae,Breeding program,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Plant breeding,Molecular marker,Molecular breeding,Myrosinase,Isothiocyanate,Glucotropaeolin,Throughput,New crop,High capacity,Quantitative trait locus,Plant breeding,Marker-assisted selection,Statistics,Statistical analysis,Multiplicative interaction,Whole genome sequencing,Sequence analysis,RNA-Seq,Talinum,Systematic survey,Phytochemical,Watercress,Nutrient,Nasturtium,Staple food,Plant breeding,Pennisetum,Quantitative trait locus,Plant genetics,Plant breeding","E.

For this purpose it is assumed that irrigators try to optimise personal multi-attribute utility functions via their productive decision making process (crop mix), subject to a set of constraints based upon the structural features of their farms. In this sense, farmers with homogeneous behaviour regarding water use have been grouped, such groups being established as “types” to be considered in the whole water market simulation model. This model calculates the market equilibrium through a solution that maximises aggregate welfare, which is quantified as the sum of the multi-attribute utilities reached by each of the participating agents. This methodology has been empirically applied for the Duero Basin (Northern Spain), finding that the implementation of this economic institution would increase economic efficiency and agricultural labour demand, particularly during droughts.","Welfare,Water use,Structural basin,Operations management,Mathematics,Irrigation,Economic efficiency,Decision-making,Decision support system,Agriculture,Theoretical computer science,Programming language,Modeling language,Risk management,Preference elicitation,Multicriteria classification,Stochastic simulation,Risk management,Risk aversion,Mathematics,Management science,Economic analysis,Structural equation modeling,Soil conservation,Environmental resource management,Water use,Sustainability,Opportunity cost,Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem,Subjective expected utility,Quasilinear utility,Water trading,Transaction cost,Spot contract,Robustness (computer science),Ranking,Multi criteria,Water resource management,Water pricing,Water industry","José A.

468,"Assessment of the economic impacts of heat waves: A case study of Nanjing, China",2018-01-01,Journal of Cleaner Production,10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2017.10.069,"Abstract The southeast region of China is frequently affected by summer heat waves. Nanjing, a metropolitan city in Jiangsu Province, China, experienced an extreme 14-day heat wave in 2013. Extreme heat can not only induce health outcomes in terms of excess mortality and morbidity (hospital admissions) but can also cause productivity losses for self-paced indoor workers and capacity losses for outdoor workers due to occupational safety requirements. All of these effects can be translated into productive working time losses, thus creating a need to investigate the macroeconomic implications of heat waves on production supply chains. Indeed, industrial interdependencies are important for capturing the cascading effects of initial changes in factor inputs in a single sector on the remaining sectors and the economy. To consider these effects, this paper develops an interdisciplinary approach by combining meteorological, epidemiological and economic analyses to investigate the macroeconomic impacts of heat waves on the economy of Nanjing in 2013. By adopting a supply-driven input-output (IO) model, labour is perceived to be a key factor input, and any heat effect on human beings can be viewed as a degradation of productive time and human capital. Using this interdisciplinary tool, our study shows a total economic loss of 27.49 billion Yuan for Nanjing in 2013 due to the heat wave, which is equivalent to 3.43% of the city's gross value of production in 2013. The manufacturing sector sustained 63.1% of the total economic loss at 17.34 billion Yuan. Indeed, based on the ability of the IO model to capture indirect economic loss, our results further suggest that although the productive time losses in the manufacturing and service sectors have lower magnitudes than those in the agricultural and mining sectors, they can entail substantial indirect losses because of industrial interdependencies. This important conclusion highlights the importance of incorporating industrial interdependencies and indirect economic assessments in disaster risk studies.","Working time,Supply chain,Natural resource economics,Metropolitan area,Interdependence,Human capital,Environmental resource management,Economics,Economic impact analysis,Economic growth,China,Agriculture,Survey methodology,Structural decomposition,Social accounting,Working group,Political economy of climate change,Extreme events,Social science,Natural resource,Natural disaster,Urban heat island,Psychiatry,Population,Surgery,Public health,Natural resource economics,Recent heat,Human health,Heat wave,Public health,Population,Poison control,Total cost,Statistics,Risk management,Vulnerability,Statistics,Risk management,Statistical significance,Respiratory system,Respiratory disease","Yang Xia,Yuan Li,Dabo Guan,David Mendoza Tinoco,Jiangjiang Xia,Zhongwei Yan,Jun Yang,Qiyong Liu,Hong Huo,Ronald E.

While the nutrients contained in the wastewater is considered as beneficial to agriculture, the contaminants present in it pose environmental and health risks. This paper examines the morbidity status, its determinants as well as the cost of illness for households living in the areas irrigated with wastewater in comparison with those using normal quality water. Primary data collected from six villages irrigated with wastewater along Musi River which is fed with wastewater and one control village where normal quality water is used for irrigation has been used for the analysis. It is seen that higher rates of morbidity exist in the wastewater irrigated villages when compared to the control village. Specifically, adult and female morbidity rates are significantly higher than child and male morbidity rates. From the logit analysis it is seen that exposure to wastewater and engagement in activities based on it places the households in higher risk groups to report morbidity. Small and marginal farmers incur higher economic cost of illness. However, it has been difficult to ascertain the cause and effect relationship as most of the households have reported more common illnesses like fever, head ache, skin itching, stomach ailments, etc. The study points out the need for a comprehensive risk assessment and adoption of risk management measures including setting standards for treatment and discharge of wastewater and regulations on the type of uses etc. to prevent unplanned use of untreated or partially treated wastewater while taking into account local conditions.","Water resource management,Water quality,Wastewater,Risk management,Risk assessment,Irrigation,Externality,Environmental resource management,Environmental health,Economics,Economic cost,Agriculture,Water scarcity,Water resources,Water industry,Wastewater,Soil contamination,Sludge,Wastewater,Reuse,Process improvement,Wastewater,Waste management,Greywater,Wastewater,Sludge,Sewage treatment,Zinc,Upper gastrointestinal cancer,Upper gastrointestinal,Water resources,Water quality,Wastewater,Water supply,Water resource management,Water quality,Water resources,Wastewater,Sustainability,Wastewater,Soil contamination,Soil Pollutants","Jeena T.

472,Environmental Benefits of Wireless Sensor-based Irrigation Networks: Case-study Projections and Potential Adoption Rates,2013-01-01,Horttechnology,10.21273/HORTTECH.23.6.783,"We describe and estimate the potential environmental benefits associated with the adoption of wireless sensor irrigation networks (WSIN) in United States ornamental crop production. Benefit estimates are based on results from on-farm research conducted during the previous three years, using both conservative and optimistic assumptions about the levels of WSIN technology adoption. We project reductions in water use and air and water emissions for six U.S. agricultural regions, the U.S. overall, and the six states that make up the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Based on these analyses, an average nationwide WSIN adoption rate of 50% in ornamental operations would result in annual water use savings of 223 billion liters (enough for 400,000 U.S. households annually) or a 25% reduction in total water use for all ornamental production. Reductions in annual carbon dioxide emissions, assuming only the reduced energy use from pumping less water was 36,232 Mg (equivalent to removing 7500 cars annually). Reduced fertilizer applications and more efficient irrigation resulted in reductions of 282,000 kg nitrogen and 182,000 kg phosphorous. These efficiency gains and nutrient discharge reductions have been shown to generate significant profits for growers, but would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to achieve using conventional urban or agricultural best management practices (BMPs). If WSIN technologies are adopted in other areas of specialty horticulture (e.g., fruit, vegetable, and nut production) or in agronomic crops [e.g., corn (Zea mays) and wheat (Triticum sp.)], the indirect and induced private and environmental benefits will likely be much higher. Since the environmental benefits of WSIN technologies depend critically on adoption rates, we also briefly describe potential pathways to increase WSIN adoption such as providing technical assistance or offering financing or loan guarantees.","Zea mays,Watershed,Water use,Profit (economics),Loan,Irrigation,Fertilizer,Environmental resource management,Biology,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Livelihood,Green Revolution,Food security,Social impact,Natural resource economics,Green Revolution,Variable cost,Technological change,Small farm,Poverty,Food systems,Food security,Wireless sensor network,Water content,Sustainability,Water content,Sensor system,Profitability index,Wireless sensor network,User-centered design,User feedback,Irrigation,Cost–benefit analysis,Biology,Troubleshooting,Profitability index,Irrigation efficiency,Water content,Phlox paniculata,Phlox","John C.

However, such place-related understandings of mental health and wellbeing remain largely limited to Indigenous health contexts. In this article we argue the relevance of sense of place in understanding the mental health impacts of climate change on family farmers who retain close living and working relationships to the land. We conducted a community-based qualitative case study located in the Western Australian Wheatbelt - a region that has experienced some of the most significant climate change in Australia. A three-part interview series was conducted with 22 family farmers between February 2013 and April 2014, and 15 interviews with various agricultural and mental health key informants. The research findings reveal that recently observed patterns of climate change have exacerbated farmers' worries about the weather, undermined notions of self-identity, and contributed to cumulative and chronic forms of place-based distress, culminating in heightened perceived risk of depression and suicide. The research findings highlight the tightly coupled ecosystem health-human health relationships that exist for family farmers living in regions affected by climate change, as well as the significance of farmers' place-based attachments and identities for their mental health and wellbeing.","Socioeconomics,Social psychology,Sense of place,Risk perception,Place identity,Place attachment,Mental health,Medicine,Distress,Climate change,Agriculture,Validity,Thematic map,Thematic analysis,Summit,Per capita,Nutritious food,Suicide prevention,Social psychology,Poison control,The Symbolic,Symbolic interactionism,Sustainable development,Sense of place,Public space,Public health,Transformational leadership,Stern,Politics,Sense of place,Public administration,Poison control,State government,Policy development,Indian ocean,Sociology,Social psychology,Self-perception theory,Self","Neville R.

474,Effects of social network factors on information acquisition and adoption of improved groundnut varieties: the case of Uganda and Kenya,2014-01-01,Agriculture and Human Values,10.1007/S10460-014-9486-6,"Social networks play a significant role in learning and thus in farmers’ adoption of new agricultural technologies. This study examined the effects of social network factors on information acquisition and adoption of new seed varieties among groundnut farmers in Uganda and Kenya. The data were generated through face-to-face interviews from a random sample of 461 farmers, 232 in Uganda and 229 in Kenya. To assess these effects two alternative econometric models were used: a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit (SUBP) model and a recursive bivariate probit (RBP) model. The statistical evaluation of the SUBP shows that information acquisition and adoption decisions are interrelated while tests for the RBP do not support this latter model. Therefore, the analysis is based on the results obtained from the SUBP. These results reveal that social network factors, particularly weak ties with external support (e.g., researchers, extension agents, etc.), partially influence information acquisition, but do not influence adoption. In Uganda, external support, gender, farm size, and geographic location have an impact on information acquisition. In Kenya, external support and geographic location also have an impact on information acquisition. With regard to adoption, gender, household size, and geographic location play the most important roles for Ugandan farmers, while in Kenya information from external sources, education, and farm size affect adoption choice. The study provides insight on the importance of external weak ties in groundnut farming, and a need to understand regional differences along gender lines while developing agricultural strategies. This study further illustrates the importance of farmer participation in applied technology research and the impact of social interactions among farmers and external agents.","Social network,Regional differences,Location,Interpersonal ties,Information acquisition,Environmental resource management,Economics,Econometric model,Bivariate probit,Agriculture,Sampling (statistics),Population,Panel data,Simulation methods,Programming language,Operations research,Social sustainability,Social structure,Social network,Video self-modeling,Social psychology,Social learning theory,Watershed,Soil characteristics,Social learning,Statistical analysis,Social effects,Prior information,Sociology,Sociological theory of diffusion,Product innovation,Sustainable management,Sustainability,Social capital,Tie strength,Strong ties,Strength of ties,Technical change,Profitability index,Panel data","Mary Thuo,Alexandra A.

Temporal rice area and land-use changes in Nepal were mapped using MODIS (MOD09A1) 500 m time-series data and spectral matching techniques (SMTs). This analysis presents mapped agricultural cropland change detected over a large area, where fuzzy classification accuracies range between 67% and 91% for various rice classes, with an accuracy of 82% for field-plot data. The MODIS-derived rice areas for the districts were highly correlated with national statistical data with R 2 values of 0.9918. We observed a significant decline (13%) in rice cultivated area in 2006 compared with the average over the remaining years. The higher reduction in rice area was mainly restricted to the rainfed districts of the eastern, central, and midwestern regions due to severe drought incidence, particularly in 2006. The area under the rainfed rice ecosystem continues to predominate, recording the largest share among rice classes across all the years from 2000 to 2009. The use of remote-sensing techniques is a rapid, cost-effective, and reliable measure to monitor changes in rice cultivated area over long periods of time and estimate the reduction in area cultivated due to climatic stress such as drought. Reinforced with methods and information in socioeconomics, these techniques could be used for mapping agricultural land-use changes, production planning, and targeting. Agricultural research and development institutions in Nepal can use these techniques for better planning, regular monitoring of land-use changes, and technology transfer.","Technology transfer,Spectral matching,Socioeconomic status,Production planning,Livelihood,Fuzzy classification,Ecosystem,Biology,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Synthetic aperture radar,Space-based radar,Space Shuttle,Remote sensing,Principal component analysis,Land cover change detection,Synthetic aperture radar,Space-based radar,Space Shuttle,Trajectory,Remote sensing,Image differencing,Time variations,Remote sensing,Land cover change detection,Topographic map,Space Shuttle,Shuttle Radar Topography Mission,Vegetation,Spectral bands,STREAMS,Soil science,Landscape epidemiology,Land use,Spatial variability,Spatial heterogeneity,Natural resource management,Water supply,Water scarcity,Water resources","Murali Krishna Gumma,Devendra Gauchan,Andrew Nelson,Sushil Pandey,Tom G.

Although global-scale conservation planning to achieve this target has already been attempted, conservation effectiveness strongly depends on region-specific natural and social factors, necessitating planning at the national and regional levels. We conducted complementarity analysis to achieve the target with regard to species distributions of 172 terrestrial birds in Japan, using in part the results of niche modeling, and identified candidate protected areas not currently included in existing protected areas. There was a large difference in landscape structure between existing and candidate protected areas due to the spatial bias of the existing protected areas; these areas were characterized by a high proportion of forest areas and low landscape heterogeneity, while candidate protected areas had a low proportion of forest areas and high landscape heterogeneity. As candidate areas were represented by mainly open lands, including agricultural fields, and were mixed to some degree with secondary forests, threatened species preferring agricultural fields or grasslands were well covered by candidate protected areas. Considering the extremely high cost of land in Japan and the infeasibility of strictly limiting human activities, we propose that facilitating the sustainable use of open lands is a promising approach to achieving Aichi Target 11 in Japan.","Threatened species,Sustainability,Environmental resource management,Environmental niche modelling,Ecology,Convention on Biological Diversity,Conservation planning,Complementarity (molecular biology),Biology,Biodiversity,Agriculture,Software engineering,Software analytics,Reference software,Statistics,Species distribution,Receiver operating characteristic,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Statistics,Principal component analysis,Path analysis (statistics),Species distribution,Realized niche width,Occurrence data,Sustainable forest management,Red List Index,Population,Resource management,Reserve design,Nature reserve,Training set,Selection bias,Sampling (statistics),Training set,Sampling bias,Regularization (mathematics),Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology","Shoji Naoe,Naoki Katayama,Tatsuya Amano,Munemitsu Akasaka,R Core Team,Steven J.

477,The translation of animal welfare research into practice: the case of mixing aggression between pigs,2018-01-01,Applied Animal Behaviour Science,10.1016/J.APPLANIM.2018.03.003,"Abstract Aggression between unfamiliar pigs at mixing is a major animal welfare problem in commercial farming. It has been studied since the 1970s and remains an important topic in animal welfare research. Methods to reduce pig aggression at mixing have been reviewed previously, but there has been little translation of the advocated techniques and building designs into practice. As a result, the problem persists on many commercial units. A similar situation exists for many other animal welfare issues. This article takes a new approach in not only reviewing the recent scientific literature, but also reviewing the evidence of uptake in industry. Firstly, the current state of aggression mitigation research is reviewed; including the most successful recent developments in breeding against aggression, early life socialisation, the use of pheromones and nutrition. Secondly, information is extracted from both peer reviewed and industry literature to establish the extent to which these strategies have been transferred from research to practice. Finally, we discuss why in spite of the amount of research on reducing aggression at mixing the problem has not reduced in intensive farming systems. The limited uptake in practice appears to be due to low prioritisation of the problem, the practicalities of implementation, lack of information on cost-effectiveness and ineffective communication of research to the farming community. To bridge this gap, industry must be involved in the design of practical solutions and the cost-effectiveness of these must be quantified. This approach should also be considered for other animal welfare issues under investigation. We recommend a better alignment between research questions and industry interests to increase the success of research efforts to improve animal welfare in practice.","Spite,Socialization,Social psychology,Scientific literature,Public economics,Psychology,Intensive farming,Building design,Animal welfare,Agriculture,Aggression,Surgery,Structured interview,Public health,Reimbursement,Public health,Program evaluation,Sustainable agriculture,Livestock,European union,Skin temperature,Respiration,Rectal temperature,Skin lesion,Psychology,Physiology,Veterinary medicine,Theory of planned behavior,Social psychology,Trait,Rate of evolution,Quantitative genetics,Welfare,Space requirements,Internal medicine,Welfare,Veterinary medicine,Stunning,Social psychology,Point of sale,Marketing","Rachel S.E.

478,Environmental evaluation of high-value agricultural produce with diverse water sources: case study from Southern California,2018-01-01,Environmental Research Letters,10.1088/1748-9326/AAA49A,"Meeting agricultural demand in the face of a changing climate will be one of the major challenges of the 21st century. California is the single largest agricultural producer in the United States but is prone to extreme hydrologic events, including multi-year droughts. Ventura County is one of California's most productive growing regions but faces water shortages and deteriorating water quality. The future of California's agriculture is dependent on our ability to identify and implement alternative irrigation water sources and technologies. Two such alternative water sources are recycled and desalinated water. The proximity of high-value crops in Ventura County to both dense population centers and the Pacific Ocean makes it a prime candidate for alternative water sources. This study uses highly localized spatial and temporal data to assess life-cycle energy use, life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, operational costs, applied water demand, and on-farm labor requirements for four high-value crops. A complete switch from conventional irrigation with groundwater and surface water to recycled water would increase the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with strawberry, lemon, celery, and avocado production by approximately 14%, 7%, 59%, and 9%, respectively. Switching from groundwater and surface water to desalinated water would increase life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 33%, 210%, 140%, and 270%, respectively. The use of recycled or desalinated water for irrigation is most financially tenable for strawberries due to their relatively high value and close proximity to water treatment facilities. However, changing strawberry packaging has a greater potential impact on life-cycle energy use and greenhouse gas emissions than switching the water source. While this analysis does not consider the impact of water quality on crop yields, previous studies suggest that switching to recycled water could result in significant yield increases due to its lower salinity.","Water treatment,Water quality,Surface water,Population,Irrigation,Groundwater,Greenhouse gas,Environmental engineering,Economics,Atmospheric sciences,Agriculture,Water use,Water pollution,Water balance,Water use,Water supply,Water scarcity,Water scarcity,Water resources,Water cycle,Waste management,Soy milk,Ruminant livestock,Water supply,Solar energy,Seawater,Population,Operations management,Greenhouse gas,Geography,Climatology,Climate change,Saltwater intrusion,Saline water,Intrusion,Water transport,Water supply,Water resource management,Water pollution,Waste management,Petroleum","Eric M Bell,Jennifer R Stokes-Draut,Arpad Horvath,Mesfin Mergia Mekonnen,Arjen Y.

In particular, it examines the evolution of the raspberry export sector in the context of Chile's non-traditional agricultural export boom, and considers its importance to smallholder growers and rural households in central Chile. The paper first outlines the geography and structural configuration of the global value chain for Chilean raspberries, and considers modes of governance and forms of coordination between key actors within the chain. Second, the terms and implications of smallholder grower participation in the value chain are explored in a discussion of access to key livelihoods assets. The paper concludes that institutional support to smallholders, even in the case of a crop that is widely seen to have a small-scale ‘size bias', remains integral to their capacity to comply with required safety and quality standards and gain and retain market access via the value chain.","Value chain,Natural resource economics,Market economy,Market access,Livelihood,Globalization,Global value chain,Economics,Development economics,Corporate governance,Boom,Agriculture,Transaction cost,Rational choice institutionalism,Path dependence,Subsistence agriculture,Rural management,Rural economics,Engineering management,Economics,Rapid rise,Procurement,Latin Americans,Sustainable livelihood,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Rural sociology,Sustainability,Rural development,Politics,Standard of living,Poverty,Portfolio,Stylized fact,Sociology,Social change,Sustainability,Socioeconomics,Social capital,Sustainable development,Rural sociology,Rural economics","Edward R.T.

It then uses genetic or pedigree information to partition the total benefits between these two countries and IRRI. Finally, the study uses reported elasticity of poverty reduction with respect to agricultural output growth to assess the effects of national and international research on poverty reduction in rural India and China. The results indicate that rice varietal improvement research has contributed tremendously to increase in rice production, accounting for 14-23 percent of total production value over the last two decades in both countries. Rice research has also helped reduce large numbers of rural poor. IRRI played a crucial role in these successes. In 1999, for every $1 million invested at IRRI, more than 800 and 15,000 rural poor were lifted above the poverty line in China and India, respectively. These poverty-reduction effects were even larger in the earlier years.""

We show that information on location and start data of large farms, combined with existing smallholder farm surveys, allows to complement this with a difference-in-difference approach to systematically assess spillovers from large farm establishment. Illustrative application to Mozambique suggests positive short-term effects from newly established large farms on adoption of agricultural practices and input use by small farms less than 50km from newly established large operations. Robustness checks for crop farms only also suggest job creation in the proximity of newly established crop, but not livestock farms. Yet, large farm establishment decreased perceived well-being within a 25-km band and, in the time horizon considered here, did not lead to better access to output markets, cultivation of larger areas or, once other factors are controlled for, higher yields. This allows us to reject the notion of negative spillovers from large farm establishment but casts doubt on the wisdom of large unconditional subsidies to attract investors. In addition to drawing policy conclusions for Mozambique, we highlight the methodology’s wider applicability and scope for expansion.","Time horizon,Subsidy,Spillover effect,Socioeconomics,Natural resource economics,Livestock,Land based,Economics,Economic growth,Commodity,Boom,Agriculture,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Rural poverty,Romer,Panel data,Microeconomics,Preliminary analysis,Politics,Natural resource economics,Water supply,Water resources,Water resource management,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Socioeconomics,Rural area,Population,Plant level,Microeconomics,Strategic positioning,Speculation,Phenomenon,Variable cost,Price elasticity of supply,Microeconomics,Rural area,Nonfarm payrolls,Job creation,Principle of legality,Political economy,Land tenure","Klaus Deininger,Fang Xia,Klaus Deininger,Derek Byerlee,Jonathan Lindsay,Andrew Norton,Harris Selod,J.

Agricultural lands, which serves as the main source of livelihood, has been encroached by the process. This paper seeks to assess the impact of rapid urbanisation on agricultural lands in developing cities, drawing empirical evidence from Tamale, Ghana. The research used a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods including interviews and questionnaires to collect and analyse data from stakeholders in selected peri urban areas in the Tamale city region. Contrary to the mainstream view that the polygamous nature of Northern region is the main source of increment in the population and thus urbanisation in the area, stakeholders’ perception was different as responses indicated that the rapid urbanisation of Tamale is as a result of increased commercial activities and its strategic location. The rapid urbanisation of Tamale sparked up a succession syndrome where prime agricultural lands have been converted to other land uses believed to be the highest and best use. The pressures of urbanisation have negative implications on predominantly poor farming communities in the Tamale region. Policy focus should be geared towards the protection of prime agricultural lands that serves as main sources of livelihood. Urbanisation is necessary but not to the extent of denying the rural folks of their main source of livelihood.","Urbanization,Socioeconomics,Population,Livelihood,Land use,Highest and best use,Geography,Developing country,City region,Agriculture,Strengths and weaknesses,Natural resource economics,Greenhouse effect,Socioeconomics,Economics,Economic growth,Statistics,Random variable,Normal distribution,World economy,Water scarcity,Urbanization,Urbanization,Socioeconomics,Livelihood,Social network,Livelihood security,Livelihood,Urbanization,Sustainability,Priority areas,Urbanization,Urban land,Residential land,Sustainable development,Land use,Land tenure,Socioeconomics,Geography,Economic growth","Francis Zana Naab,Romanus Dogkubong Dinye,Raphael Kasim Kasanga,Josef Schmidhuber,Francesco N.

However, most present knowledge on the impact of agroforestry systems on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage comes from tropical systems. This study was conducted in southern France, in an 18-year-old agroforestry plot, where hybrid walnuts ( Juglans regia × nigra L.) are intercropped with durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum ), and in an adjacent agricultural control plot, where durum wheat is the sole crop. We quantified SOC stocks to 2.0 m depth and their spatial variability in relation to the distance to the trees and to the tree rows. The distribution of additional SOC storage in different soil particle-size fractions was also characterized. SOC accumulation rates between the agroforestry and the agricultural plots were 248 ± 31 kg C ha − 1  yr − 1 for an equivalent soil mass (ESM) of 4000 Mg ha − 1 (to 26–29 cm depth) and 350 ± 41 kg C ha − 1  yr − 1 for an ESM of 15,700 Mg ha − 1 (to 93–98 cm depth). SOC stocks were higher in the tree rows where herbaceous vegetation grew and where the soil was not tilled, but no effect of the distance to the trees (0 to 10 m) on SOC stocks was observed. Most of the additional SOC storage was found in coarse organic fractions (50–200 and 200–2000 μm), which may be rather labile fractions. All together our study demonstrated the potential of alley cropping agroforestry systems under Mediterranean conditions to store SOC, and questioned the stability of this storage.","Vegetation,Spatial variability,Soil science,Soil map,Soil carbon,Mediterranean climate,Geology,Biomass,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecosystem,Agriculture,Software engineering,Software analytics,Reference software,Nonlinear system,Nonlinear mixed effects model,Mixed effects,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Statistics,Statistical model,Statistical hypothesis testing,World Reference Base for Soil Resources,Unified Soil Classification System,USDA soil taxonomy,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Soil fertility,Statistics,Statistical model,Statistical hypothesis testing,Variogram,Stochastic simulation,Statistics,Tillage,Soil water,Soil science,Vegetation type,Vegetation,Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands","Rémi Cardinael,Tiphaine Chevallier,Bernard G.

This has led to the emergence of certified products meeting sustainability criteria. Because consumers are willing to pay a price premium for sustainably produced commodities, these certifications act as market-based instruments to promote sustainable land use. Among Geographical Indications (GIs) labels, the two European Union GIs – called Protection of Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protection of Geographical Indication (PGI) – can be considered as agricultural product certification. These GIs identify a good as originating from a region where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is attributable to its geographical origin. Land use is potentially affected by GIs because product characteristics are associated with the biophysical attributes of the terroir and some product specifications relate to land management practices. Little empirical evidence substantiates the claim that GIs have an impact on land use. The objective of this study was to understand whether Geographical Indications are an effective market-based instrument to promote conservation of extensive land use practices in marginal mountain areas. We conducted farm surveys along a gradient of GI requirements for the following similar cheese products: Tomme de Savoie PGI, Tomme de Savoie EQC, and Tome des Bauges PDO. We tested the hypothesis that the more stringent PDO requirements were associated with more extensive agricultural practices and provided more benefits to farmers. Results showed that the strict standards of PGI and PDO are associated with greater benefits for farmers and more extensive agricultural practices. In comparison to PGI farmers, PDO farmers obtain higher price premiums and gain more knowledge. More extensive practices are observed on PDO farms but the differences between labels are minor. Our results also reveal a great variability in agricultural practices among farms of a same label. Farmers have various motivations for labelling their product.","Terroir,Sustainability,Product certification,Price premium,Land use,Land management,European union,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Economics,Agriculture,Social science,Short food supply chains,Rural development,Natural resource economics,Land use,European union,Typology,Three level,Supply chain,Traceability,Marketing,Food safety,Terroir,Sociology,Scrutiny,Sustainable management,Spatial ecology,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Regional science,Good agricultural practice,Vulnerability,Sustainability science,Sustainability organizations,Public policy,Payment,Land use,Tourism,Sustainability,Goods and services","Pénélope Lamarque,Eric F.

Derived crop maps can serve as a baseline for yield or area estimation or to target next year's census. For subsistence farming, where small parcels are mixed with other land use, crop mapping remains very challenging. This article evaluates the potential of discriminating crops in West Shewa, an area with small-scale farming in central Ethiopia. A hard classification of high-resolution 30 m images, yielding good results for commercial farming, could not deal with mixed pixels due to the small parcels. Very high resolution 4 m images have a more appropriate pixel size, although they only cover subsets of the region. The very high resolution classification was used to calibrate a neural network for sub-pixel classification of the high resolution images.

506,Impact of small dams on agriculture and groundwater development: A case study from Pakistan,2007-01-01,Agricultural Water Management,10.1016/J.AGWAT.2007.05.007,"Abstract Water resources development and management is imperative for sustainable agriculture in water scarce areas. In Pakistan, the state of Punjab has constructed 32 small dams, in the Pothwar region, to store and conserve water for agricultural production. However, little information is available on the impact of these small dams on agriculture and socio-economic conditions of the area. This study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of three small dams, Jawa, Kasala and Dhok Sanday Mar, on agriculture and groundwater development in the area and to provide guidelines for the effective utilization and sustainable management of small dams in Pakistan. Data related to on-farm practices were collected during personal interviews using a pre-tested questionnaire. Water-table depth was measured from the open wells in the area with a water-table recorder. Secondary data such as inflow, outflow, rainfall, water charges and land use were collected from small dams organization. After the construction of these dams and irrigation canals, cropping intensity and crop yield have increased. Due to availability of irrigation water there has been a shift of cropping pattern from wheat and forage crops to vegetable crops. Farmers are earning up to $2433 per ha per year. An analysis of inflow–outflow of the dams shows that, if properly managed, the storage is sufficient to irrigate all the crop lands within the command area. The depth to the water table has also decreased since the dams were constructed. The water table varies from 6 to 15 m in the irrigated areas served by the Khasala dam as compared to 7–39 m before the dam was constructed. The water table depths for the areas served by the Jawa dam ranged from 7 to 39 m before the dam was constructed to 9–25 m after construction. The shallower water table has made the groundwater accessible and as a result the number of wells has increased. This has reduced drudgery on the local inhabitants particularly for women who had to fetch water from far away for their domestic uses.

507,"Factors that influence pig production in Central Uganda - case study of Nangabo Sub-County, Wakiso district.",2011-01-01,Veterinary World,10.5455/VETWORLD.2012.346-351,"Aim: To study the factors affecting pig production in Nangabo Sub-County, Wakiso District, Central Uganda. Materials and Methods: A total of 11% (1350/12783) of all households in the Nangabo Sub-County kept pigs. The th systematic sampling technique was used to complete the list of all pig farming households. This was done by taking 10 farming household until 10% of all the farming households were sampled. A total of 135 farmers were interviewed with semistructured questionnaire. Questionnaire data was entered into Microsoft Excel worksheet and trans-ferred into Statistical Package for Social Scientists Results: Results indicated that 49.6 % of the pigs were raised in the semi-intensive system while 31%, 12% and 8% of the farmers kept pigs on intensive, tethering and free range rearing systems respectively. Farmers that raised their pigs on what is hereby referred to as semi-intensive and intensive management systems allowed their pigs up to five and two hours of open foraging respectively. Ninety eight percent of the farmers provided housing to their pigs and the commonest pig houses were local mud houses and a few of them were tree shades. Majority of farmers (85.2%) watered their pigs at least once a day. The major factors limiting pig production were; diseases and parasites mainly helminthosis and African swine fever (ASF). Others included; high costs of inputs, lack of capital, unstable availability of feed resources, inadequate advisory services and feed price fluctuation (maize bran, sow and weaner), lack of good quality breeding stock, poor and unorganized marketing, lack of enough land, high costs of veterinary medicines and inability to keep records. Additionally, lack of enough water and uncontrolled pig movement grossly limited the pig production in Wakiso district. Most Ugandans keep their pigs in periurban areas of Uganda. It was however, noted that there were important limitations for pig production in the country. To improve pig production and reduce animal protein deficit, knowledge on constraints to pig production was important to inform pig sector promotion stakeholders. Conclusion: Limitations to pig farming including parasites and diseases, ASF, nutritional deficiencies, high cost of inputs like building materials, drugs and veterinary services, inadequate capital and failure of farmers to access credit services, expensive feeds among others were identified and should be addressed to meet national animal protein requirements.","Veterinary medicine,Systematic sampling,Price fluctuation,Pig farming,Malnutrition,Limiting,Intensive management,Biology,Agriculture,African swine fever,Surgery,Medicine,Incremental growth,Red meat intake,Red meat,Processed meat","Dennis Muhanguzi,Vincent Lutwama,Frank Norbert Mwiine,Mercedes de Onis,Adelheid W Onyango,C.

508,"Reclaiming localisation for revitalising agriculture: A case study of peri-urban agricultural change in Gothenburg, Sweden",2016-01-01,Journal of Rural Studies,10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2016.07.013,"Agriculture near urban landscapes has recently been re-appreciated with the recognition of its economic, social and environmental contributions. However, rapid urbanisation and global agricultural restructuring constituting complex processes across multiple scales tend to threaten the survival of peri-urban agriculture. Focusing on family farms near Gothenburg in Sweden, this paper intends to explore the relations between location and agriculture and how family farms have been able to continue farming in peri-urban areas. Unlike previous studies of peri-urban agriculture, mostly carried out by planners from an urban-centric perspective, this paper deploys a rural and place-based perspective by drawing on theories of agricultural location. Based on statistical and spatial analyses of land use change, and interviews with farmers and authorities, the processes and drivers of local agricultural change are analysed. The results identify four simultaneous processes that produce the diversity in forms of agriculture between farms: structural changes, loss of farmland to urban expansion, specialisation of on-farm activities and a niching trend of on-farm activities. The new findings which shed light on the theory of agricultural localisation are: 1) niche production greatly takes advantage of the peri-urban location; 2) a reverse von Thunen's transportation pattern is enabled by the proximity to urban consumers; 3) enhancing competitive advantage through saving labour costs is enabled by the direct relation to consumers at the peri-urban location; 4) multifunctional agriculture has potential but also raises conflicts between different types of land use in peri-urban areas; 5) a secured access to land for farmers enabled by the local governance which separates the increasing land value from land rent is fundamental for supporting continued peri-urban agriculture. Our recommendation is that policy makers need to shift to a location-sensitive governing praxis of agriculture in order to re-vitalise peri-urban areas.","Urbanization,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Peri-urban agriculture,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Land tenure,Environmental resource management,Environmental planning,Economy,Economics,Competitive advantage,Agriculture,Natural resource economics,Land use,European union,Sociology,Social science,Realm,Supply chain,Short food supply chains,Neoclassical economics,Transformation processes,Sustainability science,Sustainability,Sociology,Social science,Rural area,Path dependency,Operations management,Normative,Sociology,Environmental resource management,Environmental planning,Urban planning,Urban ecosystem,Urban density,Natural science,Geography,Economic system,Urbanization,Temporal scales,Sustainable development","Anders Wästfelt,Qian Zhang,D.

509,New uses for old traditional farm buildings: The case of the underground wine cellars in Spain,2010-01-01,Land Use Policy,10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2009.10.002,"Abstract Traditional buildings are important features of the rural landscape and a valuable documental source about rural technology and ways of life in the countryside. For the last 60 years many traditional farm buildings have lost their original function because of the great changes in the European agricultural sector. Their respectful conversion to adopt new activities provides economic, socio-cultural and landscape benefits for promoters and the whole rural community. Traditional wine caves used for the production and storage of wine are particular good examples of redundant rural buildings needing for viable new uses. The aims of this paper are to present the architectural features of these agro-industrial spaces and to discuss suitable new uses for them. The technical, socioeconomic and legal contexts of the reuse are also examined in the paper. The use of traditional wine cellars in the production of high-quality artisanal wines, cheeses and cured meats, for cultural activities, as restaurants, or in the production of mushrooms, among others, are viable reuse proposals according to the current needs in the Mediterranean rural areas. Nevertheless, special care must be taken when restoring these spaces in order to respect the identity and the aesthetic appeal of the ancient cellars and not to come into conflict with the planning and building regulations.","Wine,Socioeconomic status,Rural area,Reuse,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Economics,Cultural heritage,Cultural activities,Appeal,Agriculture,Sustainability,Survival strategy,Survival of the fittest,Wine industry,Wine,Tourism,Tourism,Rural tourism,Rural history,Tourism geography,Tourism,Socioeconomics,Vernacular architecture,Vernacular,Rural area,Sustainable development,Landscape planning,Landscape history,Wine,Tourism,Geography,Variables,Standard deviation,Negative association,Study planning,Site selection,Rural area,Geography","J.M.

510,A Case for Crop Wild Relative Preservation and Use in Potato,2013-01-01,Crop Science,10.2135/CROPSCI2012.11.0627,"ABSTRACT Crop wild relatives (CWr) offer a critical resource to address food security needs by pro -viding genetic diversity for crop improvement, leading to increased plasticity and productiv-ity of farming systems. However, plant breed-ers typically have not developed systematic or comprehensive strategies for the characteriza-tion and use of CWr for cultivar improvement. potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) provides an excellent case study for the use of CWr germ-plasm in addressing global food security needs. International cooperation and collaboration are critical to collect, characterize, and use CWr in anticipation of future production needs. Both ex situ and in situ preservation of wild potato spe-cies are essential to assure a comprehensive conservation plan. Top priorities include a coor -dinated inventory of gene bank holdings fol-lowed by re-collection of CWr and new collec-tion where gaps exist. Access to CWr genetic diversity will continue to be critical as breeders face the challenge of developing cultivars that fit into new production systems, especially in response to climate change. With the advent of the genomics era, new visions of germplasm use strategies are emerging. In addition to fill-ing gaps in collections, it will be important to expand efforts to characterize and use potato CWr. A systematic and integrated strategy is needed to evaluate CW r in gene banks for traits to continue breeding progress.S.H.

In order to comply with the environmentally responsible market requests the measurement of the greenhouse gas emissions of Ecuadorian agricultural goods has been promoted employing the carbon footprint concept. Ecuador is the largest exporter of bananas in the world. Within this context, this study is a first assessment of the carbon footprint of the Ecuadorian premium export banana ( Musa AAA) using a considerable amount of field data. The system boundaries considered from agricultural production to delivery in a European destination port. The data collected over three years permitted identifying the hot spot stages. For the calculation, the CCaLC V3.0 software developed by the University of Manchester is used. The carbon footprint of the Ecuadorian export banana ranged from 0.45 to 1.04 kg CO 2 -equivalent/kg banana depending on the international overseas transport employed. The principal contributors to the carbon footprint are the on farm production and overseas transport stages. Mitigation and reduction strategies were suggested for the main emission sources in order to achieve sustainable banana production.","Supply chain,Life-cycle assessment,Greenhouse gas,Field data,Environmental impact assessment,Environmental engineering,Engineering,Carbon footprint,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Life-cycle assessment,Greenhouse,Food processing,Greenhouse gas,Environmental science,Agricultural economics,Water use,Natural resource economics,Management practices,Waste management,Value chain,Supply chain,Waste management,Scenario analysis,Plant production,Marketing,Market share,Government,Environmental science,Environmental engineering,Carbon footprint,Life-cycle assessment,Greenhouse gas,Ethanol fuel,Geography,Forestry,Carbon footprint,Humanities,Geography,Cartography","Alfredo Iriarte,Maria Gabriela Almeida,Pablo Villalobos,Franziska Stoessel,Ronnie Juraske,Stephan Pfister,Stefanie Hellweg,Imo,Wesley W.

512,The use of remotely sensed rainfall for managing drought risk: A case study of weather index insurance in Zambia,2016-01-01,Remote Sensing,10.3390/RS8040342,"Remotely sensed rainfall is increasingly being used to manage climate-related risk in gauge sparse regions. Applications based on such data must make maximal use of the skill of the methodology in order to avoid doing harm by providing misleading information. This is especially challenging in regions, such as Africa, which lack gauge data for validation. In this study, we show how calibrated ensembles of equally likely rainfall can be used to infer uncertainty in remotely sensed rainfall estimates, and subsequently in assessment of drought. We illustrate the methodology through a case study of weather index insurance (WII) in Zambia. Unlike traditional insurance, which compensates proven agricultural losses, WII pays out in the event that a weather index is breached. As remotely sensed rainfall is used to extend WII schemes to large numbers of farmers, it is crucial to ensure that the indices being insured are skillful representations of local environmental conditions. In our study we drive a land surface model with rainfall ensembles, in order to demonstrate how aggregation of rainfall estimates in space and time results in a clearer link with soil moisture, and hence a truer representation of agricultural drought. Although our study focuses on agricultural insurance, the methodological principles for application design are widely applicable in Africa and elsewhere.","Weather index,Remote sensing,Precipitation,Meteorology,Harm,Geology,Drought risk,Agriculture","Emily Black,Elena Tarnavsky,Ross Maidment,Helen Greatrex,Agrotosh Mookerjee,Tristan Quaife,Matthew Brown,Sonia I.

The model is tested with the data of several types of agricultural commodities and error analysis is made. The result shows that the mixed model is more accurate in forecasting agricultural commodity prices than each single model does, and has better accuracy in warning values.

This case study considers the Bago River Basin in Myanmar, which is frequently damaged by flooding. A survey was conducted to determine the economic damage to affected populations and properties during a large flood in 2011. House damage, in-house damage, and income loss function models were established for residential areas, along with an agricultural damage function model. Flood water height, floor height from the ground, occurrence of landslide erosion and types of building materials could aggravate house damage, whereas in-house damage is exacerbated by flood water height above plinth level and types of house's plinth level. Income loss scales with flood duration, job category and household level. Flood water height, flood duration and the growth stage of paddies worsen agricultural damage. Knowing the relationship between flooding and its damaging factors, these models can be easily applied to a flood loss estimation model in further research.","Plinth,Landslide,Land use,Hydrology,Flooding (psychology),Flood myth,Erosion,Environmental science,Drainage basin,Agriculture,Risk analysis (engineering),Risk analysis (business),Operations research,Test statistic,Statistical power,Statistical hypothesis testing,Water cycle,Mathematical model,Hydrology,Hydrology,Flood myth,Flood loss,Storm surge,Geology,Cyclone Nargis,Wine,Statistical hypothesis testing,Model testing,River flood,Hydrology,Geology,Sustainable development,Sociology of scientific knowledge,Research data,Risk management,Precipitation,Natural disaster,Water utility,Water industry,Risk screening","Shelly Win,Win Win Zin,Akiyuki Kawasaki,Zin Mar Lar Tin San,B.

517,"Investigating Cross‐Sectoral Synergies through Integrated Aquaculture, Fisheries, and Agriculture Phosphorus Assessments: A Case Study of Norway",2016-01-01,Journal of Industrial Ecology,10.1111/JIEC.12324,"Future phosphorus (P) scarcity and eutrophication risks demonstrate the need for systems‐wide P assessments. Despite the projected drastic increase in world‐wide fish production, P studies have yet to include the aquaculture and fisheries sectors, thus eliminating the possibility of assessing their relative importance and identifying opportunities for recycling. Using Norway as a case, this study presents the results of a current‐status integrated fisheries, aquaculture, and agriculture P flow analysis and identifies current sectoral linkages as well as potential cross‐sectoral synergies where P use can be optimized. A scenario was developed to shed light on how the projected 2050 fivefold Norwegian aquaculture growth will likely affect P demand and secondary P resources. The results indicate that, contrary to most other countries where agriculture dominates, in Norway, aquaculture and agriculture drive P consumption and losses at similar levels and secondary P recycling, both intra‐ and cross‐sectorally, is far from optimized. The scenario results suggest that the projected aquaculture growth will make the Norwegian aquaculture sector approximately 4 times as P intensive as compared to agriculture, in terms of both imported P and losses. This will create not only future environmental challenges, but also opportunities for cross‐sectoral P recycling that could help alleviate the mineral P demands of agriculture. Near‐term policy measures should focus on utilizing domestic fish scrap for animal husbandry and/or fish feed production. Long‐term efforts should focus on improving technology and environmental systems analysis methods to enable P recovery from aquaculture production and manure distribution in animal husbandry. ","Scarcity,Industrial ecology,Fishery,Fish farming,Eutrophication,Environmental resource management,Economics,Commercial fish feed,Aquaculture,Animal husbandry,Agriculture,Scarcity,Phosphorus,Phosphorite,Wastewater,Waste management,Sustainability,Sustainability,Organic aquaculture,Offshore aquaculture,Stocking,Nutrient,Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture,Recirculating aquaculture system,Pollution,Nitrification,Supply and demand,Steelmaking,Phosphorus,Wastewater,Waste treatment,Sewage treatment,Nutrient,Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture,Fishery,Nutrient management,Nutrient cycle,Nutrient,Settling,Nutrient,Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture","Helen A.

Socio-economic and technical data were obtained from 1,171 cocoa farmers and 1,638 cocoa plantations to assess the long-term dynamics of cocoa agroforests in central Cameroon since the beginning of the twentieth century. On-site, we estimated the age of the cocoa trees and measured their density in a sub-sample of 402 cocoa plantations. We inventoried associated woody species in 45 cocoa plantations from this sub-sample. Our results revealed a high Shannon index for the cocoa plantations (2.6) and showed that an average of 25 tree species per cocoa plantation had been planted with the cocoa trees at a density of 120 trees ha−1. Surveys indicated that there had been no mineral fertilization. Nearly 70% of the cocoa agroforests were over 40 years old, and all farmers continuously regenerated their cocoa tree stands. Irrespective of the cocoa plantation age, the cocoa tree density remained over 1,000 plants ha−1, and fermented dried cocoa yields were 255 kg ha−1 on average. Cocoa agroforests occupied 60% of the cultivated area on farms and cocoa sales accounted for 75% of total farm income. Almost a third of the farmers were from the area and under 40 years old. In conclusion, our results show that the farmers’ agroforestry practices, in addition to the fact that the cocoa tree stands were continuously regenerated and passed down between generations of farmers, could explain the long-term dynamics of cocoa agroforests in central Cameroon.","Tropics,Sterculiaceae,Farm income,Diversity index,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecosystem,Agriculture,Agricultural biodiversity,Tropics,Resource management,Landscape ecology,Theobroma,Silviculture,Shade tree,Species diversity,Population size,Population,Tree species,Resource use,Population density,Weed control,Tropical agriculture,Pest control,Theobroma,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Tropics,Tropical deforestation,Sustainability,Tree inventory,Standard of living,Market access,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Woody plant,Spatial distribution,Shade tree","Patrick Jagoret,Isabelle Michel-Dounias,Eric Malézieux,G.

But when the bulk of population is illiterate and inaccessible to modern means of communication, the challenge is all the more difficult. In this situation mass media like radio can play a significant role in disseminating information. Radio is a very popular and powerful communication medium and has proved very effective in helping to disseminate agricultural information. One of the special features of All India Radio is its 'farm and home units', which are engaged in disseminating scientific information about farming to needy people living mostly in poorly accessible villages. There are number of sources of agricultural information which a farmer can use. In order to find out how the farmers rate radio broadcast in respect of the credibility of the information as compared to other sources. The radio programme of AIR Dharwad has been taken to investigate the credibility issue. The respondents for this study were selected from three districts of Karnataka. From Dharwad-88 farmers; Gadag86 farmers and Bijapur-86 farmers were selected randomly. Finally 260 farmers were selected for the study. The primary data was collected through structured questionnaire. The results indicate that the farm radio programmes are the second credible, next to agriculture extension workers. This might be due to the fact that extension worker is very much available in the village and gives the information in required format. It is obvious that the Farm and Home units programmes should be more effective, to achieve high credibility. Further, content of the farm radio programmes, which once broadcasted should be made available in print form and possibly in audio form as well in all the Raita Salaha Kendras (Advice Centre for Farmers) for reference by the farmers.","Radio broadcasting,Population,Mass media,Marketing,Environmental resource management,Dissemination,Credibility,Communication channel,Business,Agriculture,Agricultural information,Sampling (statistics),Research questions,Research design,Socioeconomic status,Public relations,Political science","Iosr Journals,Onkargouda Kakade,Umunna Nnaemeka Opara,B.

521,Using LCA to evaluate impacts and resources conservation potential of composting : A case study of the Asti District in Italy,2008-01-01,Resources Conservation and Recycling,10.1016/J.RESCONREC.2008.08.002,"Separate collection of municipal solid waste has overcome the 50% threshold in the Asti District in northern Italy, nearly one-third being composed of household and green organic waste. In order to address present and future solutions, it becomes therefore fundamental to assess the environmental performances of the current management of organic waste from separate collection. A from-gate-to-cradle life cycle assessment (LCA) model has been developed by expanding system boundaries, in order to carry out the assessment in the context of the whole waste management streamline. The environmental performances of an existing aerobic plant were made available, based on field measured data, by paying attention to the role and contribution of waste management subsystems. The need for actual and reliable data on materials and energy input, as well as gross and net gains from materials recovery, including benefits arising from use of compost in farming activities, was probably the major drawback that had to be faced. The study integrated the findings of different investigations from the literature with field measured data in order to obtain a more comprehensive framework representative of the area under study. The results may help public administrators to better understand the suitability of using LCA tools when dealing with solid waste management strategies.","Waste treatment,Waste management,Northern italy,Municipal solid waste,Life-cycle assessment,Environmental engineering,Engineering,Drawback,Compost,Biodegradable waste,Agriculture,Landfill gas utilization,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas accounting,Product system,Operations research,Life-cycle assessment,Life cycle impact assessment,Environmental science,Environmental resource management,Life-cycle assessment,Life cycle impact assessment,Environmental resource management,Life-cycle assessment,Inventory analysis,Impact assessment,restrict,Waste management system,Waste management,Waste management,Solid waste management,Risk analysis (engineering),Waste treatment,Waste management,Time horizon,Waste treatment,Waste management system,Waste management,Weighting,Waste management,Sustainable waste management","Giovanni Andrea Blengini,K.

522,Yield-scaled mitigation of ammonia emission from N fertilization: the Spanish case,2014-01-01,Environmental Research Letters,10.1088/1748-9326/9/12/125005,"Synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer and field application of livestock manure are the major sources of ammonia (NH3) volatilization. This N loss may decrease crop productivity and subsequent deposition promotes environmental problems associated with soil acidification and eutrophication. Mitigation measures may have associated side effects such as decreased crop productivity (e.g. if N fertilizer application is reduced), or the release of other reactive N compounds (e.g. N2O emissions if manure is incorporated). Here, we present a novel methodology to provide an integrated assessment of the best strategies to abate NH3 from N applications to crops. Using scenario analyses, we assessed the potential of 11 mitigation measures to reduce NH3 volatilization while accounting for their side effects on crop productivity, N use efficiency (NUE) and N surplus (used as an indicator of potential N losses by denitrification/nitrification and NO3− leaching/run-off). Spain, including its 48 provinces, was selected as a case study as it is the third major producer of agricultural goods in Europe, and also the European country with the highest increase in NH3 emissions from 1990 to 2011. Mitigation scenarios comprised of individual measures and combinations of strategies were evaluated at a country- and regional level. Compared to the reference situation of standard practices for the year 2008, implementation of the most effective region-specific mitigation strategy led to 63% NH3 mitigation at the country level. Implementation of a single strategy for all regions reduced NH3 by 57% at the highest. Strategies that involved combining mitigation measures produced the largest NH3 abatement in all cases, with an 80% reduction in some regions. Among the strategies analyzed, only suppression of urea application combined with manure incorporation and incorporation of N synthetic fertilizers other than urea showed a fully beneficial situation: yield-scaled NH3 emissions were reduced by 82%, N surplus was reduced by 9%, NUE was increased by 19% and yield was around 98% that of the reference situation. This study shows that the adoption of viable measures may provide an opportunity for countries like Spain to meet the international agreements on NH3 mitigation, while maintaining crop yields and increasing NUE.","Soil acidification,Nitrification,Manure,Leaching (agriculture),Fertilizer,Eutrophication,Economics,Crop yield,Agronomy,Agriculture,Nitrogen,Nanotechnology,Environmental chemistry,Workforce,Urbanization,Sustainability,Rhizobia,Pasture,Legume,Nitrous oxide,Nitrogen cycle,Nitrite,Nutrient pollution,Nitrogen,Manure,Tillage,Soil water,Nitrous oxide,Tillage,Soil respiration,Soil carbon,Uncertainty analysis,Sampling bias,Sampling (statistics),Phosphorus,Nutrient,Nitrate,Urease,Soil water,Nitrification","A Sanz-Cobena,L Lassaletta,F Estellés,A Del Prado,G Guardia,D Abalos,E Aguilera,G Pardo,A Vallejo,M A Sutton,J Garnier,G Billen,Jan Willem Erisman,Mark A.

Serious water shortages have negative impacts on regional socioeconomic development. Recent years have witnessed changes in streamflow processes due to increasing human activities, such as agricultural activities and construction of dams and water reservoirs, and climatic changes, e.g. precipitation and temperature. This study attempts to investigate factors potentially driving changes in different streamflow components defined by different quantiles. The data used were daily streamflow data for the 1959–2005 period from 5 hydrological stations, daily precipitation and temperature data from 77 meteorological stations and data pertaining to cropland and large reservoirs. Results indicate a general decrease in streamflow across the Yellow River basin. Moreover significant decreasing streamflow has been observed in the middle and lower Yellow River basin with change points during the mid-1980s till the mid-1990s. The changes of cropland affect the streamflow components and also the cumulative effects on streamflow variations. Recent years have witnessed moderate cropland variations which result in moderate streamflow changes. Further, precipitation also plays a critical role in changes of streamflow components and human activities, i.e. cropland changes, temperature changes and building of water reservoirs, tend to have increasing impacts on hydrological processes across the Yellow River basin. This study provides a theoretical framework for the study of the hydrological effects of human activities and climatic changes on basins over the globe.","Streamflow,Precipitation,Hydrology,Geomorphology,Geology,Flood forecasting,Drainage basin,Cumulative effects,China,Arid,Agriculture,Statistics,Parametric statistics,Parametric model,Statistics,Statistical hypothesis testing,R package,Water supply,Water cycle,Streamflow,Statistics,Statistical model,Skew,Trend analysis,Test statistic,Student's t-test,Water balance,Surface runoff,Streamflow,Weathering,Soil water,Precipitation,Surface runoff,Streamflow,Snowmelt,Statistics,Statistical model,Skewness,Structural basin,Streamflow,Stormwater","Huazhen Li,Qiang Zhang,Vijay P.

525,Carbon footprint of textile throughout its life cycle: a case study of Chinese cotton shirts,2015-01-01,Journal of Cleaner Production,10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2015.05.127,"The carbon footprint (CFP) reflects the greenhouse gases (GHGs) generated throughout the life cycle of a human activity or product, and is therefore an important tool for assessing and managing GHG emissions. At the level of an individual product, a carbon-labeling scheme that provides more information for consumers could play an important role in encouraging a shift to low-carbon consumption. China is the largest textile and garment producer and consumer in the world. Studying the carbon footprint of textiles is therefore important domestically, for the management of domestic greenhouse gas emission and, internationally, for the communication of carbon information and relevant trade negotiations. For establishing the product carbon labeling system in China, this paper constructed an operable and comparable CFP assessment method and framework at product level and presents a complete case for pure cotton shirts made in China. Based on investigations of several Chinese textile companies and the observation of every production sub-process, the system boundary and methods of assessing textile product CFP were established. We then estimated Chinese CFP conversion factors for relevant energy sources and materials, and calculated the actual CFP for the life cycle of a pure cotton shirt. The average CFP of a pure cotton shirt produced in China, throughout its life cycle, is estimated as 8.771 kgCO(2)e. Of this, direct CFP is 0.347 kgCO(2)e, whereas indirect CFP is much higher, at 8.423 kgCO(2)e. The industrial production stage accounts for the highest proportion of the CFP, and overall production (including agricultural and industrial production) accounts for more than 90% of the total CFP. Approximately 96% of CFP throughout the product life cycle is indirect CFP, which is embedded in the use of energy and materials in each process. Within the industrial production stage, the transportation and weaving subprocesses account for nearly all the direct CFP (0.347 kgCO(2)e). Energy consumption, especially of electricity, is the main contributor to the CFP of textile products. These results could facilitate comparison between different products, and for the same products from different producers, In order to reduce the CFP throughout the entire textiles sector.

In this research, we focus on a French peri-urban area in the Parisian region, the Saclay plateau. Following the territorial ecology approach, we consider this territory as a system organizing agricultural, food and waste flows, and we have analyzed the metabolism of this territory through its N, C, P and water flows. The results show first that the metabolism of the Saclay plateau is largely open, i.e. the main flows are input and output flows, and internal flows are small or nonexistent. This is particularly the case for nitrogen and phosphorus flows. The same findings hold for carbon flows although primary production and respiration play the major role in the carbon metabolism. Besides the uncertainty of the available data, water flows also reveal a clear uncoupling between compartments of the system. The analysis of these material flow budgets reveals the high potential for reconnections of the different flows, mainly due to the presence of large areas of agricultural land and a large population. Implementation of biowaste recovery, recovery of human excreta at source, as well as rain recovery systems, could help to realize this potential provided that environmental and sanitary risks can be effectively managed. Developing a foresight approach based on scenarios of territorial metabolism can assist in the building process of a territorial project in periurban areas.","Water resource management,Plateau,Metabolism study,Material flow,High potential,Eutrophication,Environmental engineering,Engineering,Biosphere,Agriculture,Agricultural land,Scarcity,Phosphorus,Phosphorite,Waste disposal,Urine,Population,Water quality,Surface runoff,Spatial heterogeneity,Urbanization,Urban metabolism,Sustainability,Humanities,Art,Value chain,Steady state economy,Monitoring methods,Sociology,Environmental resource management,Environmental planning,Urban planning,Urban metabolism,Urban ecosystem,Organic matter,Lessivage,Leaching (agriculture),Urbanization,Urban sprawl,Urban metabolism","Yoann Verger,Caroline Petit,Sabine Barles,Gilles Billen,Josette Garnier,Fabien Esculier,Pascal Maugis,Dana Cordell,Jan-Olof Drangert,Stuart White,C.

Mediterranean viticulture, projected to experience significant and rapid changes in climate, is used as a case study. We apply an international socio-ecological approach focusing on viticulture in Roussillon (France) and McLaren Vale (Australia). Mixed-methods, including analysis of meteorological data, semi-structured interviews and field observations, guide an analysis of the exposure, sensitivity and adaptation of the two viticultural systems to climate change. We found that the exposure to climate change is likely to become more acute in the two regions by 2060, and that the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of viticultural systems to such change depend strongly on the complex interaction of ecological and socio-economic factors. Most studies focusing on viticulture and climate change are either oriented towards plant physiology, phenological modelling or the economic future of the industry in one region. The research bridges discipline approaches to provide a holistic comparative analysis to guide adaptation, and argues that socio-ecological analyses will become increasingly important to support adaptation decision-making.","Wine industry,Viticulture,Socio ecological,Mediterranean climate,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Comparative case,Climate change,Biology,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Adaptive capacity,Runaway climate change,Physical science,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report,World map,Water resources,Regionalisation,Water resources,Vulnerability index,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Top-down and bottom-up design,Environmental science,Climatology,Socio-ecological system,Regime shift,Psychological resilience,Socio-ecological system,Social science,Psychological resilience,Social network,Social capital,Learning environment,Geography,Environmental systems,Environmental resource management,Vulnerability,Social system,Social capital","Anne-Laure Lereboullet,Gérard Beltrando,Douglas K.

Despite future climate change, current climate variability is already an issue of concern that justifies adaptation efforts. In Brazil, the Semi-Arid Region is a climate hotspot, well known for both historic socioeconomic setbacks, and agriculture failures caused by dry spells and severe droughts. In 2010, the Brazilian government enacted the National Policy on Climate Change, which states as one of its key goals the identification of vulnerabilities and the adoption of adequate measures of adaptation to climate change. The improvement of vulnerability assessment tools is a response to the growing demand of decision makers for regular information and indicators with high spatial and temporal resolution. This article aims at undertaking a comparative assessment of smallholder farming’s vulnerability to droughts.

530,Farming and marketing system affects carbon and water footprint – a case study using Hokaido pumpkin,2012-01-01,Journal of Cleaner Production,10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2011.08.019,"Abstract The objective of the study was to determine the carbon footprint for four farming and marketing systems, using primary data obtained on the farms for autumn pumpkin as an example and model crop. Area for the crop cultivation and weight, i.e. kilogram of saleable product, for the marketing phase were employed as the two functional units with system boundaries from seed acquisition to pumpkin disposal; offset was not used. In the farm carbon footprint (FCF), pumpkins from the organic farm with 240 kg CO 2 eq/ha scored best due to the lowest (50 kg N/ha) (organic) nitrogen application compared with twice that value (448 kg CO 2 eq/ha) for the IP farm. This was due to nitrous oxide emissions, as a consequence of N fertiliser, with 75–99% of FCF in the cultivation phase; it contributed ca. 10% and plant protection (methiocarb in the ‘integrated production’; IP) The large specialised farm showed the best product carbon footprint with 139 g CO 2 eq/kg pumpkin due to use of potassium fertiliser and 3-fold larger yields (18 t/ha versus 5.8 t/ha in the organic [716 g CO 2 eq/kg]) and, to a lesser extent, the scale of the farm business. On the other two farms, cultivation is more extensive with the main income not from pumpkin; any increase in farm size or their pumpkin acreage would not improve their efficacy and product carbon footprint. The imported organic Argentinean pumpkin scored second best with 243 g CO 2 eq/kg despite the long-distance transport due the lower energy consumption of bulk sea freight. The private consumer shopping distance in both cases (retail versus farm shop) amounted to as much as ca. 89% of the product carbon footprint. For a cleaner production, carbon reduction potential appears in improving the potassium fertilisation in all farming systems, except for the large farm, and consumer behaviour regarding the means of transport for shopping. A simple water footprint assessment, based on irrigation and produce washing, resulted in 0.4 (IP), 0.9 L (organic) to 9 L (large scale) blue water/kg pumpkin.","Water use,Waste management,Sustainable agriculture,Organic farming,Irrigation,Integrated production,Economics,Crop,Carbon footprint,Agriculture,Landfill gas utilization,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas accounting,Environmental science,Climatology,Climate change,Organic farming,Intensive farming,Greenhouse gas,Spatial variability,Soil water,Soil texture,Southern Hemisphere,Primary energy,Horticulture,Geography,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Sustainable agriculture,Sugar beet,Greenhouse gas,Water use,Water scarcity,Water resources,Phosphate,Nitrous oxide,Nitrification,Sustainable agriculture,Orchard,Natural resource","Florian Schäfer,Michael Blanke,K.

531,Comparing smallholder farmers’ perception of climate change with meteorological data: A case study from southwestern Nigeria,2017-01-01,Weather and climate extremes,10.1016/J.WACE.2016.12.001,"Abstract This paper examines smallholder farmers’ perceptions of climate change, climate variability and their impacts, and adaptation strategies adopted over the past three decades. We use ethnographic analysis, combined with Cumulative Departure Index (CDI), Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI) analysis, and correlation analysis to compare farmers’ perceptions in Southwestern Nigeria with historical meteorological data, in order to assess the way farmers’ observations mirror the climatic trends. The results show that about 67% of farmers who participated had observed recent changes in climate. Perceptions of rural farmers on climate change and variability are consistent with the climatic trend analysis. RAI and CDI results illustrate that not less than 11 out of 30 years in each study site experienced lower-than-normal rainfall. Climatic trends show fluctuations in both early growing season (EGS) and late growing season (LGS) rainfall and the 5-year moving average suggests a reduction in rainfall over the 30 years. Climatic trends confirmed farmers’ perceptions that EGS and LGS precipitations are oscillating, that rainfall onset is becoming later, and EGS rainfall is reducing. Overall impacts of climate change on both crops and livestock appear to be highly negative, much more on maize (62.8%), yam (52.2%), poultry (67%) and cattle (63.2%).

Recently, ecosystem services have been used as a framework to understand the benefits that protected areas provide local residents. In this study, we explore the role of ecosystem services in residents’ relationships with Gaoligongshan Nature Reserve (GNR) in Yunnan, China. GNR is located in a biodiversity hotspot and in an area that has been affected severe droughts. Results show that the majority of people recognize ecosystem services as benefits from GNR, particularly regulating services such as the provision of water. Respondents who perceived regulating services were more likely to be older, male, of Yi ethnicity, more educated, and grow sugarcane but not corn. However, controlling for residents’ knowledge about GNR, the effects of gender, age, and education decrease or disappear, while ethnicity and agricultural crops grown remain significant. This study demonstrates that people recognize common ground between their livelihoods and GNR and suggests that people’s knowledge about GNR, cultural context, and agricultural experiences influence their appreciation of ecosystem services from GNR. This study highlights that protected area conservation, if conducted with awareness of people’s already-existing perceptions of benefits, can begin with a discussion of win–win scenarios.","Socioeconomics,Protected area,Nature reserve,Livelihood,Ethnic group,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,China,Biology,Biodiversity hotspot,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Theory of reasoned action,Theory of planned behavior,Technology acceptance model,Typology,Resource management,Natural resource management,Sustainable management,Social progress,Poverty,Geography,Future climate,Forest cover,Willingness to pay,Valuation (finance),Poverty,Rainforest,Payment,Livelihood,Sustenance,Southeast asian,Provisioning,Social perception,Residence,Relocation,Total human ecosystem,Stock and flow,Natural capital,Wildlife,Tourism,Recreation","T.D.

As a mean of two surveys, the average dietary diversity scores (DDS) of households and women were low, implying low household economic access to food and low women’s dietary quality. The Food Consumption Score (FCS) showed that acceptable levels of food consumption were realized over seven consecutive days in the 2014 survey by the majority of households (83%) and women (90%). While there was no strong association between the food scores and seven farm diversity indicators, both food scores were significantly associated with the household’s wealth status, ethnicity of both the household head and the spouse, and the education level of the spouse.

In order to encompass the evolutionary processes of tourism development within rural areas, an evolutionary approach is proposed. If the attention moves from a static analysis of RT within a region, to the transition from a basic rural economy to a new economic specialisation, then the evolutionary economic geography (EEG) may be a useful framework. The EEG explains economical transitions as a shift from a historically predominant configuration to a new one, by the interplay of processes at three different levels: micro (local), meso (regional) and macro (European). The aim of this paper is to adapt the EEG approach to the study of RT. In this paper, the framework is applied to the case study of RT in Tuscany. We argue that in Tuscany the rural transition towards a tourism development was fostered by the weakness of the established rural configuration and its heritage of a large availability of empty buildings, which has been a primary input for tourism development. New trends at the macro-level fostered the transition towards RT, in particular the European funding for multifunctionality within agriculture and urban people seeking for natural life-style.","Tourism geography,Tourism,Sociology,Rural tourism,Rural economics,Rural area,Macro,Erikson's stages of psychosocial development,Environmental protection,Agriculture,Structure and agency,Structuration theory,Sociology,Path dependency,Path dependence,Path creation,Returns to scale,Path dependence,Path creation,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Sociology,Shift-share analysis,Path dependence,Path creation,Strategic geography,International trade,International English,Tourism,Rural tourism,Rural sociology,Evolutionary economics,Evolutionary ecology,Economics,Tourism geography,Tourism,Sustainable tourism,Sustainability,Rural tourism,Rural development","Filippo Randelli,Patrizia Romei,Marco Tortora,Anthony Giddens,Paul A David,W.

One scenario assumes a year when every province has precipitation corresponding to the lowest level experienced in the province over the last three decades. Another scenario assumes the highest experienced precipitation for every province is happening; and the last one assumes that the most harmful level of precipitation on crops occurs for every province – whether too little or too much. We studied the role of autonomous adaptation by farmers and through markets as embodied in a computable general equilibrium model. The results show that observed extreme impacts of precipitation on crop harvests are not serious for China at national level. The maize harvest is the most negatively affected with a reduction of 4 % without adaptation and less than 1 % reduction with adaptation. However, the impacts within a province may be serious and even become worse with adaptation. Good harvests might not make farmers better off due to lower crop prices even though consumers benefit. Sensitivity analysis shows that the ability to adapt assumed in the analysis may not be present in the short term.","Precipitation,General equilibrium theory,Food security,Extreme weather,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Economics,Computable general equilibrium,Climate change,China,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Vulnerability,Group ii,Environmental science,South asia,Natural resource economics,Malnutrition,Yearbook,Library science,Economics,Hot Temperature,Growing season,Greenhouse effect,Water resources,Population,Political economy of climate change,Natural resource economics,Global warming,Geography,World economy,Stock and flow,Policy analysis,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Rural poverty,Food systems,Water flow,Survey data collection,Global warming,Poaceae,Meteorology,Future climate","Taoyuan Wei,Solveig Glomsrød,Tianyi Zhang,Tarekegn Abeku,Pamela Abuodha,Francis Adesina,Neil Adger,John Agard,David B.

Therefore, field-testing and evaluation of water conservation methods, i.e. laser land leveling in new farming systems of Central Asia is important task. This in mind the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and its regional partner on IWRM FV (IWRM FV project - Integrated Water Resources Management in Ferghana Valley project is funded by Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) and conducted jointly with IWMI and Scientific Information Center of Interstate Coordination Water Commission (SIC ICWC) in the Ferghana Valley of Central Asia) project SIC ICWC have conducted 3 year study of impacts of the Laser leveled land leveling on water use, productivity and crop yields in northern Tajikistan. The major research question was laser land leveling an effective water saving tool in the new context of land use and ownership on smaller private plots. Can farmers afford the costs of laser land leveling and how economically viable is it? These research questions were studied in 5 ha laser leveled and neighboring non-leveled (control) fields for 2004-2006. The results showed that laser land leveling can reduce the water application rate in 2004 by 593 M 3 /ha, in 2005 by 1509 M 3 /ha and in 2006 by 333 M 3 /ha in comparison with the unleveled field, located in the similar agro-ecological conditions. The deep percolation was 8% lower and run off 24% less than in non-leveled field. The average annual net income from the laser field was 22% higher than that from the control field. The gross margin from the laser-leveled field were 16. 88 and 171% higher compared to that from the control field for 2004, 2005 and 2006, and on average was 92% higher. In spite of these positive results, there are hindrances on wide application of laser land leveling in Tajikistan. These are absence of initial capital of farmers and scattered land location.","Water use,Water resource management,Water conservation,Surface runoff,Land use,Land degradation,Integrated water resources management,Hydrology,Gross margin,Engineering,Agriculture,Water use,Water resources,Water conservation,Water use,Water supply,Water resource management,Soil series,Soil pH,Soil management,Water resources,Water resource management,Water balance,Partial budgeting,Mathematics,Land leveling,Tillage,Surface irrigation,Structural basin,Regression analysis,Pesticide,Irrigation,Soil management,Shifting cultivation,Scarcity,Natural resource economics,Levelling,Land restoration,Geography,Environmental ethics,Agriculture","Iskandar Abdullaev,Mehmood Ul Hassan,Kahramon Jumaboev,Jacob W.

The agroforestry system can serve as a source of non-coffee products for diverse purposes. This study focuses on the role of shade trees in smallholder coffee farms, examining the wood products derived from the shaded coffee system. Data presented from surveys with 185 growers in Peru and 153 growers in Guatemala show that the consumption and sale of all non-coffee products account for a fifth to a third of the total value realized from the agroforestry system. Fuelwood and construction materials account for much of this value. Differences seen between countries can be traced to agricultural intensification – the degree to which the coffee agroforestry system is “technified” (i.e., managed with a reduced shade tree cover and diversity, high-yielding cultivars, agrochemical inputs, etc.) – as well as the relative demand for wood resources and farmers’ access to natural forest systems.","Tropics,Shade tree,Natural forest,Cultivar,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agrochemical,Agriculture,Agricultural intensification,Species richness,Riparian zone,Pollinator,Environmental resource management,Environmental impact assessment,Crop production,Shade-grown coffee,Habitat,Ecology,Theobroma,Silviculture,Shade tree,Tropics,Tropical agriculture,Theobroma,Sustainability,Social equality,Poverty,Tropical agriculture,Shrub,Pollinator,Tree breeding,Subsistence agriculture,Germplasm,Tropics,Shading,Rubiaceae,Sustainability,Resource management,Perception","Robert A.

545,A Consensus Proposal for Nutritional Indicators to Assess the Sustainability of a Healthy Diet: The Mediterranean Diet as a Case Study,2016-01-01,Frontiers in Nutrition,10.3389/FNUT.2016.00037,"Background: There is increasing evidence of the multiple effects of diets on public health nutrition, society and environment. Sustainability and food security are closely inter-related. The traditional Mediterranean Diet (MD) is recognized as a healthier dietary pattern with a lower environmental impact. As a case study, the MD may guide innovative inter-sectorial efforts to counteract the degradation of ecosystems, loss of biodiversity and homogeneity of diets due to globalization, through the improvement of sustainable healthy dietary patterns. This consensus position paper defines a suite of the most appropriate nutrition and health indicators for assessing the sustainability of diets based on the MD. Methods: In 2011, an informal International Working Group from different national and international institutions was convened. Through online and face-to-face brainstorming meetings over four years, a set of nutrition and health indicators for sustainability was identified and refined. Results: Thirteen nutrition indicators of sustainability relating were identified in five areas: • Biochemical characteristics of food (A1. Vegetable/animal protein consumption ratios; (A2. Average dietary energy adequacy; (A3. Dietary energy density score; (A4. Nutrient density of diet): • Food Quality (A5. Fruit and vegetable consumption/intakes; (A6. Dietary diversity score): • Environment (A7. Food biodiversity composition and consumption; (A8. Rate of Local/regional foods and seasonality; (A9. Rate of eco-friendly food production and/or consumption): • Lifestyle (A10. Physical activity/Physical inactivity prevalence; (A11. Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern) • Clinical Aspects; (A12. Diet-related morbidity/mortality statistics; (A13. Nutritional Anthropometry. A standardized set of information was provided for each indicator: definition, methodology, background, data sources, limitations of the indicator and references. Conclusions: The selection and analysis of these indicators has been performed (where possible) with specific reference to the MD. Sustainability of food systems is an urgent priority for governments and international organisations to address the serious socioeconomic and environmental implications of short-sighted and short-term practices for agricultural land and rural communities. These proposed nutrition indicators will be a useful methodological framework for designing health, education and agricultural policies in order, not only to conserve the traditional diets of the Mediterranean area as a common cultural heritage and lifestyle, but also to enhance the","Sustainability,Public health,Mediterranean diet,Medicine,Internal medicine,Health indicator,Food systems,Food security,Food processing,Environmental resource management,Environmental health,Endocrinology,Agriculture,Surgery,Prospective cohort study,Proportional hazards model,Urbanization,Sustainability,Public health,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Greenhouse gas,Food systems,Urbanization,Nutrition transition,Free trade,Risk assessment,Relative risk,Public health,Nutritional status,Nutrition assessment,Mini nutritional assessment,Sociocultural evolution,Pyramid,Public health,Standardized mortality ratio,Prospective cohort study,Population,Serving size,Portion size,Overweight,Saturated fat,Red meat,Palatability","Lorenzo M.

546,Moving down the cause-effect chain of water and land use impacts: An LCA case study of textile fibres,2013-01-01,Resources Conservation and Recycling,10.1016/J.RESCONREC.2013.01.020,"Environmental impacts of water and land use are often omitted or treated in an over-simplified manner in life cycle assessments (LCAs). This may provide insufficient foundation for LCA-based decision-making when product life cycles include agriculture or forestry. The aim of this paper is to assess water and land use impacts of biobased textile fibres and contribute to the development of methods for characterising such impacts in LCA. This was done by applying and developing methods suggested in literature to an LCA case study of a wood-based textile fibre under development. The water use assessment method considers water deprivation at the midpoint level and the impact on human health, ecosystem quality and resources at the endpoint level. The land use assessment method measures the impact on biodiversity, by considering changes in the vascular plant species richness and the vulnerability of the surrounding ecosystem. In the case study, five wood-based fibre production scenarios were set up in order to account for uncertainties in the future location of operations. For comparison, two cotton production scenarios were set up. An innovative consequential approach was applied in the inventory analysis of water use, in order to capture the system-scale effects of how forestry and cotton farming influence the hydrological cycle. This was compared to a more traditional attributional approach. The results show that the location of operations influences water use impacts, as water extracted from relatively water stressed environments leads to higher impacts. Furthermore, for some scenarios, the result differed considerably between the consequential and attributional inventory approaches. Moreover, it is shown that the consequential approach adds the possibility of recognising increased runoff as a potential benefit of certain types of land use. Biodiversity impacts from the transformation of natural land are much higher than impacts from the occupation of land. If transformation of land takes place, and all impact is allocated to the first harvest, cotton production appears to have a particularly high impact. However, if the transformational impact is allocated over several subsequent harvests, the impact of cotton and wood-based fibres becomes more similar. How to handle this allocation problem deserves further attention in the development of characterisation methods for land use impacts. The study has contributed to the development of characterisation methods by developing a water use inventory approach and by illuminating several methodological aspects of both water and land use impact assessment which need further research.","Water use,Water cycle,Waste management,Surface runoff,Life-cycle assessment,Land use,Inventory analysis,Impact assessment,Environmental engineering,Engineering,Agriculture,Product system,Operations research,Life-cycle assessment,Water use,Water supply,Life-cycle assessment,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Water resources,Operations research,Life-cycle assessment,ILCD,Sweet sorghum,Sugar,Renewable resource,Water use,Water resources,Water resource management,Wet season,Watershed,Soil water,Scientific consensus,Life-cycle assessment,Life cycle inventory,Waste management,Soil quality,Natural resource,Western europe,Water balance,Scientific debate","Gustav A Sandin,Gregory Peters,Magdalena Svanström,Jeroen B.

547,"Climate Change Adaptation Strategies of Smallholder Farmers: The Case of Babilie District, East Harerghe Zone of Oromia Regional State of Ethiopia",2011-01-01,Journal of economics and sustainable development,,"Climate change is a global phenomenon. Its impact on agricultural activities in the developing countries has been increasing. Higher temperature and decreasing precipitation levels caused by climate change depresses crop yields. This is particularly true in low-income countries where adaptive capacities are perceived to be low. The vulnerability of poor countries could be due to weak institutional capacity, limited engagement in environmental and adaptation issues, and lack of validation of local knowledge. A better understanding of the local dimensions of vulnerability is therefore essential to develop appropriate adaptation measures that can mitigate these adverse consequences. The main aim of this study was to identify the determinants of farmer’s choice of adaptation strategies to climate change in the Babilie district of Eastern Ethiopia. Both primary and secondary data sources were used for this study. Primary data were collected from a randomly selected 160 sample households interviewed through a semi-structured questionnaire, key informants interview and focus group discussion. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was estimated to analyze the factors influencing households’ choice of adaptation strategies to climate change. The result from the multinomial logit analysis showed that sex of the household head, age of the household head and education of the household head, family size, livestock ownership, household farm income, non/off farm income, access to credit, distance to the market center, access to farmer-to-farmer extension, agro ecological zones, access to climate information, and extension contact have a significant impact on climate change adaptation strategies. Therefore, future policy should focus on awareness creation on climate change through different sources such as mass media and extension, encouraging informal social net-works, facilitating the availability of credit, enhancing research on use of new crop varieties that are more suited to drier conditions and different agro ecological zones.

In that case, without limit or warning, this pollution may affect human health, agricultural, forest species and ecosystems. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the monthly and seasonal variations of Air Pollution Index (API) at all monitoring stations in Johor. Approach: In this study, time series models will be discussed to analyze future air quality and used in modeling and forecasting monthly future air quality in Malaysia. A Box-Jenkins ARIMA approach was applied in order to analyze the API values in Johor. Results: In all this three stations, high values recorded at sekolah menengah pasir gudang dua (CA0001). This situation indicates that the most polluted area in Johor located in Pasir Gudang.

However, more work is still necessary to enable a full appraisal of the potential benefits of this way of farming, since studies differ in the evaluation of its effectiveness. Studies are particularly scarce in the Mediterranean region, where different climatic and ecological conditions prevent simple extrapolations from work carried out at northern latitudes. In the present study, an analysis of weed and arthropod communities was conducted in 28 pairs of organic and conventional fields in a dry cereal farmland in central Spain. Plants were identified to the species level, and arthropods to the family level. Pitfalls and sweep nets were used to sample respectively, ground-dwelling and plant-visiting arthropods. Abundance (total numbers of individuals), richness (total numbers of plant species or arthropod families), diversity (Shannon–Wiener index) and biomass (milligrams per pitfall/sweep-net) were calculated for each field and compared between organic and conventional fields using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs). To explore the effect of predictor variables on weed richness and arthropod biomass, GLMMs were used. Organic fields showed higher abundance of weeds and arthropods (3.01 and 1.43 times, respectively), higher weed richness and diversity (2.76 and 2.33 times, respectively), and a 24% reduction in cereal plants. Arthropod diversity was lower in organic fields due to the presence of three dominant groups: Collembola, Chloropidae (Diptera), and Aphididae (Hemiptera). Weed richness increased as cereal cover decreased in organic fields. Total arthropod biomass was slightly higher in organic fields, and was affected by weed abundance and diversity. The differences between organic and conventional fields found in this study were higher than those reported for northern latitudes. This could be explained by the richer weed flora in the Mediterranean region, and a higher weed seed availability favored by the two-year rotation system typical of Iberian dry cereal farmland. We conclude that organic farming may contribute to preserve biodiversity in dryland cereal agroecosystems in the Mediterranean region.","Weed,Species richness,Organic farming,Mediterranean climate,Ecology,Biomass,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecosystem,Agriculture,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Geography,Environmental resource management,Geography,Ecosystem diversity,Ecosystem,Mixed model,Medicine,Predictive inference,Multimodel inference,Model selection,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Species richness,Population density,Organic farming,Vegetation,Umbrella species,Measurement of biodiversity,Species diversity,Predation,Pesticide","Carlos Ponce,Carolina Bravo,David García de León,Marina Magaña,Juan Carlos Alonso,Jonathan A.

A structured questionnaire was administered to 150 farmers in four Local Government Areas in Delta state. Frequency counts and percentages were used to analyse the data collected. The findings revealed that lack of inputs, lack of credit facilities, high production cost are some of the constraints to sustainable development. The study also revealed among others the causes of the constraints, which include high lending interest rate, diversion of loan by farmers, low exchange rate of the Naira and old age of the rubber trees. On the socio­–economic characteristics of the farmers, it was discovered that the older farmers (over 49 years old) were more involved in rubber production with 79 percent accounting for a low level of education.

The results revealed that farming experience, gender and marital status have positive significant effect on farmers’ decision to use credit. In contrast, farmers’ age, education level and membership to farmers’ association had negative significant effect. The study recommends training on the benefits of farm credit among both borrowers and non-borrowers in rural areas. Most borrowers as male-headed and this imply that targeting female-headed households will most likely improve their likelihood of taking credit.

Whether this phenomenon was accompanied by increasing specialization of the economy may be investigated through the zooarchaeology of pastoral systems. The scale of herding is an important element of this framework. A case study was conducted on the tell sites of Hârsova and Bordusani-Popină situated in the Danube River basin. Both sites, located respectively on a terrace of the river and on the island of Balta Ialomiţei, delivered occupations from the Gumelniţa A2 dated to the second half of 5th millennium cal BC. Their occupants subsisted on an economy focused to a large extent on aquatic resources but also heavily dependent on cattle, pig and caprines husbandry and agriculture. The role of riverbanks resources in herding strategies and the extent to which the island of Balta Ialomiţei may have sustained domestic animal stocks was addressed through stable isotope analysis of animal skeleton remains. At both sites, results revealed local herding for cattle and caprines, reflected in an unexpectedly high contribution of C4 plants to their diet, most likely from ruderal C4 plants that are more abundant around the settlements as well as in cultivated fields. Domestic pigs had a higher trophic status than their wild counterparts, highlighting a significant contribution of animal protein to their diet most likely provided by human activities, suggesting that they were maintained in the settlement. Overall the findings suggest domestic stocks were reared in close proximity to the settlements, rather than in an extensive system. This scheme complements the small-scale cultivation system highlighted from the archaeobotanical analysis. Gumelniţa tell sites have been previously described as being part of larger pastoral systems including locations with complementary functions, although functional complementarity in time was not made explicit in this model. In this regard, the results obtained at Hârsova and Bordusani-Popină are not in favour of large-scale seasonal mobility.","Zooarchaeology,Trophic level,Ruderal species,Human settlement,Herding,Geology,Ecology,Chalcolithic,Agriculture,5th millennium BC,Stable isotope ratio,Precipitation,Paleoclimatology,δ13C,Stable isotope ratio,Paleoecology,Ungulate,Tooth enamel,Ruminant,Stable isotope ratio,Mineralogy,Materials science,Stable isotope ratio,Paleontology,Nitrogen,Zoology,Stable isotope ratio,Paleontology,Stable isotope ratio,Ourebia ourebi,Isotope analysis,δ15N,δ13C,Zoology,Stable isotope ratio,Oxygen isotope ratio cycle,Meteoric water,δ18O,Tooth enamel,Population","Marie Balasse,Adrian Bălăşescu,Carlos Tornero,Delphine Fremondeau,Roman Hovsepyan,Rosalind Gillis,Dragomir Popovici,Kazimierz Rozanski,Luis Araguás‐Araguás,Roberto Gonfiantini,Matthew J.

We use a coupled climate-crop-economy modeling system to analyze the value of climate information (VOI) in Spain for the domestic agricultural sector and for international agricultural markets. Climate variability in Spain is represented by the observed variability over a 30 year history. We assume perfect accuracy of seasonal climate forecasting but distinguish conservative and proactive crop mix adjustments. We also contrast nationally restricted dissemination of Spanish climate forecasts versus global dissemination. Averaged over the simulated climate states, the global benefits of Spanish climate forecasts range between 61 and 189 million US$ per year. Agricultural consumers in Spain gain between 0.8 and 2.9 percent and Spanish farm revenues increase between 1.9 and 7.0 percent. If Spanish farmers consider crop mix choices outside historical bounds (proactive reaction) their revenues are notably higher than otherwise (conservative reaction). The VOI under favorable climate conditions is greater than under adverse climate conditions. When adverse climate conditions are forecast, negative VOI could materialize for the Spanish farmers because of production and welfare transfers from Spain to other countries. Information sharing of Spanish climate predictions with the rest of the world (ROW) increases not only global welfare but also Spanish producers' benefits. Finally, climate forecasting promotes a more efficient use of agricultural resources. The agricultural efficiency increase due to climate forecasts translates into welfare-neutral land savings of 2 percent in Spain.","Welfare,Value of information,Revenue,Natural resource economics,Land use,Information sharing,Environmental resource management,Economics,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Runaway climate change,Physical science,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report,Vulnerability,Sustainability,Latin Americans,Public administration,Political science,Group ii,Environmental science,Climatology,Stochastic programming,Stochastic linear programming,Stochastic integer programming,Geography,Agroforestry,Agricultural science,Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem,Two-moment decision model,Subjective expected utility,Seasonal forecasting,Probabilistic logic,Physics,Temperate climate,Stem elongation,Nitrogen fertilization,Welfare,Rural ethiopia,Poverty","Hyung Sik Choi,Uwe A.

555,Transforming Pastoralism: A Case Study of the Rufa'a Al-Hoi Ethnic Group in the Blue Nile State of Sudan,2009-01-01,Nomadic Peoples,10.3167/NP.2009.130107,"Abstract The pastoral sector in the Blue Nile State (Sudan) has been marginalized and impoverished as a result of detrimental state policies, deteriorating environmental conditions and an encroaching civil war. To survive these assaults, poor households among the Rufa'a Al-Hoi group had to settle and engage in activities remotely related to the pastoral sector. However, they found that their circumstances actually improved by gaining access to a number of social and other types of services previously unavailable. Contrary to conventional wisdom, these particular Rufa'a households found their quality of life improving under their new circumstances and did not attempt to return to pastoralism. Recently, such choices attracted other well-to-do pastoral households from the same ethnic group to settle, engage in agriculture and small business and keep some of their livestock on the move with herders, thus transforming their system of livelihood in order to both cope and reap the benefits from the changing situation. Keywords: Nomadic settlement, pastoral transformation, resource competition, Rufa'a Al-Hoi, Sudan Introduction Pastoralism, a form of natural resource use and management that is commonly combined with other productive pursuits such as small-scale agriculture, gum tapping and woodcutting, is one of the major features of the Blue Nile State. This production system, like those in many other parts of Sudan, is undergoing a rapid process of intensified commercialization. In recent years the livestock sector, which is predominantly in the hands of pastoralists, has contributed significantly to the gross domestic product (GDP) and has emerged as a leading foreign exchange earner in the national economy, second only to the recently established oil sector. Its contribution in the years 2000-2004 averaged 20 per cent of GDP and over 30 per cent of total agricultural exports (cf. Nur 2001, Sammani and Salih 2006). However, the performance in this sector is not a reflection of high growth rates in the national herds, but rather a manifestation and consequence of varied and complex marginalization and impoverishment processes, underlined primarily by detrimental state policies, steadily deteriorating environmental conditions and an intensified insecurity generated by civil war, intergroup conflicts and banditry. Detrimental consequences and environmental conditions notwithstanding, the most serious threat to pastoral production in the Blue Nile State rests in the growing inability of pastoralists to maintain their rights to use grazing lands. They are faced with the challenge of developing adaptable and flexible livelihood strategies composed of activities that generate the means of household survival. Such strategies have to change as the external environment over which they have control changes. Herd owners endure severe constraints on the imperative pastoral movements that are otherwise vital in maintaining the viability of their productive pursuits (UNDP 2001). Understanding the performance of this sector under current circumstances 'needs a perspective that takes into consideration broad socioeconomic causes, as these are interlinked with factors such as demographic growth, agricultural stagnation, the incorporation of the pastoral economy into the market economy, general insecurity arising from civil war and conflicts, faulty national and international policies, as well as factors linked to climate and ecology. These processes have led to rapid sedentarization and urbanization, the breakdown of traditional structures, transformation of gender relations, degradation of natural resources and growing vulnerability of groups to ecological and economic stress' (Manger 2001:21). To counter the possible negative impacts of pressure arising from such causes and factors, economic diversification together with the structural transformation of the social and political systems is essential for maintaining an adaptive livelihood system. …","Urbanization,Pastoralism,Natural resource,Livelihood,Gross domestic product,Forestry,Environmental protection,Economics,Diversification (marketing strategy),Development economics,Conventional wisdom,Agriculture,Sustainable development,Social transformation,Political economy,Sociology,Rangeland,Population density,Subsistence agriculture,Population,Livestock,Vulnerability,Sociology,Social system,Sociology,Politics,Gender studies","Abdel Ghaffar M.

METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study with cases (n=321) recruited through the New Zealand Motor Neurone Disease Association and hospital discharge data. Controls (n=605) were recruited from the Electoral Roll. Information on personal and demographic details, lifestyle factors and a full occupational history was collected using questionnaires and interviews. Associations with ever/never employed and employment duration were estimated using logistic regression stratified by sex and adjusted for age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, education and smoking. RESULTS: Elevated risks were observed for field crop and vegetable growers (OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.10 to 7.77); fruit growers (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.78); gardeners and nursery growers (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.82); crop and livestock producers (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.44 to 9.02); fishery workers, hunters and trappers (OR 5.62, 95% CI 1.27 to 24.97); builders (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.41 to 5.96); electricians (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.34 to 9.74); caregivers (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.79); forecourt attendants (OR 8.31, 95% CI 1.79 to 38.54); plant and machine operators and assemblers (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.01); telecommunications technicians (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.20 to 14.64); and draughting technicians (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.07 to 8.53). Industries with increased risks were agriculture (particularly horticulture and fruit growing), construction, non-residential care services, motor vehicle retailing, and sport and recreation. Positive associations between employment duration and MND were shown for the occupations fruit growers, gardeners and nursery growers, and crop and livestock producers, and for the horticulture and fruit growing industry. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests associations between MND and occupations in agriculture and several other occupations.","Socioeconomics,Socioeconomic status,Recreation,Public health,Population,Physical therapy,Medicine,Livestock,Ethnic group,Epidemiology,Agriculture,Medicine,Anatomy,Sociology,Public health,Hospital epidemiology,Viral infection,Symptom onset,Physical fitness,Virology,Odds ratio,Odds,Prevalence,Population,Physical therapy,Socioeconomic status,Population,Physical therapy,Young adult,Smoking cessation,Population,Risk factor,Physical therapy,Meta-analysis,Relative risk,Occupational safety and health,Occupational exposure,Risk factor,Prospective cohort study,Proportional hazards model","Grace Xia Chen,Andrea Martine ’t Mannetje,Jeroen Douwes,Leonard van den Berg,Matthew C Kiernan,Steve Vucic,Benjamin C Cheah,Martin R Turner,Andrew Eisen,Clare Salmond,Peter Crampton,June Atkinson,Caroline Ingre,Per M Roos,Fredrik Piehl,Freya Kamel,Fang Fang,Aisha S Dickerson,Johnni Hansen,Ole Gredal,Marc G Weisskopf,Alvaro Alonso,Giancarlo Logroscino,Susan S.

557,Synergies and tradeoffs between cash crop production and food security: a case study in rural Ghana,2014-01-01,Food Security,10.1007/S12571-014-0360-6,"Despite dramatic improvements in global crop yields over the past half-century, chronic food insecurity persists in many parts of the world. Farming crops for sale (cash cropping) has been recommended as a way to increase income that can, in turn, improve food security for smallholder farmers. Despite long-term efforts by development agencies and government to promote cash cropping, there is limited evidence documenting a relationship between these crops and the food security of households cultivating them. We used a mixed methods approach to build a case study to assess these relationships by collecting quantitative and qualitative data from cacao and oil palm farmers in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Three dimensions of food security were considered: food availability, measured by the months in a year households reported inadequate food; food access, indicated by the coping strategies they employed to secure sufficient food; and food utilization, gauged by the diversity of household diets and anthropometric measurements of child nutritional status. We found significant negative relationships between each of these pillars of food security and a household’s intensity of cash crop production, measured by both quantity and area. A qualitative assessment indicated community perception of these tradeoffs and identified potential mechanisms, including increasing food prices and competing activities for land use, as underlying causes. The adverse relationship between cash crop production and household food security observed in this paper calls for caution; results suggest that positive relationships cannot be assumed, and that further empirical evidence is needed to better understand these tradeoffs.","Land use,Food systems,Food security,Food prices,Environmental resource management,Economics,Cropping,Cash crop,Cash,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainable development,Poverty,Food security,Socioeconomic status,Population,Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys,Statistics,Standardized coefficient,Standard deviation,Geography,Food insecurity,Environmental health,Toxicology,Physical therapy,Nutrient,Wasting,Raw data,Population,Sustainability,Socioeconomics,School feeding,Surgery,Socioeconomics,Sanitation,West africa,Urban area,Socioeconomics","Tal Lee Anderman,Roseline Remans,Stephen A.

This study provides the analysis of the current situation and trends in promoting food security at the global level, more precisely, in the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union. We have examined the world experience in food security provision. In this respect, the leading role is currently played by the UN, European Union and by the World Health Organization. These institutions have developed practical recommendations to improve food security. The conditions of food security in the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union are determined by the authors. We also have substantiated the expediency of the proposed cluster approach to food industry development, as well as related industries. It affects productivity improvement, creates opportunities for innovation and fosters new business. Enterprises of all forms of ownership can be easily integrated in a cluster. In this case, agricultural activities are of particular interest not only as a source of food for the population, but also as a source of fodder that is critical for animal husbandry, providing meat and dairy products.","Population,International trade,Food supply,Food security,Food industry,European union,Economic union,Business,Animal husbandry,Agriculture,Production quality,Business,Agricultural engineering,The Republic,State management,National security","Salima Mizanbekova,Maira Uspanova,Dana Kunanbaeva,Салима Мизанбекова,Salima Mizanbekova,Ирина Богомолова,Irina Bogomolova,Наталья Шатохина,С.

Across China, the DON deposition was substantially larger than that of world and Europe, and we found significant positive correlation between contribution of DON and the deposition flux with pristine site data lying in outlier, possibly reflecting the acute air quality problems in China. For a case study in Northeast China, we revealed the deposited DON was mainly derived from intensive agricultural activities rather than the natural sources by analyzing the compiled dataset across China and correlating DON flux with NH 4 + –N and NO 3 − –N. Crop pollens and combustion of fossil fuels for heating probably contributed to summer and autumn DON flux respectively. Overall, in Northeast China, DON deposition could exert important roles in agro-ecosystem nutrient management and carbon sequestration of natural ecosystems; nationally, it was suggested to found rational network for monitoring DON deposition.","Precipitation,Nutrient management,Hydrology,Fossil fuel,Flux,Environmental chemistry,China,Chemistry,Carbon sequestration,Atmospheric sciences,Air quality index,Agriculture,Reactive nitrogen,Nitrogen cycle,Industrial production,Surface water,Reactive nitrogen,Pelagic zone,Terrestrial ecosystem,Nitrogen cycle,Nitrogen,Tundra,Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands,Terrestrial ecosystem,Terrestrial ecosystem,Soil water,Protein depolymerization,Woody plant,Terrestrial ecosystem,Plant species,Soil water,Plant nutrition,Nitrogen cycle,Southern china,Pollution,Nitrogen deposition,Terrestrial ecosystem,Temperate climate,Soil water,Vegetation,Trend surface analysis,Precipitation","C.M.

Based on 41 sustainability indicators covering the three dimensions of sustainability, this method is designed as a self-assessment tool not only for farmers but also for policy makers to support sustainable agriculture. The scientific approach is based on identifying three different scales of sustainability. The application of the IDEA method is illustrated using French case studies. Linking the IDEA method with the Farm Accounting Data Network is noted as an interesting possibility to assess the sustainability level of different farming systems. The conclusion is that there is not just one farm sustainability model, and therefore the indicators must be adapted to local farming before using the IDEA method.

561,"Analysing trade-offs in resource and labour allocation by smallholder farmers using inverse modelling techniques: A case-study from Kakamega district, western Kenya",2007-01-01,Agricultural Systems,10.1016/J.AGSY.2007.04.002,"Abstract Smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa face multiple trade-offs when deciding on the allocation of their financial, labour and nutrient resources. Day-to-day decisions have implications for the sustainability of their farming system, implying multiple trade-offs between short- and long-term objectives that have biophysical and socio-economic dimensions. We show that inverse modelling techniques can be used effectively for optimisation and trade-offs analysis of farming systems. By combining the multi-objective shuffled complex evolution metropolis algorithm and a crop/soil dynamic simulation model we were able to select farming strategies that resulted in the best possible trade-offs between different farming objectives. This integrated analytical tool allows optimisation of farmers’ goals similar to linear programming, but an advantage over linear programming is that the proposed method takes into account a wider spectrum of biophysical processes including their interactions and feedbacks. Tradeoffs between resource productivity, use efficiency and conservation in relation to different patterns of resource allocation were analysed for a maize-based, simplified case study farm from western Kenya (2.2 ha – comprising fields of poor, medium and high soil fertility), under three scenarios of financial liquidity to invest in labour and inputs (2000, 5000 and 10,000 KSh ha−1; 75 KSh = 1 US$). The maximum farm-scale maize production achieved was larger when financial resources increased. However, increasing maize yields above a certain threshold by applying mineral fertilisers was associated with larger N losses by leaching, runoff and soil erosion; such threshold was 2.7 t grain ha−1 for the scenario of no financial limitations (10,000 KSh ha−1). N losses at farm scale fluctuated between 36 and 54 kg N ha−1 season−1, while the maximum maize yields achieved were around 3.4 t grain ha−1. Soil losses by erosion increased abruptly beyond a certain maize yield (e.g. 1.8 t grain ha−1 for the 2000 KSh ha−1 scenario), while the minimum rate of soil loss differed between financial scenarios. Investments in hiring labour were prioritised over fertiliser use to obtain the greatest yields and the allocation of available resources favoured the more fertile fields. This inverse modelling exercise allowed us to analyse trade-offs between different farmers’ objectives and to compare potential resource allocation strategies to achieve them. The set of strategies to achieve different goals was more numerous and variable when the conditions were less conducive for farming. This questions the validity of the prevailing model of extension/communication, based on generalised recommendations for resource-poor farmers in Africa.","Sustainability,Surface runoff,Soil fertility,Resource productivity,Resource allocation,Market liquidity,Land use,Economics,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Population,Pareto principle,Optimization problem,Rainfall runoff,Optimization problem,Mathematics,Soil science,Soil biology,Fertility,Stable distribution,Population,Pareto principle,Soil type,Soil quality,Soil organic matter,Variational Monte Carlo,Quantum Monte Carlo,Physics,Spatial ecology,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Water column,Photodissociation,Oxide,Transect,Soil quality,Soil management,Soil fertility,Relative yield,Optimal allocation","P.A.

In this study, an improved S–W (SWH) model and the MixSIAR model were used for ET partitioning and water source prediction in an irrigated cropland in the North China Plain. Our results indicated that the partition results of SWH model are well consistent with those from micro-lysimeter measurements. T/ET ranged from 13.4% to 87.0% with a mean value of 71.4%, which always exceeded 80% during the peak growing season. Based on δD and δ18O in xylem and soil water, we found that winter wheat derived approximately 78.1 ± 8.9% of its water from the 0–50 cm soil stratum. At the sub-daily time scale, root water uptake from 20 to 50 cm depth mainly occurred during the late afternoon (12:00–18:00 LST). Soil water evaporation was approximately 107.8 mm over the season, 55.8% of which was lost during the filling stage.

564,Exploring Opportunities for Enhancing Innovation in Agriculture: The Case of Oil Palm Production in Ghana,2012-01-01,The Journal of Agricultural Science,10.5539/JAS.V4N10P212,"We carried out a study using key informant interviews, focus group discussions and individual interviews to explore opportunities to enhance innovation in the oil palm sector in Ghana. Current technical innovations at the farm level are insufficient to promote sustainable oil palm production and to alleviate poverty because of overriding institutional constraints at the larger-than-farm level. Oil palm was selected for the study for three main reasons: (1) It is considered a national priority crop because of its potential for reducing poverty, (2) It has a wide geographical coverage and (3) It is considered as both food and cash crop. Oil palm has evolved in the past 40 years from a public-sector to a private-sector crop. The study identified the following main actors in oil palm production: small private farms that produce about 80% of the crop; large-scale industrial estates with their network of smallholder and out-grower farmers who produce to supply their large-scale mechanized processing mills; small-scale semi-mechanized processing mills, medium-scale mechanized mills and secondary processors. Opportunities that will make it rational for farmers to invest in increased production and improved sustainability include: (1) creating institutional conditions that will enable small-scale processors to be integrated into the value chain; (2) organising farmers to be able to negotiate for better deals for themselves; (3) improve system of distribution of improved planting material in regions where accessibility to seedlings of the high-yielding tenera hybrid variety is difficult; and (4) developing new tenancy rules and arrangements that improve the income of tenant farmers and encourage them to invest in increased productivity.","Value chain,Sustainability,Poverty,Negotiation,Leasehold estate,Focus group,Cash crop,Biology,Agronomy,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Vegetable oil,Sustainability,Renewable energy,West africa,Productivity,Poverty,Response surface methodology,Palm oil,Mechanical Processes,Storm,Snow,Population,Water scarcity,Training needs,Self-sufficiency,Waste management,Vegetable oil,Sterilization (microbiology),Poor quality,Palm oil,Oil palm,Screw press,Scarcity,Profitability index,Waste management,Screw press,Pulp and paper industry,West africa,System innovation,Livelihood","S.

As a drought prone area in the Middle East, Iran has currently launched a crisis management approach to mitigate the harmful impacts of drought. However, thus far studies indicate that effective drought management strategies should be designed based upon vulnerability management which can increase farmers' ability to challenge the impacts. The purpose of this study was to assess drought vulnerability across three drought intensities (very high, extremely high, and critical) areas in Western Iran. Accordingly, a survey study was applied and 370 wheat farmers who all experienced drought during 2007–2009 were selected through a multi-stage stratified random sampling method. Face to face interviews were used to collect data on vulnerability indices from the farmers. Me-Bar and Valdez's vulnerability formula was applied to assess the vulnerability of wheat farmers during drought. Results revealed that the farmers' vulnerability is influenced mainly by economic, socio-cultural, psychological, technical, and infrastructural factors. The results also indicated that the farmers in Sarpole-Zahab township were most vulnerable compared to those in the Kermanshah township as the least vulnerable. Accordingly, some conclusions and recommendations are drawn for both policy-makers and practitioners who often must prioritize limited resources in the design vulnerability-reducing interventions.","Vulnerability management,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Stratified sampling,Socioeconomics,Social vulnerability,Geology,Environmental protection,Crisis management,Climatology,Agriculture,Adaptive capacity,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Top-down and bottom-up design,Vulnerability,Social vulnerability,Natural hazard,Political economy of climate change,Natural resource economics,Environmental science,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Focus group,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Terminology,Word error rate,Survey research,Statistics,Vulnerability,Socioeconomics,Social vulnerability,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Social vulnerability,Vulnerability,Stressor,Psychological resilience,Welfare economics,Temptation,Savoring","Kiumars Zarafshani,Lida Sharafi,Hossein Azadi,Gholamhossein Hosseininia,Barry Smit,Johanna Wandel,Benjamin Goodwin Wisner,Piers M.

This coincides with the larger global populations of poultry, pigs, and people and with changing ecological factors. These factors include the redistribution of the human population to cities, rapid mass transportation of people and infectious agents, increased global land use, climate change, and possible changes in viral ecology that perpetuate highly pathogenic influenza viruses in the aquatic bird reservoir. The emergence of H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes of influenza A virus and the increased genetic exchange among influenza viruses in wild aquatic birds, domestic poultry, swine, and humans pose a continuing threat to humanity.

Over the past decade, large numbers of people have emigrated from rural areas as a result of the rapid urbanization in Chinese society. The question then remains: to what extent does this migration affect the regional vegetation greenness in the areas that people have moved from? Based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with a resolution of 1 km, as well as meteorological data and socio-economic data from 2000 to 2010 in Inner Mongolia, the spatio-temporal variation of vegetation greenness in the study area was analyzed via trend analysis and significance test methods. The contributions of human activities and natural factors to the variation of vegetation conditions during this period were also quantitatively tested and verified, using a multi-regression analysis method. We found that: (1) the vegetation greenness of the study area increased by 10.1% during 2000–2010. More than 28% of the vegetation greenness increased significantly, and only about 2% decreased evidently during the study period. (2) The area with significant degradation showed a banded distribution at the northern edge of the agro-pastoral ecotone in central Inner Mongolia. This indicates that the eco-environment is still fragile in this area, which should be paid close attention. The area where vegetation greenness significantly improved showed a concentrated distribution in the southeast and west of Inner Mongolia. (3) The effect of agricultural labor on vegetation greenness exceeded those due to natural factors (i.e. precipitation and temperature). The emigration of agricultural labor improved the regional vegetation greenness significantly.","Vegetation,Urbanization,Trend analysis,Rural area,Precipitation,Physical geography,Normalized Difference Vegetation Index,Hydrology,Geology,Ecotone,Climatology,Agriculture,Vegetation,Sea surface temperature,Rainforest,Vegetation,Tropical vegetation,Soil science,Vegetation types,Vegetation,Precipitation,Vegetation,Surface water,Riparian zone,Vegetation,Trend analysis,Restoration ecology,Weather station,Visibility,Vegetation,Vegetation,Remote sensing,Precipitation,Vegetation cover,Vegetation,Urbanization,Vegetation,Sensor fusion,Remote sensing,Vegetation,Temperate climate,Remote sensing","Shiji Li,Zhigang Sun,Minghong Tan,Xiubin Li,Thomas Hilker,Alexei I.

568,Size and variability of crop productivity both impacted by CO2 enrichment and warming-A case study of 4 year field experiment in a Chinese paddy,2016-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2016.01.028,"Abstract China is a key global region vulnerable to climate change; however, limited studies have focused on the combined impacts of atmospheric CO2 enrichment and warming on crop production in arable land, especially in rice paddies in China. To address this issue, a 4 year open-air field experiment during 2010–2014 was conducted to simulate the impact of climate change on crop production in a rice paddy in southeast of China. Four treatments including the ambient condition (CK), CO2 enrichment (500 ppmv, CE), warming of canopy air (2 °C above the ambient, WA), and the combined CO2 enrichment and warming (CW) were used to investigate the responses of total biomass, crop yield and harvest index. In general, different treatments significantly affected wheat and rice production. Compared to CK, CE significantly increased grain yield of rice by 8%. In contrast, the decreases of 26.2% and 10% in wheat and rice yield were observed under WA. However, there was no significant difference of wheat production between CW and CK, while rice yield and biomass were slightly decreased by a mean of 4.8% and 5.3% over 4 years, indicating the positive effect of CO2 enrichment was unable to compensate for the negative impact of warming. The interannual variations of the responses were also observed in this study. The variation of wheat yields during 4 years was much higher than that of rice yields; however, significant changes in the stability of rice biomass and harvest index were observed under CE and WA. The results indicated both stabilizing and increasing grain yield under climate change are major challenges for agriculture in developing countries.","Paddy field,Field experiment,Crop yield,Climate change,Canopy,Biomass,Biology,Arable land,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agriculture,Match/mismatch,Global warming,Global change,South asia,Natural resource economics,Malnutrition,Radiative forcing,Greenhouse gas,Greenhouse effect,Whole food,Natural resource economics,Malnutrition,Strengths and weaknesses,Natural resource economics,Greenhouse effect,Transpiration,Terrestrial plant,Photosynthetic capacity,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Population,Zea mays,Oryza,Environmental monitoring,Pollen,Panicle,Oryza sativa,Water content,Stomatal conductance,Poaceae","Jianqing Wang,Xiaoyu Liu,Xuhui Zhang,Pete Smith,Lianqing Li,Timothy R.

569,Evaluation of sustainable innovations in olive growing systems: A Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment case study in southern Italy,2018-01-01,Journal of Cleaner Production,10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2017.10.119,"Abstract Innovations are increasingly needed by companies to engage in new market competitiveness. Conscientious consumers are demanding sustainable products and services, and “new qualities” are requested, such as environmental protection, social equitability and economic viability. To satisfy this demand, companies are struggling to find innovative solutions to sustainability concerns. The present paper proposes an innovative and integrated approach, i.e., the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment, a methodology that is still under development within the conceptual framework of Life Cycle Thinking (Klopffer, 2008). Life Cycle Assessment, Life Cycle Costing and social Life Cycle Assessment are integrated here by means of a multicriterial and participative method, the Analytic Hierarchy Process. This case study is about growing Calabrian olives, which is the most important crop in terms of surface area at a regional level. The study focuses on an important agronomic practice, i.e., weeding. The functional unit is 1 ha of cultivated surface, and the system boundary is “from cradle to farm gate”. The time boundary considered here is the expected life of an olive tree corresponding to 50 years. All of the primary data have been gathered through specific in-field surveys with semi-structured questionnaires to farmers and workers. Nine impact categories and quantitative indicators, direct and/or proxy, cover the three primary sustainability dimensions, i.e., environment, economy and society. Three scenarios have been chosen for their relevance to the Calabrian panorama as follows: - a control scenario (CS), which is represented by the conventional and traditional farming system, that commonly recurs according to the use of chemicals for weed and pest control; - a low-dosage/no-tillage (LDNT) scenario, as represented by a reduced use of chemicals; and. - a zero chemical weeding (ZCW) scenario, representing the organic farming system. The results of the multicriterial analysis revealed that the greatest stakeholder concerns are environmental and social sustainability, especially in terms of toxicity and worker health. According to these preferences, low-dosage/no-tillage was the best scenario, with better performance for all of the selected categories except for job opportunities. Holistic sustainability assessments, especially those involving relevant stakeholders, are essential strategies for successfully satisfying and retaining customers, and the present epistemological hybrid proposal to the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment could serve this purpose.","Sustainable products,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Stakeholder,Social sustainability,Life-cycle assessment,Environmental resource management,Economics,Analytic hierarchy process,Agriculture,Weighted product model,Simple prioritization,Rank reversals in decision-making,Theory of measurement,Relative term,Pairwise comparison,Triple bottom line,Transparency (graphic),Sustainability,System model,Database,Computer science,Social psychology,Reciprocity (social psychology),Psychology,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Life-cycle assessment,Ranking,Operations research,Multiple-criteria decision analysis,Sustainable products,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Service quality,Service level requirement,Service level objective,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Social sustainability","Anna Irene De Luca,Giacomo Falcone,Teodora Stillitano,Nathalie Iofrida,Alfio Strano,Giovanni Gulisano,Thomas L.

After starting of groundwater irrigation in Bangladesh, it spread rapidly all over the country, and about 80% of agricultural land is now supplied irrigation from groundwater. Availability of irrigation in Barind Tract has revolutionized its agriculture, but groundwater level is successively falling all over the country due to excessive withdrawal, and this process is accelerating due to water withdrawal from major rivers by upstream countries. In northwestern part of Bangladesh groundwater depletion problem is severe because this part is free from seasonal flooding. Only source of recharging of groundwater aquifer in this area is rainfall, but rainfall is also lowest here among the country. In this context, this paper presents the change of groundwater level with the spreading of groundwater irrigation in Barind Tract. Hydrograph analysis, groundwater level mapping, groundwater depletion rate calculation are done from groundwater level observation well data of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) and Barind Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA). Climatic condition is analyzed by calculation of rainfall deviation from the data of Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD). Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and interviews with farmers and experts of different branches are conducted to understand the nature of problems in the study area. Agricultural pattern, cropping intensity (262% in study area and national intensity is 180%), methods of cultivation, crop variety and yields all show a positive change after starting of groundwater irrigation in mid 1980s, but water level is continuously lowering at the rate of 1.37 ft/y in wet season and 0.72 ft/y in dry season. Water is the main input for agriculture but successive depletion of groundwater level can be a serious problem for water stressed Barind Tract. Crop diversification, artificial recharging, increasing dependency on surface water, increasing irrigation efficiency, rainwater harvesting etc., can be option for the area.","Water level,Surface water,Rainwater harvesting,Irrigation statistics,Irrigation,Hydrology,Groundwater,Geology,Environmental engineering,Agriculture,Agricultural land,Water resources,Structural basin,Irrigation,Water supply,Water resources,Water resource management","Md.

The study has found the trends in fish production and the stakeholders willingness to pay (WTP) for growth and sustainability of traditional and choiced Schizothorax fish species in these lakes. The logit model has been fitted to 8 sets of stakeholders independently while the Tobit model has been used to identify the variables that influenced the WTP of the stakeholders across the two lakes. Both the models have yielded comparable results. Income, time spent on lakes and traders have emerged significant across primary stakeholders and income, education and consumers have emerged significant in the case of secondary stakeholders with expected signs. On the whole, income has emerged as the single most important variable that determined WTP of stakeholders. This study has addressed the issues involved in fish production in Kashmir lakes in the context of decline in fish production, misplaced priorities in terms of species patronage, use priorities and the policy issues involved.","Willingness to pay,Urbanization,Tourism,Tobit model,Sustainability,Fishery,Fish farming,Contingent valuation,Biology,Agriculture,Willingness to pay,Total economic value,Strategic behavior,Willingness to pay,Tourism,Tobit model,Willingness to pay,Pollution,Natural resource economics","Neha W.

Many diverse environmental indicators, including agricultural environmental indicators, are currently in use or being developed. This special collection of technical papers expands on the peer-reviewed literature on environmental indicators and their application to important current issues in the following areas: (i) model-derived indicators to indicate phosphorus losses from arable land to surface runoff and subsurface drainage, (ii) glutathione-ascorbate cycle-related antioxidants as early-warning bioindicators of polybrominated diphenyl ether toxicity in mangroves, and (iii) assessing the effectiveness of using organic matrix biobeds to limit herbicide dissipation from agricultural fields, thereby controlling on-farm point-source pollution. This introductory review also provides an overview of environmental indicators, mainly for agriculture, with examples related to the quality of the agricultural soil-water-air continuum and the application of model-derived indicators. Current knowledge gaps and future lines of investigation are also discussed. It appears that environmental indicators, particularly those for agriculture, work efficiently at the field, catchment, and local scales and serve as valuable metrics of system functioning and response; however, these indicators need to be refined or further developed to comprehensively meet community expectations in terms of providing a consistent picture of relevant issues and/or allowing comparisons to be made nationally or internationally.","Surface runoff,Soil water,Pollution,Environmental resource management,Environmental indicator,Environmental engineering,Chemistry,Bioindicator,Arable land,Air quality index,Agriculture,Water balance,Swat-CUP,Structural basin,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Soil fertility,Tillage,Soil water,Soil science,Spatial ecology,Soil structure,Soil science,Water flow,Vadose zone,Software,Soil science,Soil organic matter,Soil carbon,Water balance,Soil water,Generality,Water quality,Wastewater,Surface runoff,Waterlogging (agriculture),Water pollution,Surface water,Soil organic matter,Organic farming,Manure management","T.

In view of the geo-political complexity, climate-driven changes in water availability are of particular importance in this region. Water shortages during summer will become more frequent as precipitation is expected to further decrease and glacial meltwater releases will decrease in the long-term due to reduced glacier volume. Being the main valve to the entire Syr Darya river system, the Toktogul reservoir in Kyrgyzstan could take over, at least partly, the role of glaciers as seasonal water redistributors, thus allowing the generation of energy in winter – benefiting upstream countries – and irrigation for large-scale agriculture in summer – benefiting downstream countries. To date, however, there is no regional consensus on a balanced reservoir management, which currently favours irrigation according to past Soviet priorities. Moreover, the perception of water as a ‘national concern’ in Central Asia discourages efforts towards cooperation between states at the regional level. So far, climate change adaptation has focused on technical rather than institutional solutions. We suggest that policy-relevant adaptation measures should include consistent data collection and dissemination, cross-sectoral collaboration, promotion of national responsibility and initiative, and agreeing on a regional strategy.","Water resources,Meltwater,Irrigation,Glacier,Environmental protection,Economics,Drainage system (geomorphology),Drainage basin,Climate change,Agriculture,Runaway climate change,Natural resource economics,Environmental engineering,Public administration,Political science,Climate change,Water cycle,Snow hydrology,Snow,Water resources,Water resource management,Structural basin,Sea level,Satellite,Physical geography,Precipitation,Physical geography,Monsoon,Water use,Water supply,Water resources,Surface runoff,Streamflow,Snow,Water resources,Water resource management,Water politics,Watershed,Water resources,Hydrology","Annina Sorg,B.

Due to their toxicity, persistency and wide diffusion, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and their alkylated homologues (Me-PAHs) are among the organic contaminants the most often monitored in the environment. Determination of the contamination level is the crucial first step of environmental research. Field investigations have clearly demonstrated their importance on various studies on the contamination levels, the origin, and impact of contaminants in the aquatic ecosystems. The present paper is an effort on the field studies focusing on persistent organic pollutants: PCBs, PAHs and Me-PAHs, phthalates and pesticides in Somme River water located on Northern France. The sampling zone is characterized by fields of agriculture surrounding urbanized and industrialized areas and constitutes a place embedded with strong fishing activities. However, the river section of interest is also known for the high levels of PCB in sediments.

Policies on land allocation, land tenure and use-rights are important since they potentially promote sustainable mangrove-shrimp management. Forest management policy in Vietnam has been changed to promote equality of benefit sharing among stakeholders and devolved State forest management to the household level. However, to what extent its implementation can stimulate both mangrove conservation and livelihood improvement is still being debated. We use access and its social mechanisms to investigate how State Forest Companies (FC) and farmers can benefit from mangrove exploitation. The study was conducted from September 2008 to August 2010 using both qualitative and quantitative methods and using a participatory approach. After group discussions and in-depth interviews with a wide range of stakeholders, we interviewed 86 households in four communities using structured questionnaires. Results show the imbalance in access to finance, markets, and differences in authority between the two actors, farmers and FC. The discussion focuses on the possibilities of “win–win” outcomes, i.e. land tenure regimes promoting the devolution of sustainable forest management to farm households to balance benefits of both mangrove conservation and livelihood improvement.","Sustainable forest management,State forest,Natural resource management,Mangrove,Livelihood,Land tenure,Forest management,Environmental protection,Economics,Agriculture,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Social influence,Socioeconomics,Rural development,Poverty,Resource management,Natural resource management,Natural resource,Property rights,Policy analysis,Natural resource management,Social identity theory,Situated,Profit (economics),Social learning,Resource management,Natural resource,Sustainable development,Spite,Socioeconomics,Mangrove,Land use,Land management,Shrimp farming,Shrimp culture,Mekong delta,Property rights,Land use,Land tenure","Tran Thi Phung Ha,Han van Dijk,Leontine Visser,Jesse C.

577,Operationalising resilience in farms and rural regions – Findings from fourteen case studies,2017-01-01,Journal of Rural Studies,10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2017.07.008,"The limited resilience of agricultural and food systems, and of rural communities, has become an important concern in rural and agricultural policy. However, while the term has been heavily theorised and discussed, particularly in the natural and environmental sciences, it is sufficiently ambiguous to support divergent and even contradictory policy goals and farmers' strategies. This paper focuses on the more encompassing notion of social-ecological resilience and contends that among the causes of this divergence are the disparate spatial and temporal scales used to assess and plan enhancing resilience. Based on empirical evidence, we show that strategies that may increase farmers' abilities to persist in a difficult economic environment may undermine the resilience of the wider region, while decisions that enhance farmers’ resilience in the short term may lock them onto a path that weakens their future resilience. Using case studies from 14 different countries across Europe and beyond, we address two main questions. Firstly, how the notion of resilience is being operationalised at a farm or regional level. That is to say, what are the different strategies that farmers, rural residents and other decision-makers in rural areas are using to enhance resilience? Secondly, we look at how the outcomes of implementing these strategies vary according to spatial and temporal factors.","Temporal scales,Rural area,Psychological resilience,Food systems,Environmental resource management,Empirical evidence,Economics,Agriculture,Agricultural policy,Adaptability,Socio-ecological system,Regime shift,Psychological resilience,Socio-ecological system,Social system,Social ecology,Transformational leadership,Socio-ecological system,Psychological resilience,Urban studies,Urban resilience,Sociology,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Socio-ecological system,Socio-ecological system,Social learning,Psychological resilience,Sociology,Socio-ecological system,Social science,Psychological resilience,Monoculture,Incentive,Sociology,Socio-ecological system,Social theory,Socio-ecological system,Psychological resilience,Perception","Amit Ashkenazy,Tzruya Calvão Chebach,Karlheinz Knickel,Sarah Peter,Boaz Horowitz,Rivka Offenbach,Brian Walker,C.

578,"Invited review: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, agriculture, and food-A case of shifting cultivation and history.",2019-01-01,Global Change Biology,10.1111/GCB.14700,": Since 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has produced five Assessment Reports (ARs), in which agriculture as the production of food for humans via crops and livestock have featured in one form or another. A constructed database of the ca. 2,100 cited experiments and simulations in the five ARs was analyzed with respect to impacts on yields via crop type, region, and whether adaptation was included. Quantitative data on impacts and adaptation in livestock farming have been extremely scarce in the ARs. The main conclusions from impact and adaptation are that crop yields will decline, but that responses have large statistical variation. Mitigation assessments in the ARs have used both bottom-up and top-down methods but need better to link emissions and their mitigation with food production and security. Relevant policy options have become broader in later ARs and included more of the social and nonproduction aspects of food security. Our overall conclusion is that agriculture and food security, which are two of the most central, critical, and imminent issues in climate change, have been dealt with an unfocussed and inconsistent manner between the IPCC five ARs. This is partly a result of not only agriculture spanning two IPCC working groups but also the very strong focus on projections from computer crop simulation modeling. For the future, we suggest a need to examine interactions between themes such as crop resource use efficiencies and to include all production and nonproduction aspects of food security in future roles for integrated assessment models.","Working group,Shifting cultivation,Natural resource economics,Livestock,Global and Planetary Change,Food security,Food processing,Ecology,Climate change,Biology,Agriculture,Urbanization,Sustainability,Public health,Tropics,Representative Concentration Pathways,Food security,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Good agricultural practice,Food systems,Potential impact,Natural resource economics,Food supply,Simulation modeling,Radiative forcing,Natural resource economics,Poaceae,Photosynthetic capacity,Phenology,Statistics,Simulation modeling,Ranking,Vulnerability,Stakeholder,Predictability,Research management,Environmental protection,Economics,Transformational leadership,Stern,Politics","John R.

The Case of Market-Gardening in Southeastern France,2009-01-01,Journal of Sustainable Agriculture,10.1080/10440040902997785,"Organic market-gardening farming systems are extremely diverse, ranging from the extensive to the very intensive, although all follow organic standards. This study aimed to analyze the extent to which the diversity of farming systems in southeastern France may be explained by the marketing channels adopted by growers. Eighteen organic market gardeners were surveyed. Three types of growers were identified, differentiated by the way they combine farming and marketing systems: (1) growers selling a diversity of food products through local marketing channels, which allows them to increase plant species biodiversity and enhance natural regulations in accordance with agro-ecology principles; (2) specialized growers selling a limited number of food products through long marketing channels at the few periods most economically favorable with regard to the export-market, a questionable strategy in terms of environmental sustainability; and (3) intermediate growers combining short and long marketing channels, who po...","Sustainability,Plant species,Organic horticulture,Organic farming,Marketing channel,Market garden,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Valuation (finance),Sociology,Food systems,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Sociology,Social science,Humanities,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Organic farming,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Natural resource economics,Managerialism,Integrated management,Disease control,Chemical control,Sustainable management,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Tropics,Tropical rain forest,Rainforest,Sustainable agriculture,Soil solarization,PEST analysis","Mireille Navarrete,Miguel A.

581,Challenges for crop production and management from pathogen biodiversity and diseases under current and future climate scenarios – Case study with oilseed Brassicas,2012-01-01,Field Crops Research,10.1016/J.FCR.2011.11.021,"Abstract Climate change not only influences agricultural and horticultural crops but also the diseases that affect them. The different parameters associated with climate change, such as warmer temperatures, increased levels of CO2, decreased rainfall and increased rainfall variability, have been widely studied in terms of their influence on different aspects of pathogens and diseases across various crops. This includes pathogen life cycle, expression of host resistance, disease epidemiology and severity of disease epidemics, as well as pathogen inoculum production. Less well studied are the potential changes in pathogen biodiversity, such as development of races or pathotypes, in response to climate change. Future changes in both pathogen diversity and pathogen threats are built on the complex changes in crops and agricultural practices that can occur with or without climate change. Pathogens are successful opportunists that occupy any niche that is not adequately protected by crop protection strategies, including host resistance. Climate change will influence future changes in the distribution and the challenge of future pathogen threats and corresponding changes in pathogen diversity. Fungal and oomycete pathogens occurring on oilseed Brassicas provide strong indications of the abilities of pathogens to readily adapt to changes in climate, including changes in crops or cropping systems in response to future climate scenarios. Some existing climates, such as Mediterranean climates and regions, are historically highly variable in terms of environmental parameters, including the amount, timing and variability of temperature and rainfall. These environments offer significant prospects for gaining a better insight and understanding of the processes involved with pathogen adaptation to future climate scenarios. While there have been attempts to date to define future expansion or contractions of some particular diseases in relation to future climate scenarios, including some diseases occurring on oilseed Brassicas, defining future distribution ranges of the most important pathogens, their races, and consequent disease challenges in relation to future climate changes remains an area of high priority. This information is critical for monitoring such changes over time and also for designing pre-emptive management strategies against pathogen threats for crops under future climate scenarios. Surprisingly, relatively little has been defined in terms of traits such as increased frequency of drought, higher temperatures, unpredictable and erratic wetting and drying cycles, salinity and inundation events in terms of the genes that determine differences in tolerance to such traits. Oilseed Brassicas include a range of different species making them an ideal prospect for use as a ‘model’ plant grouping for investigating and modelling impacts of biotic and abiotic stresses and their interactions under future climate scenarios. As a first step, the anticipated shifts in biotic and abiotic stress thresholds that occur across current environments for established and new Brassica crop species as a result of climate change could be defined. This includes how predicted future abiotic stresses could not only pre-dispose some species to more severe disease infections but also how they alter both pathogen diversity and expression of host resistances to diseases. Subsequently, the potential impacts of changing Brassica crop species on other components of cropping systems across different countries representing different current and future climate scenarios could be defined. Using oilseed Brassicas as model species will not only define the potential hazards involved in simply shifting crop species initially to overcome abiotic limitations imposed by climate change, but will actually define the basis for capturing the benefits and opportunities these alternative Brassica species offer as a means of coping with climate change. In this way, oilseed Brassicas could be utilized to define pre-emptive management strategies, such as by breeding for better and/more appropriate types and levels of host resistance to pathogens and deploying host resistances in better and more controlled ways to maximize the longevity of such host resistance in the face of changing pathogen pathotypes. This review will utilize the outcomes of studies in relation to pathogens, particularly pathogen biodiversity, and diseases of oilseed Brassicas over past decades as a basis for outlining the challenges, opportunities and priorities for improving on current management successes such that crop yields can be maintained in the face of expected pathogen threats likely to occur under future climate scenarios.","Mediterranean climate,Ecology,Cropping,Crop protection,Climate change,Botany,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agriculture,Abiotic stress,Abiotic component,Stern Review,Stern,Political economy of climate change,Strengths and weaknesses,Natural resource economics,Greenhouse effect,Stomatal conductance,Specific leaf area,RuBisCO,Sustainable development,Glossary,Geography,Plant disease resistance,Plant disease,Plant breeding,Public health,Ecology,Disease,Population,Plant disease,Head blight,Vulnerability,Typology,Risk management,Plant disease,Greenhouse effect,Global warming,Tillage,Temperate climate,Global warming","Martin J.

The introduction of this technology in remote rural areas of Sri Lanka is combined with the provision of microloans which allow potential users to finance these systems. An explorative empirical survey was conducted in Monaragala, one of the poorest districts of Sri Lanka, analysing the contribution of the implementation of SHS towards poverty reduction. The survey is based on qualitative interviews with 40 users of SHS and expert interviews with the main implementation actors in this field (e.g. the financing institution, developing engineers). The majority of the interviewed users highlighted improved quality of life due to the availability of electricity, but also expressed discontent with the limited capacity of SHS and frequent functionality issues. Depending on their economic situations, different types of households vary in their capabilities to react to these limitations. Especially poor SHS users do not have the financial resources to replace inoperable equipment during the period of loan repayment. Access to electricity via SHS has not necessarily led to better productivity in agriculture or other productive sectors. The study concludes that robust technologies, adequate maintenance and financing strategies as well as embedding provision of energy supply in broader regional development strategies are necessary if implementation of SHS is going to effectively contribute towards poverty reduction in remote rural areas.","Waste management,Sri lanka,Rural area,Poverty reduction,Microfinance,Limited capacity,Environmental economics,Energy supply,Electricity,Economics,Economic growth,Agriculture,Zinc,Potassium-ion battery,Organic radical battery,Quality of life,Labour economics,Economics,Social Welfare,Poverty,Political science,Tax credit,Subsidy,Rural electrification,Well-being,Public economics,Poverty,Transparency (graphic),Rural poverty,Public economics,Rural electrification,Private sector involvement,Poverty,Sociology,Knowledge management,Engineering ethics,Sociology,Social science,Semi-structured interview,Rural electrification,Rural area,Primary energy","Dino Laufer,Martina Schäfer,David Linden,Robert Sugden,Martha Nussbaum,Amartya Sen,Jeffrey D.

This study, based on an analysis of experience from the state of Andhra Pradesh, addresses the potential of the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) to contribute to systemic corrections in present paddy cultivation, both with regard to agronomic productivity and irrigation water use efficiency. This study points to the considerable increase in rice productivity and farmer incomes, which is being achieved in Andhra Pradesh with substantial reduction in irrigation water application, labor, and seed costs through utilization of SRI methods. Potential public savings on water and power costs could be drawn upon not only for promoting SRI but also to effect systemic corrections in the irrigation sector, to mutual advantage.","Water use,Water resource management,Water conservation,System of Rice Intensification,Irrigation management,Irrigation,Farm water,Economics,Deficit irrigation,Agronomy,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,System of Rice Intensification,Sustainable agriculture,Rural area,Weed control,Tropics,System of Rice Intensification,Water resource management,Tamil,System of Rice Intensification,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Water resources,Business,Astrobiology,Profitability index,Horticultural crops,Geography","Ravindra Adusumilli,S.

586,Landscape properties as drivers for farm diversification: A Dutch case study,2009-01-01,Land Use Policy,10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2009.01.007,"Abstract Farm diversification is stimulated by the societal demand to transform production countryside into consumption countryside. In most empirical studies on farmers’ decision making for diversification, geographical information is either omitted or reduced to a variable that links the farm to an administrative unit. Therefore, the influence of the exact farm location on farmers’ decision making is often lacking. The paper addresses the role of location, in terms of site specific natural conditions as well as neighboring dynamics, in influencing farmers’ decision making to diversify. Moreover, it investigates to what extend low returns from primary production stimulate farmers to find new survival strategies, and therefore explains diversification. The Gelderse Vallei area, a region in the center of the Netherlands, is used as a case study. For this area an extensive farm survey data could be combined with topographic data and soil maps (GIS). Both the number of activities as well as the kind of activities that are taken up are analyzed. Landscape attractiveness turns out to be a driver of diversification. Daily recreation most frequently occurs close to national parks, green services are more likely to occur on relatively wet soils. Activities resulting from diversification might produce positive externalities: new activities have the tendency to emerge next to already existing ones, therewith explaining the formation of “hotspots” in the landscape. Finally, diversification was found to be sensitive to returns from primary agriculture production.","Survey data collection,Recreation,Multivariate probit model,Location theory,Externality,Economics,Diversification (marketing strategy),Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Agricultural diversification,Sampling (statistics),Population,Panel data,Probit,Mixed logit,Logit,Statistics,Newey–West estimator,Minimum-variance unbiased estimator,Regression analysis,Quantile,Panel data,Soil science,Soil quality index,Soil quality,Sustainable environment,Soil quality index,Soil quality,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Rural sociology,Rural area,Upper and lower bounds,Statistics,Probit model,Turnover,Survey data collection,Public economics,Spatial ecology,Simple random sample,Landscape ecology","Catherine Pfeifer,Roel A.

589,Appropriate exposure estimates for wildlife risk assessments of crop protection products based on continuous radio telemetry: A case study with woodpigeons.,2017-01-01,Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,10.1002/ETC.3656,"The registration of pesticides follows guidance published by the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA. As a default, the EFSA guidance document on risk assessment for birds and mammals assumes that animals feed exclusively on pesticide-treated fields. However, the guidance document suggests refining the risk via the proportion of food animals obtain from a treated field or specific crop (expressed via the so-called PT value). The EFSA guidance equalizes the portion of food taken from a treated area per day with the portion of time spent potentially foraging over the course of a day within this area. Therefore, radio-tracking is commonly used to gather species-, crop-, and season-specific PT data, and radio telemetry of continuously tracked farmland species can deliver individual PT values for a given day, crop and species. In the present study the authors introduce a way of calculating long-term PT values based on empirically recorded data via telemetry field studies for the most appropriate use in wildlife risk assessment of pesticides. The novel aspect of the proposal is that the authors follow the prerequisite given by EFSA to cover the long-term risk by introducing 21-d PT values which aim to cover both intra- and inter-individual variability of foraging focal farmland species in cropped habitats. Currently, the intra-individual variability is not taken into account for PT calculations. The authors demonstrate this approach and discuss EFSA guidance input requirements for PT values recorded in field studies, based on a ‘PT field study’ conducted with Woodpigeons (Columba palumbus) radio-tracked in an agricultural landscape in the UK. The results indicate that a 21-day PT value considering intra-individual variability gives a more appropriate PT value for long-term risk assessments. This article is protected by copyright.

The agropastoral system involved an array of crops and herd animals. In this article, we present a paleoethnobotanical study conducted on sediment samples from excavation units at the site of Adji Kui 1, Turkmenistan. Excavations at the site were conducted in 2013; the site is located on the northeastern part of the Murghab Alluvial Fan in the Kara Kum Desert. Earlier excavations at the site have shown that its occupation spanned from 2400 to 1300 BCE. The botanical remains recovered from the site illustrate that a very different landscape existed around the site in the past and that the economy was heavily reliant on farming of several different crops, as well as wild resources. In this paper, we present macrobotanical remains of wild foraged plants, such as fruits and nuts. We show that in addition to meat and dairy products, people at the site fished for small stream fish. We also present evidence for an array of cultivated grains and legumes; among the grains we identified hulled and naked barley, broomcorn millet, and free-threshing wheat; we also identified peas, lentils, grass peas, bitter vetch, and fava bean. Ultimately, we attempt to lay out part of the early stages of development of a Central Asian cuisine.","Pastoralism,Paleoethnobotany,Geography,Fishing,Excavation,Economy,Crop,Bronze Age,Archaeology,Alluvial fan,Agriculture,Plateau,Pastoralism,Paleoethnobotany,Subsistence agriculture,Prehistory,Pastoralism,Weed,Setaria,Panicum miliaceum,Strengths and weaknesses,Sophistication,Paleoethnobotany,Subsistence agriculture,Steppe,Pastoralism,Panicum miliaceum,History,Domestication,Subsistence agriculture,Steppe,Pastoralism,Pastoralism,Mudbrick,Geology,Vicia faba,Pre-Pottery Neolithic,North west,Subsistence economy,Subsistence agriculture,Steppe","Robert N.

594,Inputs of Nutrients and Fecal Bacteria to Freshwaters from Irrigated Agriculture: Case Studies in Australia and New Zealand,2011-01-01,Environmental Management,10.1007/S00267-011-9644-1,"Increasing demand for global food production is leading to greater use of irrigation to supplement rainfall and enable more intensive use of land. Minimizing adverse impacts of this intensification on surface water and groundwater resources is of critical importance for the achievement of sustainable land use. In this paper we examine the linkages between irrigation runoff and resulting changes in quality of receiving surface waters and groundwaters in Australia and New Zealand. Case studies are used to illustrate impacts under different irrigation techniques (notably flood and sprinkler systems) and land uses, particularly where irrigation has led to intensification of land use. For flood irrigation, changes in surface water contaminant concentrations are directly influenced by the amount of runoff, and the intensity and kind of land use. Mitigation for flood irrigation is best achieved by optimizing irrigation efficiency. For sprinkler irrigation, leaching to groundwater is the main transport path for contaminants, notably nitrate. Mitigation measures for sprinkler irrigation should take into account irrigation efficiency and the proximity of intensive land uses to sensitive waters. Relating contaminant concentrations in receiving groundwaters to their dominant causes is often complicated by uncertainty about the subsurface flow paths and the possible pollutant sources, viz. drainage from irrigated land. This highlights the need for identification of the patterns and dynamics of surface and subsurface waters to identify such sources of contaminants and minimize their impacts on the receiving environments.","Water resource management,Water conservation,Surface irrigation,Low-flow irrigation systems,Irrigation statistics,Irrigation management,Intensive farming,Hydrology (agriculture),Economics,Deficit irrigation,World map,Water resources,Regionalisation,World map,Humanities,Global precipitation,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource,Terrestrial ecosystem,Marine ecosystem,Eutrophication,Water consumption,Water balance,Performance indicator,Soil horizon,Plough,Pasture,Water resources,Water conservation,Irrigation water,Toxicity,Salinity,Nitrate,Ultisol,Surface runoff,Soil water,Watershed,Water resource management,Water quality","Robert J.

In 2003 bushfires devastated the small population of this isolated farming district, destroying homes, agricultural assets and public infrastructure. The fires also adversely affected the health, livelihoods and social lives of many local people. The paper examines: (i) how and why people were exposed to hazards during the bushfires; and (ii) how and why people were differentially capable of coping and adapting to the fires' impacts. Qualitative methods were primarily used to investigate these questions, including semi-structured interviews with residents and landholders of the district and others who responded to the fires in an official or unofficial capacity. Vulnerability is shown to arise from the circumstances of people's everyday lives, which are shaped by factors both within and beyond their control. Local pressures and challenges – such as drought, declining farm incomes, depopulation, and the inaccessibility of essential services – are shown to increase people's exposure to hazards and reduce their capacities to cope and adapt. The paper demonstrates the fundamental importance of sustainable livelihoods and regional economic vitality to the long-term goal of vulnerability reduction.","Vulnerability,Vitality,Socioeconomics,Rural area,Public infrastructure,Population,Natural disaster,Livelihood,Economics,Agriculture,Raw data,Qualitative reasoning,Qualitative property,Socio-ecological system,Social network,Social learning,Vulnerability,Social vulnerability,Natural hazard,Research question,Research data,Qualitative research,Research findings,Natural hazard,Hazard mitigation,Software,Social media,Research questions,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Social ecology,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Social vulnerability,Vulnerability,Sociology,Social vulnerability,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Social vulnerability","Joshua Whittaker,John Handmer,David Mercer,David R.

597,Effects of the Renewable Energy Act on structural change in Agriculture- The case of biogas,2014-01-01,EconStor Open Access Articles,10.22004/AG.ECON.210956,"The strong political support for biogas production in Germany over the past decade has greatly affected agricultural production, farms and land markets. This paper analyzes the effects of Germany's biogas policies on agricultural development by using the agent-based simulation model AgriPoliS. Particular focus is placed on the effects of the previous German Renewable Energy Act (REA, German “EEG”) of 2012, as well as the latest amendments, which were added in 2014. Our results show that under the previous REA and its predecessors, biogas production provided an attractive investment opportunity, especially for large farms, which led to a boost in biogas production. However, this policy also caused distortions within the agricultural sector, including increasing land rental prices. These effects particularly threatened farms that were not able to invest in biogas, as well as smaller biogas farms. On average, biogas farms could not increase their profitability. The main reason for this effect can be seen in the fact that a significant share of the value added is transferred via increased rental prices to land owners. The amendment of the REA in 2014, which reduced support levels substantially, partly attenuates some of these effects, though the previous policy will cast a long shadow.","Renting,Renewable energy,Profitability index,Economics,Biogas production,Biogas,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural economics,Agricultural development,Technical change,Simulation modeling,Minor (value),Structural adjustment,Standard of living,Natural resource economics,Structural change,Structural adjustment,Policy analysis,Renting,Renewable energy law,Energy crop,Welfare economics,Spatial econometrics,Rural development","Franziska Appel,Arlette Ostermeyer-Wiethaup,Alfons Balmann,Kathrin Happe,Konrad Kellermann,Alfons Balmann,Kathrin Happe,Kathrin Happe,Alfons Balmann,Konrad Kellermann,Christoph Sahrbacher,Hendrik Habermann,Gunnar Breustedt,Silke Huettel,Martin Odening,Karin Kataria,Alfons Balmann",https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/210956,9,agriculture case study greenhouse gas

The proposed methodology was applied in Greece, where flash floods are a relatively frequent phenomenon and it has become more intense over the last decades, causing significant damages in rural and urban sectors. In order the most prone flooding areas to be identified, seven factor-maps (that are directly related to flood generation) were combined in a GIS environment. These factor-maps are: a) the Flow accumulation (F), b) the Land use (L), c) the Altitude (A), b) the Slope (S), e) the soil Erodibility (E), f) the Rainfall intensity (R), and g) the available water Capacity (C). The name to the proposed method is “FLASERC”. The flood hazard for each one of these factors is classified into five categories: Very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The above factors are combined and processed using the appropriate ANN algorithm tool. For the ANN training process spatial distribution of historical flooded points in Greece within the five different flood hazard categories of the aforementioned seven factor-maps were combined. In this way, the overall flood hazard map for Greece was determined. The final results are verified using additional historical flood events that have occurred in Greece over the last 100 years. In addition, an overview of flood protection measures and adaptation policy approaches were proposed for agricultural and urban areas located at very high flood hazard areas.","Land use,Flooding (psychology),Flood myth,Flash flood,Environmental engineering,Chemistry,Available water capacity,Altitude,Agriculture,100-year flood,Wetland,Water extraction,Surface water,Water resources,Network geometry,Network architecture,Spatial variability,Spatial dependence,Multivariate interpolation,WEPP,Vegetation,Soil retrogression and degradation,Southeast asia,Socioeconomic development,River flood,Thematic map,Surface runoff,Natural hazard,Rain gauge,Preliminary analysis,Observatory,Statistics,Robustness (computer science),Land use,Terrain,Return period,Poison control,Theoretical computer science,Serial computer,Neuromorphic engineering","Nektarios N.

Based on survey data collected in Georgia in 2013, this paper investigates determinants of the environmental horticulture firms’ recycling decision (plastic containers, flats, and greenhouse poly). Our findings indicate that the decision to discard vs. recycle plastic containers, flats, and greenhouse poly is significantly influenced by firm scope, size, location, and partnership with recycling providers, as well as whether recycling providers offer additional waste pickup services.

Using data from a sample of Italian horticultural farms, we explored the multiple forces driving farm succession in a high value added sector. In addition to the traditional factors examined in the literature (farm, farmer and family features), we treated the farm transfer choice as the complement of the decision to migrate out of the agricultural sector, testing the effects of local labour market conditions (employment, income gap between farm and non-farm sector) and population density around the farm, as a proxy of rural-urban interface relationships. It has been shown that both traditional factors and territorial and labour market conditions influence the probability of farm succession. Interestingly labour market conditions exerted an effect in line with occupational choice theory only in less inhabited areas; in more densely populated regions a rural-urban linkage effect seems to prevail, creating an environment that fosters succession of young horticultural farmers. Peri-urban areas may thus be a favourable location for professional and specialised horticultural farms, as well as multifunctional and de-specialised ones, if their assets are properly protected against farmland subtraction. More generally, these findings confirm the validity of a more comprehensive approach toward farm succession, which takes occupational choice theory and rural-urban farm adaptation strategies into account.","Rational choice theory,Peri-urban agriculture,Market conditions,Landscape maintenance,Environmental protection,Economics,Ecological succession,Agriculture,Adaptation strategies,Systems engineering,Quality of analytical results,Quality management system,Statistics,Statistical hypothesis testing,Regression analysis,Natural resource economics,Land use,European union,Urban agriculture,Urban agglomeration,Peri-urban agriculture,Urbanization,Urban area,Unemployment,Western europe,Subsidy,Relative price,Transaction cost,Successor cardinal,Family farm,Volume growth,Supply chain,Success factors,Rural area,Regional science,Public policy,Urban sprawl,Urban area,Urban agriculture","Danilo Bertoni,Daniele Cavicchioli,Barrie Dale,J.

As parts of agricultural product supply chains, land use (LU) and land use change (LUC) are considered to be major contributors to global CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, LU and LUC (LULUC) are rarely included in GHG estimations for food and feedstuffs. Here we propose a method which can be used to derive emissions from LU and LUC on a regional level. Emissions are distributed over an accounting period chosen to match the physically occurring carbon fluxes. As fluxes from soil organic carbon persist for years or even for decades after a LUC episode, depending on the climatic conditions of the region, we apply 10 and 20 years as suitable accounting periods for tropical and temperate climate zones, respectively. We compare the proposed method with two other methods proposed in the literature. Using two types of feedstuffs (Brazilian soybean-meal and Austrian barley) as examples, we find that the other two methods produce mostly lower emission estimates in the case of Brazilian soybeans, and higher estimates for Austrian barley. We conclude that these differences are caused mainly by different accounting periods and by a (non)consideration of regional specificities. While analysing life cycles necessarily entails a well supported – but still arbitrary – setting of such system boundaries, we argue that the methodology presented here better reflects actually occurring carbon fluxes that we understand to be the foundation of any environmental product assessment.","Temperate climate,Supply chain,Soil carbon,Natural resource economics,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Greenhouse gas,Environmental resource management,Environmental engineering,Economics,Agriculture,Accounting period,Runaway climate change,Physical science,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report,Second-generation biofuels,Low-carbon fuel standard,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Sustainable biofuel,Renewable fuels,Low-carbon fuel standard,Trace gas,Greenhouse gas,Environmental science,Tropical climate,Pasture,Land use,Toxicology,Monogastric,Livestock,Oceanography,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land cover,Tropics,Pasture,Land use,Waste management,Soil quality,Natural resource,Renewable energy,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Greenhouse gas","Stefan Hörtenhuber,Gerhard Piringer,Werner Zollitsch,Thomas Lindenthal,Jonathan Gregory,Ronald J.

The mining and other industries that are taking over the resources of the ecosystems of these tribal people and poor peasants fail to provide them with an improved and sustainable means of making a living.

Since the past few years, we have been carrying out several studies on nitrate source, transformation and transfer of both surface and groundwaters in relation with land use and agriculture practices in order to assess nitrate (NO3-) leaching, contamination of aquifers, denitrification processes and associated nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. A synthesis of these studies is presented to establish a quantitative diagnosis of nitrate contamination and N2O emissions at the watershed scale. Taking this watershed as a practical example, we compare curative management measures, such as pond introduction, and preventive measures, namely conversion to organic farming practices, using model simulations. It is concluded that only preventive measures are able to reduce the NO3- contamination level without further increasing N2O emissions, a result providing new insights for future management bringing together water-agro-ecosystems.

It finds that interventionist policies to fast-track the development of high-value supply chains have perverse outcomes and that a more incremental and facilitative approach to modernisation should be pursued based around the development of mid-value supply chains.","Supply chain,Rural development,Modernization theory,Market economy,Food safety,Economics,China,Beef industry,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Agribusiness,Subsistence agriculture,Rural sociology,Rural poverty,Per capita,Globalization,Food systems,Supply chain,Procurement,Government,Technical change,Rapid rise,Productivity,Willingness to pay,Quality management system,Price premium,Urbanization,Urban economics,Tobit model,Supply chain,Socioeconomics,Purchasing,Means of production,Land law,Economics,Microeconomics,Income elasticity of demand,Food market,Transaction cost,Threatened species,Profit efficiency","Scott Waldron,Colin Brown,John Longworth,Robert Townsend,Elisabeth Sadoulet,Alain De Janvry,Derek Byerlee,Irina Klytchnikova,Prabhu L.

612,An Experimental Investigation of Hard and Soft Price Ceilings in Emissions Permit Markets,2016-01-01,Environmental and Resource Economics,10.1007/S10640-014-9810-Z,"Abstract Tradable emissions permits have been implemented to control pollution levels in various markets and represent a major component of legislative efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions. Because permits are supplied for a fixed level of pollution, allowing the market for permits to determine the price, price control mechanisms may be needed to protect firms from price spikes caused by fluctuations in the demand for permits. We test permit markets in an experimental laboratory setting to determine the effectiveness of several price control mechanisms, with special attention on the soft price ceiling. We focus on a static setting similar to some of the earliest experimental work focused on price ceilings. Results indicate that both permit supply adjustments and price ceilings (hard ceilings) effectively limit elevated prices in this setting. By contrast, reserve auctions to implement soft ceilings do not consistently control prices, especially when a minimum reserve permit price is applied. Furthermore, the grandfathering of permits allows permit sellers to realize significant welfare gains at the expense of buyers under a soft ceiling policy. Our results thus highlight several advantages of hard ceilings for controlling short term price increases.","Welfare,Price mechanism,Price controls,Price ceiling,Microeconomics,Limit price,Greenhouse gas,Experimental economics,Economics,Common value auction,Welfare economics,Toolbox,Software engineering,Price ceiling,Microeconomics,Greenhouse gas,Volatility (finance),Unintended consequences,Safety valve,Stochastic programming,Price ceiling,Microeconomics,Safety valve,Microeconomics,Interest rate,Spatial design,International economics,Industrial organization,Windfall gain,Spot market,Pollution,Reverse auction,Revenue equivalence,Microeconomics,Trade barrier,Microeconomics,Market price,Regulatory authority,Price of stability,Microeconomics","David F.

The objective of this study was to evaluate, by selecting organic and conventional sweet cherry orchards located in/or close to Natura 2000 sites (a) the energy flow between the two farming systems and (b) the effect of farming system to gas emissions (CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O). Twenty farms [(2-conventional and 2-organic) × 5-locations] were selected during 2003–2004. Means averaged over all locations for insecticides and fungicides application, fuel, insecticides, fungicides, non-renewable energy inputs, energy shoot outputs, energy fruit outputs, energy shoot + fruit outputs, fruit production, shoot efficiency, fruit efficiency, shoot + fruit efficiency, non-renewable energy efficiency, gas emissions were higher in conventional than in organic orchards, while fertilizer application, harvesting, fertilizers, labor, total energy inputs, renewable energy inputs, intensity and non-renewable energy consumption were higher in organic orchards. Means averaged over two farming systems for fertilizer, insecticide and fungicide application were higher in GRL2 and GRL5. The means averaged over two systems for transportation had the highest value in GRL4 and the lowest in GRL5. Finally, means averaged over two farming systems for labor had the highest value in GRL2. Non-renewable energy inputs as percent of total inputs were 82.63 and 52.42% in conventional and organic sweet cherry orchards respectively. The results show that organic farming systems could reduce non-renewable energy inputs and gas emissions in an efficient way in areas related to Natura 2000 sites.","Renewable energy,Organic farming,Orchard,Fertilizer,European union,Energy consumption,Efficient energy use,Chemistry,Agronomy,Agroecology,Phenology,Global warming,Global change,Meteorology,Greenhouse gas,Global warming,Manure management,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Threatened species,Species distribution,Mediterranean climate,Mutualism (biology),Global warming,Global change,Sustainability,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Population,Organic farming,Food systems,Soil organic matter,Organic farming,No-till farming,Greenhouse gas,Greenhouse effect,Global warming,Economy,Business","Vassilios D.

614,Greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield in no-tillage systems: A meta-analysis,2018-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2018.09.002,"Abstract No-tillage (NT) has been touted as one of several climate-smart agriculture (CSA) management practices that improve food security and enhance agroecosystem resilience to climate change. However, the sustainable effectiveness of NT greatly depends on trade-offs between NT-induced changes in crop yield and greenhouse gas (GHG, i.e. CH4, CO2, and N2O) emissions. Such trade-offs are regulated by climate fluctuations and heterogeneous soil conditions and have not been well addressed. Supporting CSA management decisions requires advancing our understanding of how NT affects crop yield and GHG emissions in different agroecological regions. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted using 740 paired measurements from 90 peer-reviewed articles to assess the effects of NT on crop yield, GHG emissions, and the global warming potential (GWP) of major cereal cropping systems. Compared to conventional tillage (CT), NT reduced in GHG emissions and increased crop yield in dry, but not humid, climates, and reduced in the GWP at sites with acidic soils. Across different cropping systems, NT enhanced barley yield by 49%, particularly in dry climates, and it decreased the GWP of rice fields through a 22% reduction in both CO2 and CH4 emissions. Our synthesis suggests that NT is an effective CSA management practice because of its potential for climate change mitigation and crop yield improvement. However, the net effect of NT (relative to CT) was influenced by several environmental and agronomic factors (climatic conditions, tillage duration, soil texture, pH, crop species). Therefore, agroecological setting must be taken into consideration when conducting a comparative evaluation of different tillage practices.","Tillage,Soil texture,Greenhouse gas,Crop yield,Conventional tillage,Climate change mitigation,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture","Yawen Huang,Wei Ren,Lixin Wang,Dafeng Hui,John H.

Some argue that intensive, specialized systems are more efficient and emit fewer pollutants; others claim that integrated, diversified farming systems are more beneficial to both society and the environment. Bio-economic farm models can help decision-makers and researchers analyze the trade-offs among the numerous possibilities, and direct future livestock production toward greater sustainability. The Orfee model described and evaluated here was developed with this aim. It covers a broad range of beef and dairy systems and forage and crop production alternatives that may be managed with varying levels of intensity (breed, production objective, crop operations, etc.) and integration (crop rotation, organic fertilization, calving period, animal diets, etc.).

616,A diachronic study of greenhouse gas emissions of French dairy farms according to adaptation pathways,2016-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2016.01.027,"Abstract Mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of dairy farms may conflict with farmers’ needs to adapt to complex, dynamic and interrelated changes in production. We performed a diachronic study that considers change in GHG emissions at the farm level following implementation of adaptations by dairy farmers. We hypothesized (i) that farm adaptations follow three pathways discussed in the scientific literature: specialization and intensification, eco-efficient intensification, agroecological transition, and (ii) that these three adaptation pathways drive the evolution of GHG emissions of dairy farms, particularly by determining farms’ reliance on purchased nitrogen (N) fertilizers and N-rich concentrates. We identified 10 dairy farms in the Aveyron department, France, that capture the diversity of local farming systems on a gradient of intensified land use, dairy herd, or both. We considered two situations for each farm: (i) the current situation and (ii) a former situation, at most 10 years before, suggested by the farmer during the survey and different from the current situation. We estimated product-related (per kg of milk) and area-related (per ha) GHG emissions for each farm with a farm model that includes a GHG emission calculator consistent with the International Panel on Climate Change methodology. Two farms followed the trend of specialization and intensification by increasing their stocking rate and maintaining or increasing their milk production per unit of area and livestock while simplifying and standardizing farm management, such as feeding cows with larger amounts of maize silage and N-rich concentrates. Three farms followed a trend of eco-efficient intensification by increasing their milk production per unit of area and livestock while maintaining (or slightly changing) their consumption of N fertilizers and N-rich concentrates. Three farms adopted agroecological practices by maintaining or decreasing their stocking rate and farm production per unit of area and livestock and overall increasing their agricultural diversity and substituting inputs (e.g., nitrogen fertilizers) with ecosystem services (e.g., nitrogen fixation by legumes). Unlike our first hypothesis, there was a fourth trend, i.e., status quo, operated by two farms. Results showed that agroecological transition reduced GHG emissions the most (by −2% to −40% per kg of milk and by −18% to −29% per ha). The dairy farms following this transition had the lowest mean product-related (0.89 kg CO2 eq./kg milk) and area-related (5306 kg CO2 eq./ha) GHG emissions. Eco-efficient intensification reduced mean product-related GHG emissions (by 10%, to 0.93 kg CO2 eq./kg milk), but increased mean area-related GHG emissions (by 18%, to 6239 kg CO2 eq./ha). In contrast, specialization and intensification increased mean GHG emissions (by 6% per kg of milk, to 1.20 kg CO2 eq./kg milk, and by 28% per ha, to 8741 kg CO2 eq./ha), making it appear unsuitable as a pathway towards mitigating climate change at the farm level.","Silage,Livestock,Land use,Greenhouse gas,Ecosystem services,Dairy farming,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Landfill gas utilization,Greenhouse gas inventory,Greenhouse gas accounting,Social venture,Social science,Perception,Manure management,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Supply chain,Scenario analysis,Public debate,Water resources,Greenhouse gas,Ecosystem services,Sustainable development,Landscape ecology,Global warming,Sustainability,Landscape ecology,Food security,Vulnerability assessment,Spatial variability,Land use,Temperate climate,Silage,Pasture,Umbrella term,Sociology of scientific knowledge,Performance indicator","G.

I also show that there exists a specific combination of target and trigger-price settings that eliminates the need to consider uncertainty regarding unconstrained aggregate emissions when regulators set emission reduction goals.

There are many ways to distribute a given total amount of emissions permits among countries, but the existing distribution methods, such as auctioning and grandfathering, have been debated. In this paper we describe a new method for allocating permits in emissions trading using the Boltzmann distribution. We introduce the Boltzmann distribution to permit allocation by combining it with concepts in emissions trading. We then demonstrate through empirical data analysis how emissions permits can be allocated in practice among participating countries. The new allocation method using the Boltzmann distribution describes the most probable, natural, and unbiased distribution of emissions permits among multiple countries. Simple and versatile, this new method holds potential for many economic and environmental applications.","Quantum mechanics,Probability and statistics,Mathematics,Fair distribution,Entropy maximization,Empirical data,Emissions trading,Econometrics,Boltzmann distribution,Allocation method,Stern Review,Stern,Political economy of climate change,Social cost,Price system,Pigovian tax,Radiative forcing,Greenhouse gas,Greenhouse effect,Primary market,Market price,International economics,Paleoclimatology,Magnitude (mathematics),Greenhouse effect,Statistical physics,Statistical finance,Stable process,Shapley value,Public economics,Proportionality (mathematics),Social processes,Proportionality (mathematics),Political science,Stochastic process,Statistical physics,Statistical mechanics,Upper class,Statistical model,Quantum mechanics","Ji-Won Park,Chae Un Kim,Walter Isard,Nicholas Stern,Ronald H.

In this paper we report results from a laboratory experiment in which subjects participate in an emissions trading market in the presence of emissions uncertainty. Subjects face exogenous, random positive or negative shocks to their emission levels after they make production and emission control plans. In some sessions we allow subjects to bank their unused permits for future use. In all sessions, subjects can trade in a reconciliation period to buy or sell extra permits following the shock realization. Subjects then report their emissions to the regulatory authority and they are placed in different inspection groups depending on their compliance history. The design of our experiment allows us to identify important interactions between emission shocks, banking, compliance and enforcement. We find that the relationship between emission shocks and price changes is significantly stronger without banking, so banking helps smooth out the price variability arising from the imperfect control of emissions. This greater price stability comes at a cost, however, since noncompliance and emissions are significantly greater when banking is allowed.","Regulatory authority,Price of stability,Microeconomics,Macroeconomics,Laboratory experiment,Imperfect,Enforcement,Emissions trading,Economics,Applied economics,Welfare economics,Toolbox,Software engineering,Pollution,Optimal control,Microeconomics,Water quality,Public economics,Microeconomics,Probit model,Petroleum,Environmental regulation,Microeconomics,Industrial organization,Environmental resource management,Public economics,Neoclassical economics,Experimental economics,Public economics,Microeconomics,Enforcement,Offset (computer science),Microeconomics,Industrial organization,State dependent,Special case,Public economics,Price of stability,Optimal allocation,Microeconomics","Timothy N.

Such agreements would enable the EU to act strategically in the permit market on behalf of its member states, although each member state is assumed to behave as a price taker in the permit market.

625,Market power in emissions trading: Strategically manipulating permit price through fringe firms,2012-01-01,Applied Energy,10.1016/J.APENERGY.2011.08.049,"Tradable emission permits have received considerable attention recently. One emerging issue is its interaction with electricity markets, specifically, market power in the permit markets. One challenge in studying market power in the permit markets is that the demand for permits is implicitly determined by the system conditions. Traditional ways of modeling market power (e.g., standard Cournot model) cannot directly apply. This paper develops a model in which Cournot firms in the market can manipulate the permit price through fringe firms. We have two central findings in this paper. First, diverting emission permits from Cournot to fringe producers always reduce the power and the permit prices, which could improve social surplus. Second, when the fringe producer’s emission rate is low, diverting permits from the “dirty” (i.e., more-polluting) Cournot producer to the “clean” (i.e., less-polluting) Cournot producer leads to a decline of both power and permit prices. Therefore, the initial allocation of the emission permits could be a useful regulatory tool to mitigate the abuse of market power.

Two types of market structure are considered: perfect competition and Cournot oligopoly. We find that output, abatement costs and the number of firms are higher under credit trading. Allowing trade between permit-trading and credit-trading sectors may increase welfare. With perfect competition, permit trading always leads to higher welfare than credit trading. With imperfect competition, credit trading may outperform permit trading. Environmental policy can lead to exit, but also to entry of firms. Entry and exit have a profound impact on the performance of the schemes, especially under imperfect competition. We find that it may be impossible to implement certain levels of total industry emissions. Under credit trading several levels of the relative standard can achieve the same total level of emissions.","Perfect competition,Microeconomics,Market structure,Imperfect competition,High-frequency trading,Emissions trading,Economics,Cournot competition,Alternative trading system,Algorithmic trading,Sustainable energy,Primary energy,Parliament,Sulfur dioxide,Pollution,Natural resource economics,Welfare,Subsidy,Social optimum,Product market,Microeconomics,Marginal abatement cost,Sustainable development,Equity (finance),Environmental resource management,Welfare,Stochastic modelling,Relative value,Treaty,Reduced cost,Obstacle,Welfare economics,Strategic behavior,Resource allocation,Public economics,Political science,Political economy of climate change,Profitability index,Profit (economics),Pollution","Jan-Tjeerd Boom,Bouwe R.

629,"Global food security, biodiversity conservation and the future of agricultural intensification",2012-01-01,Biological Conservation,10.1016/J.BIOCON.2012.01.068,"Abstract Under the current scenario of rapid human population increase, achieving efficient and productive agricultural land use while conserving biodiversity is a global challenge. There is an ongoing debate whether land for nature and for production should be segregated (land sparing) or integrated on the same land (land sharing, wildlife-friendly farming). While recent studies argue for agricultural intensification in a land sparing approach, we suggest here that it fails to account for real-world complexity. We argue that agriculture practiced under smallholder farmer-dominated landscapes and not large-scale farming, is currently the backbone of global food security in the developing world. Furthermore, contemporary food usage is inefficient with one third wasted and a further third used inefficiently to feed livestock and that conventional intensification causes often overlooked environmental costs. A major argument for wildlife friendly farming and agroecological intensification is that crucial ecosystem services are provided by “planned” and “associated” biodiversity, whereas the land sparing concept implies that biodiversity in agroecosystems is functionally negligible. However, loss of biological control can result in dramatic increases of pest densities, pollinator services affect a third of global human food supply, and inappropriate agricultural management can lead to environmental degradation. Hence, the true value of functional biodiversity on the farm is often inadequately acknowledged or understood, while conventional intensification tends to disrupt beneficial functions of biodiversity. In conclusion, linking agricultural intensification with biodiversity conservation and hunger reduction requires well-informed regional and targeted solutions, something which the land sparing vs sharing debate has failed to achieve so far.","Land grabbing,Food security,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural land,Agricultural biodiversity,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Subsistence agriculture,Rural sociology,Rural poverty,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination management,Geography,Food waste,Food systems,User Friendly,Poverty,Operational framework,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide,World population,Total economic value,Pollinator decline","Teja Tscharntke,Yann Clough,Thomas Cherico Wanger,Louise Jackson,H.

631,"Agricultural sustainability: concepts, principles and evidence",2008-01-01,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B,10.1098/RSTB.2007.2163,"Concerns about sustainability in agricultural systems centre on the need to develop technologies and practices that do not have adverse effects on environmental goods and services, are accessible to and effective for farmers, and lead to improvements in food productivity. Despite great progress in agricultural productivity in the past half-century, with crop and livestock productivity strongly driven by increased use of fertilizers, irrigation water, agricultural machinery, pesticides and land, it would be over-optimistic to assume that these relationships will remain linear in the future. New approaches are needed that will integrate biological and ecological processes into food production, minimize the use of those non-renewable inputs that cause harm to the environment or to the health of farmers and consumers, make productive use of the knowledge and skills of farmers, so substituting human capital for costly external inputs, and make productive use of people's collective capacities to work together to solve common agricultural and natural resource problems, such as for pest, watershed, irrigation, forest and credit management. These principles help to build important capital assets for agricultural systems: natural; social; human; physical; and financial capital. Improving natural capital is a central aim, and dividends can come from making the best use of the genotypes of crops and animals and the ecological conditions under which they are grown or raised. Agricultural sustainability suggests a focus on both genotype improvements through the full range of modern biological approaches and improved understanding of the benefits of ecological and agronomic management, manipulation and redesign. The ecological management of agroecosystems that addresses energy flows, nutrient cycling, population-regulating mechanisms and system resilience can lead to the redesign of agriculture at a landscape scale. Sustainable agriculture outcomes can be positive for food productivity, reduced pesticide use and carbon balances. Significant challenges, however, remain to develop national and international policies to support the wider emergence of more sustainable forms of agricultural production across both industrialized and developing countries.","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Natural capital,Good agricultural practice,Ecology,Biology,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural communication,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Social reproduction,Social capital,Public administration,Obesity,Medicine,Epidemiology of obesity,Social science,Social reproduction,Social mobility,Tragedy of the commons,Tragedy of the anticommons,Natural resource,Socio-ecological system,Social network,Social learning,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Valuation (finance),Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Subsistence agriculture,Rural management,Rural economics,Manure management,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use","Jules N Pretty,Robert Costanza,Rudolf de Groot,Stephen Farberk,Monica Grasso,Bruce Hannon,Robert D.

632,Does organic farming benefit biodiversity,2005-01-01,Biological Conservation,10.1016/J.BIOCON.2004.07.018,"Abstract The intensification and expansion of modern agriculture is amongst the greatest current threats to worldwide biodiversity. Over the last quarter of the 20th century, dramatic declines in both range and abundance of many species associated with farmland have been reported in Europe, leading to growing concern over the sustainability of current intensive farming practices. Purportedly ‘sustainable’ farming systems such as organic farming are now seen by many as a potential solution to this continued loss of biodiversity and receive substantial support in the form of subsidy payments through EU and national government legislation. This paper assesses the impacts on biodiversity of organic farming, relative to conventional agriculture, through a review of comparative studies of the two systems, in order to determine whether it can deliver on the biodiversity benefits its proponents claim. It identifies a wide range of taxa, including birds and mammals, invertebrates and arable flora, that benefit from organic management through increases in abundance and/or species richness. It also highlights three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilisers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming, and that are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife. However, the review also draws attention to four key issues: (1) It remains unclear whether a ‘holistic’ whole-farm approach (i.e. organic) provides greater benefits to biodiversity than carefully targeted prescriptions applied to relatively small areas of cropped and/or non-cropped habitats within conventional agriculture (i.e. agri-environment schemes); (2) Many comparative studies encounter methodological problems, limiting their ability to draw quantitative conclusions; (3) Our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming in pastoral and upland agriculture is limited; (4) There remains a pressing need for longitudinal, system-level studies in order to address these issues and to fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming, before a full appraisal of its potential role in biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems can be made.","Sustainability,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Intensive farming,Integrated farming,Ecology,Ecological farming,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat,Socioeconomics,Population,Northern lapwing,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Land use,Intensive farming,Integrated farming,Wildlife,Geography,Agricultural policy,Surface runoff,Soil organic matter,Land use,Weed control,Weed,Sustainable agriculture,Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism,Soil water,Soil type,Soil type,Soil organic matter,Soil management","D.G.

634,"Agroecology as a science, a movement and a practice. A review",2009-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1051/AGRO/2009004,"Agroecology involves various approaches to solve actual challenges of agricultural production. Though agroecology initially dealt primarily with crop production and protection aspects, in recent decades new dimensions such as environmental, social, economic, ethical and development issues are becoming relevant. Today, the term 'agroecology' means either a scientific discipline, agricultural practice, or political or social movement. Here we study the different meanings of agroecology. For that we analyse the historical development of agroecology. We present examples from USA, Brazil, Germany, and France. We study and discuss the evolution of different meanings agroecology. The use of the term agroecology can be traced back to the 1930s. Until the 1960s agroecology referred only as a purely scientific discipline. Then, different branches of agroecology developed. Following environmental movements in the 1960s that went against industrial agriculture, agroecology evolved and fostered agroecological movements in the 1990s. Agroecology as an agricultural practice emerged in the 1980s, and was often intertwined with movements. Further, the scales and dimensions of agroecological investigations changed over the past 80 years from the plot and field scales to the farm and agroecosystem scales. Actually three approaches persist: (1) investigations at plot and field scales, (2) investigations at the agroecosystem and farm scales, and (3) investigations covering the whole food system. These different approaches of agroecological science can be explained by the history of nations. In France, agroecology was mainly understood as a farming practice and to certain extent as a movement, whereas the corresponding scientific discipline was agronomy. In Germany, agroecology has a long tradition as a scientific discipline. In the USA and in Brazil all three interpretations of agroecology occur, albeit with a predominance of agroecology as a science in the USA and a stronger emphasis on movement and agricultural practice in Brazil. These varied meanings of the term agroecology cause confusion among scientists and the public, and we recommend that those who publish using this term be explicit in their interpretation. agroecosystem / Brazil / food system / France / Germany / rural development / scientific discipline / sustainable agriculture / USA","Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Social movement,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecosystem analysis,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Agroecological restoration,Sustainable development,Resource management,Natural resource management,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Food systems,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization,Valuation (finance),Sociology,Food systems,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Whole food,Sustainable agriculture,Social science,Viewpoints,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Sustainability,Rural history,Green Revolution,Sustainability,Social system,Social network analysis,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability","A.

Particularly in tropical areas, agriculture is frequently seen as the antithesis of the natural world, where the problem is framed as one of minimizing land devoted to agriculture so as to devote more to conservation of biodiversity and other ecosystem services. In particular, the “forest transition model” projects an overly optimistic vision of a future where increased agricultural intensification (to produce more per hectare) and/or increased rural-to-urban migration (to reduce the rural population that cuts forest for agriculture) suggests a near future of much tropical aforestation and higher agricultural production. Reviewing recent developments in ecological theory (showing the importance of migration between fragments and local extinction rates) coupled with empirical evidence, we argue that there is little to suggest that the forest transition model is useful for tropical areas, at least under current sociopolitical structures. A model that incorporates the agricultural matrix as an integral component of conservation programs is proposed. Furthermore, we suggest that this model will be most successful within a framework of small-scale agroecological production.","Urbanization,Land use,Geography,Forest transition,Ecosystem services,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural land,Wildlife conservation,Land management,Habitat,Population,Organic farming,Food systems,Soil organic matter,Organic farming,No-till farming,Precision viticulture,Precision agriculture,Engineering,Willow,Thicket,Taxon,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Soil quality,Urbanization,Tropics,Secondary forest,Quantitative genetics,Population,Metapopulation,Wildlife conservation,Tropics,Species richness,Shade-grown coffee,Habitat,Ecology","Ivette Perfecto,John Vandermeer,Rhys E.

636,Pursuing sustainable productivity with millions of smallholder farmers.,2018-01-01,Nature,10.1038/NATURE25785,"Millions of Chinese smallholder farmers were persuaded to adopt enhanced management practices, which led to a greater yield, reduced nitrogen fertilizer use and improved environmental performance throughout China. Two and a half billion smallholder farmers collectively manage 60 per cent of the world's arable land. How these farmers perform determines their own livelihood, but also affects global food security and ecosystem health. Here, Fusuo Zhang and colleagues show how some straightforward interventions have substantially improved the productivity and environmental performance of smallholder farmers across China over the past ten years. The team carried out more than 13,000 field trials across China's main agroecological zones and found that a series of management practices, collectively termed integrated soil–crop system management, increased maize, wheat and rice yields, nitrogen-use efficiency and farmer profitability. Scaling this approach up to 20.9 million smallholder farmer across 452 counties boosted grain yields to 33 million tonnes over the ten-year period, and reduced fertilizer use by 1.2 million tonnes and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 13 per cent. Sustainably feeding a growing population is a grand challenge1,2,3, and one that is particularly difficult in regions that are dominated by smallholder farming. Despite local successes4,5,6,7,8, mobilizing vast smallholder communities with science- and evidence-based management practices to simultaneously address production and pollution problems has been infeasible. Here we report the outcome of concerted efforts in engaging millions of Chinese smallholder farmers to adopt enhanced management practices for greater yield and environmental performance. First, we conducted field trials across China’s major agroecological zones to develop locally applicable recommendations using a comprehensive decision-support program. Engaging farmers to adopt those recommendations involved the collaboration of a core network of 1,152 researchers with numerous extension agents and agribusiness personnel. From 2005 to 2015, about 20.9 million farmers in 452 counties adopted enhanced management practices in fields with a total of 37.7 million cumulative hectares over the years. Average yields (maize, rice and wheat) increased by 10.8–11.5%, generating a net grain output of 33 million tonnes (Mt). At the same time, application of nitrogen decreased by 14.7–18.1%, saving 1.2 Mt of nitrogen fertilizers. The increased grain output and decreased nitrogen fertilizer use were equivalent to US$12.2 billion.

637,Agroecology and the design of climate change-resilient farming systems,2015-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-015-0285-2,"Diverse, severe, and location-specific impacts on agricultural production are anticipated with climate change. The last IPCC report indicates that the rise of CO2 and associated “greenhouse” gases could lead to a 1.4 to 5.8 °C increase in global surface temperatures, with subsequent consequences on precipitation frequency and amounts. Temperature and water availability remain key factors in determining crop growth and productivity; predicted changes in these factors will lead to reduced crop yields. Climate-induced changes in insect pest, pathogen and weed population dynamics and invasiveness could compound such effects. Undoubtedly, climate- and weather-induced instability will affect levels of and access to food supply, altering social and economic stability and regional competiveness. Adaptation is considered a key factor that will shape the future severity of climate change impacts on food production. Changes that will not radically modify the monoculture nature of dominant agroecosystems may moderate negative impacts temporarily. The biggest and most durable benefits will likely result from more radical agroecological measures that will strengthen the resilience of farmers and rural communities, such as diversification of agroecosytems in the form of polycultures, agroforestry systems, and crop-livestock mixed systems accompanied by organic soil management, water conservation and harvesting, and general enhancement of agrobiodiversity. Traditional farming systems are repositories of a wealth of principles and measures that can help modern agricultural systems become more resilient to climatic extremes. Many of these agroecological strategies that reduce vulnerabilities to climate variability include crop diversification, maintaining local genetic diversity, animal integration, soil organic management, water conservation and harvesting, etc. Understanding the agroecological features that underlie the resilience of traditional agroecosystems is an urgent matter, as they can serve as the foundation for the design of adapted agricultural systems. Observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events (hurricanes and droughts) in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to farms with increased levels of biodiversity. Field surveys and results reported in the literature suggest that agroecosystems are more resilient when inserted in a complex landscape matrix, featuring adapted local germplasm deployed in diversified cropping systems managed with organic matter rich soils and water conservation-harvesting techniques. The identification of systems that have withstood climatic events recently or in the past and understanding the agroecological features of such systems that allowed them to resist and/or recover from extreme events is of increased urgency, as the derived resiliency principles and practices that underlie successful farms can be disseminated to thousands of farmers via Campesino a Campesino networks to scale up agroecological practices that enhance the resiliency of agroecosystems. The effective diffusion of agroecological technologies will largely determine how well and how fast farmers adapt to climate change.","Water conservation,Population,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural diversification,Agricultural biodiversity,Adaptive capacity,Working group,Vulnerability,Sustainability and systemic change resistance,Socio-ecological system,Social network,Social learning,Growing season,Geography,Food prices,Sociology,Socio-ecological system,Social science,Total human ecosystem,Species diversity,Geography,Negative response,Land use,Growing season,Sustainable development,Public policy,Political economy of climate change,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Population,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant","Miguel A.

638,Invited review: Learning from the future-A vision for dairy farms and cows in 2067.,2018-01-01,Journal of Dairy Science,10.3168/JDS.2017-14025,"ABSTRACT The worldwide population in 2067 will reach 10.4 billion with 81% residing in Africa or Asia. Arable land available for food production will decrease to 0.15 ha per person. Temperature will increase in tropical and temperate zones, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, and this will push growing seasons and dairy farming away from arid areas and into more northern latitudes. Dairy consumption will increase because it provides essential nutrients more efficiently than many other agricultural systems. Dairy farming will become modernized in developing countries and milk production per cow will increase, doubling in countries with advanced dairying systems. Profitability of dairy farms will be the key to their sustainability. Genetic improvements will include emphasis on the coding genome and associated noncoding epigenome of cattle, and on microbiomes of dairy cattle and farmsteads. Farm sizes will increase and there will be greater lateral integration of housing and management of dairy cattle of different ages and production stages. Integrated sensors, robotics, and automation will replace much of the manual labor on farms. Managing the epigenome and microbiome will become part of routine herd management. Innovations in dairy facilities will improve the health of cows and permit expression of natural behaviors. Herds will be viewed as superorganisms, and studies of herds as observational units will lead to improvements in productivity, health, and well-being of dairy cattle, and improve the agroecology and sustainability of dairy farms. Dairy farmers in 2067 will meet the world's needs for essential nutrients by adopting technologies and practices that provide improved cow health and longevity, profitable dairy farms, and sustainable agriculture.","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Population,Food processing,Dairy farming,Dairy cattle,Biology,Biochemistry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural science,World population,Water resources,Overconsumption,Weaning,Starter,Rumen,Sustainability,Life-cycle assessment,Food choice,Sire,Pregnancy rate,Population,Population,Manure,Livestock,Rumen,Pyrosequencing,Microbiome,Raw material,Population,Livestock,Supply chain,Ruminant,Livestock,Population,Microbiome,Microbiology,Water use,Water supply,Water resources","J.

This growth has not been supported adequately by rigorous research to address challenges such as arthropod pest management. The research that has been conducted, however, is complemented by research in aspects of conventional agriculture that may have applicability in organic systems, as well as by research in underpinning fields such as applied ecology. This article synthesizes the available literature in relation to a conceptual model of arthropod pest management strategies suitable for organic systems. The present work uses the four phases of the model to review the strategies in an agroecological context and provides a synthesis of the factors that influence the success of each phase. Rather than constituting a fringe science, pest management research for organic systems draws on cutting edge science in fields such as landscape and chemical ecology and has a bright future.","Pest control,Organic farming,Integrated pest management,Fringe science,Ecology,Conceptual model,Biology,Applied ecology,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainability,Statistics,Principles of Organic Agriculture,Pyrethrum,Pesticide,Integrated pest management,Zoology,Toxicology,Toxicity,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation,Species richness,Population density,Organic farming,Push–pull strategy,Push pull,Push and pull,Peptide sequence,Microbiology,Gene product,Tillage,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil organic matter,Host (biology),Glossary,Genetic variation,Jealousy,Integrated pest management,Ecology","Geoff Zehnder,Geoff M.

New approaches and technologies involving application of blended modern agricultural science and indigenous knowledge systems and spearheaded by thousands of farmers, NGOs, and some government and academic institutions are proving to enhance food security while conserving agrobiodiversity soil and water resources conservation throughout hundreds of rural communities in the developing world. Case studies from Cuba, Brazil, Philippines, and Africa are presented to demonstrate how the agroecological development paradigm based on the revitalization of small farms which emphasizes diversity, synergy, recycling and integration, and social processes that value community participation and empowerment, proves to be perhaps one of the only viable options to meet present and future food needs. Given the present and predicted near future climate, energy and economic scenarios, agroecology has emerged as one of the most robust pathways towards designing biodiverse, productive, and resilient agroecosystems available today.","Sustainable development,Peasant,Food sovereignty,Food security,Empowerment,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural biodiversity,Sustainable agriculture,Soil conservation,Integrated pest management,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant,Rural population,Public policy,Private sector,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable development,Resource management,Natural resource management,Sociology,Social issues,Political economy,Social movement,Peasant,Grassroots,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization,Hectare,Global hectare,Food security,Sustainable agriculture,Sociocultural evolution,Environmental resource management","Miguel A.

641,Global hot-spots of heat stress on agricultural crops due to climate change,2013-01-01,Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,10.1016/J.AGRFORMET.2011.09.002,"Abstract The productivity of important agricultural crops is drastically reduced when they experience short episodes of high temperatures during the reproductive period. Crop heat stress was acknowledged in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report as an important threat to global food supply. We produce a first spatial assessment of heat stress risk at a global level for four key crops, wheat, maize, rice and soybean, using the FAO/IIASA Global Agro-Ecological Zones Model (GAEZ). A high risk of yield damage was found for continental lands at high latitudes, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere between 40 and 60°N. Central and Eastern Asia, Central North America and the Northern part of the Indian subcontinent have large suitable cropping areas under heat stress risk. Globally, this ranged from less than 5 Mha of suitable lands for maize for the baseline climate (1971–2000) to more than 120 Mha for wetland rice for a future climate change condition (2071–2100) assuming the A1B emission scenario. For most crops and regions, the intensity, frequency and relative damage due to heat stress increased from the baseline to the A1B scenario. However for wheat and rice crops, GAEZ selection of different crop types and sowing dates in response to A1B seasonal climate caused a reduction in heat stress impacts in some regions, which suggests that adaptive measures considering these management options may partially mitigate heat stress at local level. Our results indicate that temperate and sub-tropical agricultural areas might bear substantial crop yield losses due to extreme temperature episodes and they highlight the need to develop adaptation strategies and agricultural policies able to mitigate heat stress impacts on global food supply.","Temperate climate,Food security,Ecology,Cropping,Crop yield,Crop,Climatology,Climate change,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Vulnerability,Sustainability,Latin Americans,Working group,Vulnerability,Sustainability and systemic change resistance,Runaway climate change,Natural resource economics,Environmental engineering,Population,Natural resource economics,Kaya identity,Special Report on Emissions Scenarios,Environmental science,Environmental resource management,Hot Temperature,Growing season,Greenhouse effect,Tropics,Temperate climate,Subtropics,Transgene,Transformation (genetics),Photosynthesis,Strengths and weaknesses,Natural resource economics,Greenhouse effect,Sustainable development,Public policy,Political economy of climate change","Edmar I.

642,Diversification practices reduce organic to conventional yield gap,2015-01-01,Proceedings of The Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,10.1098/RSPB.2014.1396,"Agriculture today places great strains on biodiversity, soils, water and the atmosphere, and these strains will be exacerbated if current trends in population growth, meat and energy consumption, and food waste continue. Thus, farming systems that are both highly productive and minimize environmental harms are critically needed. How organic agriculture may contribute to world food production has been subject to vigorous debate over the past decade. Here, we revisit this topic comparing organic and conventional yields with a new meta-dataset three times larger than previously used (115 studies containing more than 1000 observations) and a new hierarchical analytical framework that can better account for the heterogeneity and structure in the data. We find organic yields are only 19.2% (±3.7%) lower than conventional yields, a smaller yield gap than previous estimates. More importantly, we find entirely different effects of crop types and management practices on the yield gap compared with previous studies. For example, we found no significant differences in yields for leguminous versus non-leguminous crops, perennials versus annuals or developed versus developing countries. Instead, we found the novel result that two agricultural diversification practices, multi-cropping and crop rotations, substantially reduce the yield gap (to 9 ± 4% and 8 ± 5%, respectively) when the methods were applied in only organic systems. These promising results, based on robust analysis of a larger meta-dataset, suggest that appropriate investment in agroecological research to improve organic management systems could greatly reduce or eliminate the yield gap for some crops or regions.","Yield gap,Organic farming,Food processing,Environmental science,Diversification (marketing strategy),Crop rotation,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Agricultural diversification,Planetary boundaries,Humanity,Fresh water,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Regression analysis,Proper linear model,Polynomial regression,Variance estimation,Statistics,Regression,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Water pollution,Surface runoff,Ocean deoxygenation,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Soil fertility,Sustainability,Statistics,Principles of Organic Agriculture","Lauren C.

We present an integrated landscape approach to promote research in human-modified landscapes that includes the effects of landscape structure and dynamics on conservation of biodiversity, provision of ecosystem services, and sustainability of rural livelihoods. We propose research priorities encompassing three major areas: biodiversity, human–environment interactions, and restoration ecology. We highlight key areas where we lack knowledge and where additional understanding is most urgent for promoting conservation and sustaining rural livelihoods. Finally, we recommend participatory and multidisciplinary approaches in research and management. Lasting conservation efforts demand new alliances among conservation biologists, agroecologists, agronomists, farmers, indigenous peoples, rural social movements, foresters, social scientists, and land managers to collaborate in research, co-design conservation programs and policies, and manage human-modified landscapes in ways that enhance biodiversity conservation and promote sustainable livelihoods.","Traditional knowledge,Sustainability,Rural area,Restoration ecology,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Ecoagriculture,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroecology,Tragedy of the commons,Sustainability,Psychological resilience,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Total human ecosystem,Species diversity,Geography,Transparency (graphic),Social relation,Poverty,Willingness to pay,Service provider,Public economics,Global change,Geography,Forest ecology,Recreation,Measurement of biodiversity,Human Dimension,Psychological resilience,Greenhouse gas,Forest management,Public economics,Property rights,Program Design Language,Pollinator decline,Pollination,Peponapis pruinosa","Robin L.

Based on farm household and Participatory Rural Appraisal data collected from districts in various agroecological zones in Kenya, this paper examines farmers' perceptions of climate change, ongoing adaptation measures, and factors influencing farmers' decisions to adapt. The results show that households face considerable challenges in adapting to climate change. While many households have made small adjustments to their farming practices in response to climate change (in particular, changing planting decisions), few households are able to make more costly investments, for example in agroforestry or irrigation, although there is a desire to invest in such measures. This emphasizes the need for greater investments in rural and agricultural development to support the ability of households to make strategic, long-term decisions that affect their future well-being.","Political economy of climate change,Participatory rural appraisal,Environmental resource management,Climate change,Chemistry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural development,Adaptive capacity,Water resources,Vulnerability index,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Social psychology (sociology),Psychological resilience,Sustainable development,Public policy,Political economy of climate change,Tree planting,Soil conservation,Socioeconomics,Specification,Sorghum,Panel analysis,Subsistence agriculture,Sharecropping,Incentive,Vulnerability,Risk perception,Perception,Tree planting,Subsistence agriculture,Soil conservation,Public policy,Political economy of climate change,Multiple cropping,Socioeconomics,Probit model,Natural resource","Elizabeth Bryan,Claudia Ringler,Barrack Okoba,Carla Roncoli,Silvia Silvestri,Mario Herrero,James J.

A number of countries have organized their economies around a competitive export-oriented agricultural sector, based mainly on monocultures. It may be argued that agricultural exports of crops such as soybeans from Brazil make significant contributions to the national economies by bringing in hard currency that can be used to purchase other goods from abroad. However, this type of industrial agriculture also brings a variety of economic, environmental, and social problems, including negative impacts on public health, ecosystem integrity, food quality, and in many cases disruption of traditional rural livelihoods, while accelerating indebtedness among thousands of farmers.This article can also be found at the Monthly Review website, where most recent articles are published in full.Click here to purchase a PDF version of this article at the Monthly Review website.","Sociology,Social issues,Political economy,Livelihood,Intensive farming,Hard currency,Food sovereignty,Developing country,Agroecology,Agriculture,Hectare,Global hectare,Food security,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Sustainable agriculture,Sociocultural evolution,Environmental resource management,Trade barrier,International trade,Free trade,Water content,Shade tree,Rainfed agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Latin Americans,Geography,Vision,Political science,Economy,Indigenous,Economy,Business,Vulnerability,Sustainable development,Geography,Plant breeding,Pest control,Multiple cropping","Miguel A.

647,Closing yield gaps in China by empowering smallholder farmers,2016-01-01,Nature,10.1038/NATURE19368,"The authors report on attempts to increase the yield of smallholder farms in China using ten practices recommended by the Science and Technology Backyard for farming maize and wheat at county level. Closing the gap between realized and potential crop yields is key to sustainably feeding the world's growing population. Fusuo Zhang and colleagues report on attempts to increase wheat and maize yields of smallholder farms in four villages in Quzhou County in the North China Plain, using ten practices recommended by the Science and Technology Backyard, a co-operative research project involving agricultural scientists, local extension officers and smallholder farmers. Adoption of these practices—including alternative seed varieties, sowing times and other crop management practices—raised five-year-average yields from 68% to 97% of the attainable level on target farms, and 63% to 80% countywide. The authors suggest that this approach could be adopted in other parts of the world to help smallholder farmers achieve greater yields. Sustainably feeding the world’s growing population is a challenge1,2,3, and closing yield gaps (that is, differences between farmers’ yields and what are attainable for a given region)4,5,6 is a vital strategy to address this challenge3,4,7. The magnitude of yield gaps is particularly large in developing countries where smallholder farming dominates the agricultural landscape4,7. Many factors and constraints interact to limit yields3,4,5,6,8,9,10, and progress in problem-solving to bring about changes at the ground level is rare. Here we present an innovative approach for enabling smallholders to achieve yield and economic gains sustainably via the Science and Technology Backyard (STB) platform. STB involves agricultural scientists living in villages among farmers, advancing participatory innovation and technology transfer, and garnering public and private support. We identified multifaceted yield-limiting factors involving agronomic, infrastructural, and socioeconomic conditions. When these limitations and farmers’ concerns were addressed, the farmers adopted recommended management practices, thereby improving production outcomes. In one region in China, the five-year average yield increased from 67.9% of the attainable level to 97.0% among 71 leading farmers, and from 62.8% to 79.6% countywide (93,074 households); this was accompanied by resource and economic benefits.","Sustainability,Population,Developing country,Crop yield,Climate change mitigation,China,Business,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Yield gap,Sustainability,Population growth,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Scholarship,Yield gap,Irrigation,Growing season,Reactive nitrogen,Intensive farming,Hectare,Yield gap,Population,Land use,Crop yield,Crop,Biology","Weifeng Zhang,Guoxin Cao,Xiaolin Li,Hongyan Zhang,Chong Wang,Quanqing Liu,Xinping Chen,Zhenling Cui,Jianbo Shen,Rongfeng Jiang,Guohua Mi,Yuxin Miao,Fusuo Zhang,Zhengxia Dou,H.

Cuban peasants have been able to boost food production without scarce and expensive imported agricultural chemicals by first substituting more ecological inputs for the no longer available imports, and then by making a transition to more agroecologically integrated and diverse farming systems. This was possible not so much because appropriate alternatives were made available, but rather because of the Campesino-a-Campesino (CAC) social process methodology that the National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP) used to build a grassroots agroecology movement. This paper was produced in a ‘self-study’ process spearheaded by ANAP and La Via Campesina, the international agrarian movement of which ANAP is a member.

A review,2013-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-013-0180-7,"The forecasted 9.1 billion population in 2050 will require an increase in food production for an additional two billion people. There is thus an active debate on new farming practices that could produce more food in a sustainable way. Here, we list agroecological cropping practices in temperate areas. We classify practices according to efficiency, substitution, and redesign. We analyse their advantages and drawbacks with emphasis on diversification. We evaluate the potential use of the practices for future agriculture. Our major findings are: (1) we distinguish 15 categories of agroecological practices (7 practices involve increasing efficiency or substitution, and 8 practices need a redesign often based on diversification). (2) The following agroecological practices are so far poorly integrated in actual agriculture: biofertilisers; natural pesticides; crop choice and rotations; intercropping and relay intercropping; agroforestry with timber, fruit, or nut trees; allelopathic plants; direct seeding into living cover crops or mulch; and integration of semi-natural landscape elements at field and farm or their management at landscape scale. These agroecological practices have only a moderate potential to be broadly implemented in the next decade. (3) By contrast, the following practices are already well integrated: organic fertilisation, split fertilisation, reduced tillage, drip irrigation, biological pest control, and cultivar choice.","Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Population,Intercropping,Cropping,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agroecological restoration,Agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Pyrethrum,Pesticide,Integrated pest management,Symbiosis,Rhizosphere,Rhizobacteria,Geography,Ecosystem diversity,Ecosystem,Vegetation,Species diversity,Global biodiversity,Rhizosphere,Rhizobacteria,Endophyte,Species richness,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Soil biology,Rhizosphere,Rhizobacteria,Rhizosphere,Rhizobacteria,Phyllosphere,Pesticide,Pest control,Myrtaceae","Alexander Wezel,Marion Casagrande,Florian Celette,Jean-François Vian,Aurélie Ferrer,Joséphine Peigné,David Tilman,Kenneth G.

Reorientation towards more holistic approaches, including agroecology, has recently been backed by a global international assessment of agriculture S&T for development (IAASTD). Understanding the past and current trends of agricultural S&T is crucial if such recommendations are to be implemented. This paper shows how the concepts of technological paradigms and trajectories can help analyse the agricultural S&T landscape and dynamics. Genetic engineering and agroecology can be usefully analysed as two different technological paradigms, even though they have not been equally successful in influencing agricultural research. We used a Systems of Innovation (SI) approach to identify the determinants of innovation (the factors that influence research choices) within agricultural research systems. The influence of each determinant is systematically described (e.g. funding priorities, scientists' cognitive and cultural routines etc.). As a result of their interactions, these determinants construct a technological regime and a lock-in situation that hinders the development of agroecological engineering. Issues linked to breaking out of this lock-in situation are finally discussed.","Systems of innovation,Scrutiny,Path dependence,Marketing,Global international,Evolutionary economics,Economics,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sociology,Public relations,Public administration,Technological innovation system,Regional innovation system,Public economics,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Geography,Environmental resource management,Public administration,Political science,Climate change,Theory of the firm,Technological transitions,Technical change,Technological transitions,Technological innovation system,Technological change,Technological transitions,Supply and demand,Subsidy,Unit of analysis,Technology and society,Technological transitions,Path dependency,Path dependence,Path creation,Situated,Public administration,Politics","Gaëtan Vanloqueren,Philippe V.

Nevertheless, since the ‘first green revolution’, less attention has been given to beneficial soil microorganisms in general and to AM fungi in particular. Human society benefits from a multitude of resources and processes from natural and managed ecosystems, to which AM make a crucial contribution. These resources and processes, which are called ecosystem services, include products like food and processes like nutrient transfer. Many people have been under the illusion that these ecosystem services are free, invulnerable and infinitely available; taken for granted as public benefits, they lack a formal market and are traditionally absent from society’s balance sheet. In 1997, a team of researchers from the USA, Argentina and the Netherlands put an average price tag of US $33 trillion a year on these fundamental ecosystem services. The present review highlights the key role that the AM symbiosis can play as an ecosystem service provider to guarantee plant productivity and quality in emerging systems of sustainable agriculture. The appropriate management of ecosystem services rendered by AM will impact on natural resource conservation and utilisation with an obvious net gain for human society.","Sustainable management,Sustainable agriculture,Natural resource,Ecosystem services,Ecosystem management,Ecosystem health,Ecology,Botany,Biology,Agroecology,Agriculture,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Valuation (finance),Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Welfare,Performance measurement,National accounts,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Typology,Resource management,Natural resource management,Polyphyly,Phylum,Monophyly,Service provider,Public policy,Payment for ecosystem services,Soil water,Soil structure,Soil ecology,Symbiosis,Soil microbiology,Salinity","Silvio Gianinazzi,Armelle Gollotte,Marie-Noëlle Binet,Diederik van Tuinen,Dirk Redecker,Daniel Wipf,Robert Costanza,Rudolf de Groot,Stephen Farberk,Monica Grasso,Bruce Hannon,Jonathan A.

Such issues are food insecurity, lower income in traditional low-input agroecosystems, adverse effects of pesticide use on human health and on the environment in intensive systems and export restrictions due to strict regulations on quarantine pests and limits on pesticide residues. To provide more and better food to populations in both the southern and northern hemispheres in a sustainable manner, there is a need for a drastic reduction in pesticide use while keeping crop pest and disease damage under control. This can be achieved by breaking with industrial agriculture and using an agroecological approach, whose main pillar is the conservation or introduction of plant diversity in agroecosystems. Earlier literature suggest that increasing vegetational biodiversity in agroecosystems can reduce the impact of pests and diseases by the following mechanisms: (1) resource dilution and stimulo-deterrent diversion, (2) disruption of the spatial cycle, (3) disruption of the temporal cycle, (4) allelopathy effects, (5) general and specific soil suppressiveness, (6) crop physiological resistance, (7) conservation of natural enemies and facilitation of their action against aerial pests and (8) direct and indirect architectural/physical effects. Here we review the reported examples of such effects on a broad range of pathogens and pests, e.g. insects, mites, myriapods, nematodes, parasitic weeds, fungi, bacteria and viruses across different cropping systems. Our review confirms that it is not necessarily true that vegetational diversification reduces the incidence of pests and diseases. The ability of some pests and pathogens to use a wide range of plants as alternative hosts/reservoirs is the main limitation to the suppressive role of this strategy, but all other pathways identified for the control of pests and disease based on plant species diversity (PSD) also have certain limitations. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms involved should enable us to explain how, where and when exceptions to the above principle are likely to occur, with a view to developing sustainable agroecosystems based on enhanced ecological processes of pest and disease control by optimized vegetational diversification.","Sustainable management,Intensive farming,Integrated pest management,Ecology,Cropping,Conservation agriculture,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Species richness,Pest control,PEST analysis,Paddy field,Oryza sativa,Monoculture,Push–pull strategy,Push pull,Push and pull,Streptomyces scabies,Soil microbiology,Soil biology,Zoology,Typhlodromus,Phytoseiulus,Sustainable agriculture,Literature survey,Ecosystem services","Alain Ratnadass,Paula Fernandes,Jacques Avelino,Robert Habib,David Tilman,Kenneth G.

While sharing some of the concerns of (1), I am sceptical about (2) because of how FS conceives ‘peasants’, and the claim of some of its leading advocates that small producers who practice agroecological farming – understood as low (external)-input and labour-intensive – can feed the world.

656,Communicating complexity: Integrated assessment of trade-offs concerning soil fertility management within African farming systems to support innovation and development,2011-01-01,Agricultural Systems,10.1016/J.AGSY.2010.07.002,"African farming systems are highly heterogeneous: between agroecological and socioeconomic environments, in the wide variability in farmers' resource endowments and in farm management. This means that single solutions (or 'silver bullets') for improving farm productivity do not exist. Yet to date few approaches to understand constraints and explore options for change have tackled the bewildering complexity of African farming systems. In this paper we describe the Nutrient Use in Animal and Cropping systems - Efficiencies and Scales (NUANCES) framework. NUANCES offers a structured approach to unravel and understand the complexity of African farming to identify what we term 'best-fit' technologies - technologies targeted to specific types of farmers and to specific niches within their farms. The NUANCES framework is not 'just another computer model'! We combine the tools of systems analysis and experimentation, detailed field observations and surveys, incorporate expert knowledge (local knowledge and results of research), generate databases, and apply simulation models to analyse performance of farms, and the impacts of introducing new technologies. We have analysed and described complexity of farming systems, their external drivers and some of the mechanisms that result in (in)efficient use of scarce resources. Studying sites across sub-Saharan Africa has provided insights in the trajectories of change in farming systems in response to population growth, economic conditions and climate variability (cycles of drier and wetter years) and climate change. In regions where human population is dense and land scarce, farm typologies have proven useful to target technologies between farmers of different production objectives and resource endowment (notably in terms of land, labour and capacity for investment). In such regions we could categorise types of fields on the basis of their responsiveness to soil improving technologies along soil fertility gradients, relying on local indicators to differentiate those that may be managed through 'maintenance fertilization' from fields that are highly-responsive to fertilizers and fields that require rehabilitation before yields can improved. Where human population pressure on the land is less intense, farm and field types are harder to discern, without clear patterns. Nutrient cycling through livestock is in principle not efficient for increasing food production due to increased nutrient losses, but is attractive for farmers due to the multiple functions of livestock. We identified trade-offs between income generation, soil conservation and community agreements through optimising concurrent objectives at farm and village levels. These examples show that future analyses must focus at farm and farming system level and not at the level of individual fields to achieve appropriate targeting of technologies - both between locations and between farms at any given location. The approach for integrated assessment described here can be used ex ante to explore the potential of best-fit technologies and the ways they can be best combined at farm level. The dynamic and integrated nature of the framework allows the impact of changes in external drivers such as climate change or development policy to be analysed. Fundamental questions for integrated analysis relate to the site-specific knowledge and the simplification of processes required to integrate and move from one level to the next.","Soil conservation,Scarcity,Population,Land use,Integrated farming,Environmental resource management,Emerging technologies,Economics,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Tithonia,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil governance,Vulnerability,Self-insurance,Rural poverty,Topsoil,Soil water,Soil test,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Soil fertility,Soil type,Soil quality,Soil organic matter,Welfare,Poverty,Longitudinal data,West african,West africa,Tropics,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil management,Soil horizon,Spatial ecology,Soil organic matter,Soil management","K.E.

Controversy has arisen around this framework partly because many scholars have focused specifically on food production rather than more encompassing notions such as land scarcity or food security. Controversy further surrounds the practical value of partial trade-off analyses, the ways in which biodiversity should be quantified, and a series of scale effects that are not readily accounted for.

Although it is true that extreme climatic events can severely impact small farmers, available data is just a gross approximation at understanding the heterogeneity of small scale agriculture ignoring the myriad of strategies that thousands of traditional farmers have used and still use to deal with climatic variability. Scientists have now realized that many small farmers cope with and even prepare for climate change, minimizing crop failure through a series of agroecological practices. Observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to the high level of on-farm biodiversity, a typical feature of traditional farming systems.","Small-scale agriculture,Psychological resilience,Global warming,Food security,Environmental resource management,Economics,Climate change,Biodiversity,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sociology,Socio-ecological system,Social science,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Technical progress,Plant production,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant,Rural population,Public policy,Private sector,Socio-ecological system,Resource management,Psychological resilience,Stock (geology),Soil organic matter,Profitability index,Simulation modeling,Poverty,Latin Americans,Sustainable development,Resource management,Natural resource management,Terrestrial ecosystem,Greenhouse gas,Global warming","Miguel A.

660,An entropy approach to spatial disaggregation of agricultural production,2006-01-01,Agricultural Systems,10.1016/J.AGSY.2006.01.008,"Abstract While agricultural production statistics are reported on a geopolitical – often national – basis we often need to know the status of production or productivity within specific sub-regions, watersheds, or agroecological zones. Such re-aggregations are typically made using expert judgments or simple area-weighting rules. We describe a new, entropy-based approach to making spatially disaggregated assessments of the distribution of crop production. Using this approach, tabular crop production statistics are blended judiciously with an array of other secondary data to assess the production of specific crops within individual ‘pixels’ – typically 25–100 square kilometers in size. The information utilized includes crop production statistics, farming system characteristics, satellite-derived land cover data, biophysical crop suitability assessments, and population density. An application is presented in which Brazilian state level production statistics are used to generate pixel level crop production data for eight crops. To validate the spatial allocation we aggregated the pixel estimates to obtain synthetic estimates of municipality level production in Brazil, and compared those estimates with actual municipality statistics.

662,Conventionalisation of organic farming practices: from structural criteria towards an assessment based on organic principles. A review.,2009-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1051/AGRO/2009011,"Organic farming is widely perceived as being more environmentally friendly than conventional farming. As a form of sustainable agriculture, it receives substantial support from policy for its contribution to environmental protection as well as the provision of amenities such as biodiversity and cultural landscapes. Consumers are attracted to organic foods as they are produced without synthetic chemicals and comply with higher animal welfare standards. Although organic farming certainly has the potential to fulfil these expectations, studies have shown that some certified organic farms do not. Their practices comply with the regulations, but not with the principles of organic farming. This trend has been called ‘conventionalisation’ of organic farming. In this paper we review the studies that discuss the conventionalisation of organic farming, focusing on the farm level and on evidence from Europe. We argue that to strengthen organic farming’s transformative potential, the debate must move beyond its focus on the bifurcation between artisanal and conventionalised organic farms, so as to capture the full range of empirical heterogeneity. Our core argument is that to adequately understand the dynamics within organic farming and their potential impact on the ability of organic farming to fulfil the expectations of consumers and policy-makers, it is not sufficient to focus on structural changes. Instead, we need to assess whether or not the observed changes comply with the principles and values that are the fundament of organic farming.","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Organic farming,Natural resource economics,Intensive farming,Integrated farming,Ecological farming,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Process management,Survey result,Purchasing,Product (category theory),Subject matter,Policy making,Environmental resource management,Social movement,Ramification,Organic production,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Social science,Social constructionism,Occupational safety and health,Sustainability,Social science,Organic production,Sociology,Social science,Humanities","Ika Darnhofer,Thomas Lindenthal,Ruth Bartel-Kratochvil,Werner Zollitsch,Paul Maeder,Martin K. van Ittersum,Frank Ewert,Thomas Heckelei,Jacques Wery,Johanna Alkan Olsson,Susanne Padel,Carolyn Foster,David Niemeijer,Rudolf S. de Groot,Julie Guthman,Dan Rigby,D.

This conclusion has major consequences for biodiversity conservation in fragmented tropical forests and the agricultural matrices in which they are embedded. Here we make the argument that the conservation paradigm that focuses on setting aside pristine forests while ignoring the agricultural landscape is a failed strategy in light of what is now conventional wisdom in ecology. Given the fragmented nature of most tropical ecosystems, agricultural landscapes should be an essential component of any conservation strategy. We review the literature on biodiversity in tropical agricultural landscapes and present evidence that many tropical agricultural systems have high levels of biodiversity (planned and associated). These systems represent, not only habitat for biodiversity, but also a high-quality matrix that permits the movement of forest organisms among patches of natural vegetation. We review a variety of agroecosystem types and conclude that diverse, low-input systems using agroecological principles are probably the best option for a high-quality matrix. Such systems are most likely to be constructed by small farmers with land titles, who, in turn, are normally the consequence of grassroots social movements. Therefore, the new conservation paradigm should incorporate a landscape approach in which small farmers, through their social organizations, work with conservationists to create a landscape matrix dominated by productive agroecological systems that facilitate interpatch migration while promoting a sustainable and dignified livelihood for rural communities.","Metapopulation,Measurement of biodiversity,Livelihood,Grassroots,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural biodiversity,Total human ecosystem,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Unified neutral theory of biodiversity,Statistical physics,Species sorting,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat,Wildlife conservation,Land management,Habitat,Tropical climate,Pasture,Land use,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation","Ivette Perfecto,John Vandermeer,D.

However, there is little consensus as to the optimum scale for management. This is particularly acute in the agricultural environment given the level of public investment in agri-environment schemes (AES). Using a novel multiscale hierarchical sampling design, we assess the effect of land use at multiple spatial scales (from location-within-field to regions) on farmland biodiversity. We show that on-farm biodiversity components depend on farming practices (organic vs. conventional) at farm and landscape scales, but this strongly interacts with fine- and coarse-scale variables. Different taxa respond to agricultural practice at different spatial scales and often at multiple spatial scales. Hence, AES need to target multiple spatial scales to maximize effectiveness. Novel policy levers may be needed to encourage multiple land managers within a landscape to adopt schemes that create landscape-level benefits.","Organic farming,Land use,Environmental change,Ecosystem,Ecology,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Statistical theory,Statistical inference,Model selection,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,World population,Total economic value,Pollinator decline,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat,Vegetation,Terrestrial ecosystem,Soil retrogression and degradation,Sustainability,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Socioeconomics,Population,Northern lapwing,Species richness,Population density,Organic farming,Vegetation,Umbrella species,Measurement of biodiversity","Doreen Gabriel,Steven M.

665,Investing in the transition to sustainable agriculture,2015-01-01,Environmental Science & Policy,10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2015.09.013,"Abstract Ecological impacts of industrial agriculture include significant greenhouse gas emissions, loss of biodiversity, widespread pollution by fertilizers and pesticides, soil loss and degradation, declining pollinators, and human health risks, among many others. A rapidly growing body of scientific research, however, suggests that farming systems designed and managed according to ecological principles can meet the food needs of society while addressing these pressing environmental and social issues. The promise of such systems implies an urgent need for increasing the scope and scale of this area of research – agroecology. Notably, agroecological systems have been shown to reduce input dependency and therefore related research is unlikely to be supported by the private sector. Yet, the amount of federal funding available for agroecology has remained unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, we identified projects beginning in 2014 from the USDA Current Research Information System (CRIS) database and searched key sections of project reports for major components emphasizing sustainable agriculture, including agroecology. Components were grouped into four levels according to their focus on: improving system efficiency to reduce the use of inputs (L1), substituting more sustainable inputs and practices into farming systems (L2), redesigning systems based on ecological principles (L3: agroecology), or reestablishing connections between producers and consumers to support a socio-ecological transformation of the food system (L4: social dimensions of agroecology). We identified 824 projects, which accounted for $294 million dollars: just over 10% of the entire 2014 USDA Research, Extension, and Economics (REE) budget. Using a highly conservative classification protocol, we found that the primary focus of many projects was unrelated to sustainable agriculture at any level, but the majority of projects had at least one relevant component (representing 52–69% of analyzed funds, depending on whether projects focused exclusively on increasing yields were included). Of the total $294 million of analyzed funds, 18–36% went to projects that included a L1 component. Projects including components in L2, L3, or L4 received just 24%, 15%, and 14% of analyzed funds, respectively. Systems-based projects that included both agroecological farming practices (L3) and support for socioeconomic sustainability (L4) were particularly poorly funded (4%), as were L3 projects that included complex rotations (3%), spatially diversified farms (3%), rotational or regenerative grazing (1%), integrated crop-livestock systems (1%), or agroforestry (","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Private sector,Intensive farming,Food systems,Environmental resource management,Economics,Agroecology,Agroecological restoration,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Underpinning,Planetary boundaries,Planet,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Vulnerability,Political economy of climate change,Group ii,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Soil science,Population,Organic farming,Geography,Ecosystem diversity,Ecosystem,Land grabbing,Food security,Ecosystem services,Terrestrial ecosystem,Sustainable yield,Soil biodiversity,Total human ecosystem,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Environmental resource management,Sustainability,Population,Leverage (finance)","Marcia S.

One of the ways forward for agriculture currently being debated is a set of principles grouped together under the umbrella term “ecological intensification”. In published studies, ecological intensification has generally been considered to be based essentially on the use of biological regulation to manage agroecosystems, at field, farm and landscape scales. We propose here five additional avenues that agronomic research could follow to strengthen the ecological intensification of current farming systems. We begin by assuming that progress in plant sciences over the last two decades provides new insight of potential use to agronomists. Potentially useful new developments in plant science include advances in the fields of energy conversion by plants, nitrogen use efficiency and defence mechanisms against pests. We then suggest that natural ecosystems may also provide sources of inspiration for cropping system design, in terms of their structure and function on the one hand, and farmers’ knowledge on the other. Natural ecosystems display a number of interesting properties that could be incorporated into agroecosystems. We discuss the value and limitations of attempting to ‘mimic’ their structure and function, while considering the differences in objectives and constraints between these two types of system. Farmers develop extensive knowledge of the systems they manage. We discuss ways in which this knowledge could be combined with, or fed into scientific knowledge and innovation, and the extent to which this is likely to be possible. The two remaining avenues concern methods. We suggest that agronomists make more use of meta-analysis and comparative system studies, these two types of methods being commonly used in other disciplines but barely used in agronomy. Meta-analysis would make it possible to quantify variations of cropping system performances in interaction with soil and climate conditions more accurately across environments and socio-economic contexts. Comparative analysis would help to identify the structural characteristics of cropping and farming systems underlying properties of interest. Such analysis can be performed with sets of performance indicators and methods borrowed from ecology for analyses of the structure and organisation of these systems. These five approaches should make it possible to deepen our knowledge of agroecosystems for action.","Umbrella term,Sociology of scientific knowledge,Performance indicator,Ecosystem services,Cropping,Biology,Biological regulation,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Psychology,Natural language processing,Meta-analysis,Total human ecosystem,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Title,Law,Land titling,Reactive nitrogen,Nitrogen cycle,Industrial production,Socio-ecological system,Social system,Social ecology,Vegetation,Trait,Specific leaf area,Symbiosis,Root microbiome,Rhizosphere,Study heterogeneity,Random effects model,Publication bias,Zoology,Trophic level,Species richness,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource","Thierry Doré,David Makowski,Eric Malézieux,Nathalie Munier-Jolain,Marc Tchamitchian,Pablo Tittonell,Michael Borenstein,Larry V.

Different notions of the qualifiers of intensification (ecological, sustainable, durable, etc.) need to be unpacked. This paper examines conceptual differences between sustainable and ecological intensification as used in research, development, policy and the industry, particularly with respect to the balance between agriculture and nature. The study compares different discourses on models of intensification that differ in the role nature plays in the actual design of the systems. While sustainable intensification is generally loosely defined, so that almost any model or technology can be labeled under it, ecological intensification proposes landscape approaches that make smart use of the natural functionalities that ecosystems offer. The aim is to design multifunctional agroecosystems that are both sustained by nature and sustainable in their nature.","Sustainability,Organic farming,Land use,Food security,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Economics,Agroecology,Agriculture,Adaptive management,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Total human ecosystem,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Species diversity,Short interval,Paleontology,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Soil science,Population,Organic farming,Tourism,Total human ecosystem,Provisioning,Sustainable agriculture,Soil conservation,Integrated pest management","Pablo Tittonell,H.

The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a component of the tight junction and is inaccessible to virus approaching from the apical surface. Many CVBs also interact with the GPI-anchored protein decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Here, we report that virus attachment to DAF on the apical cell surface activates Abl kinase, triggering Rac-dependent actin rearrangements that permit virus movement to the tight junction. Within the junction, interaction with CAR promotes conformational changes in the virus capsid that are essential for virus entry and release of viral RNA. Interaction with DAF also activates Fyn kinase, an event that is required for the phosphorylation of caveolin and transport of virus into the cell within caveolar vesicles. CVBs thus exploit DAF-mediated signaling pathways to surmount the epithelial barrier.","Virus,Viral entry,Tight junction,Signal transduction,FYN,Coxsackievirus,Cell biology,Caveolin,Biology,ABL,Tyrosine kinase,SH3 domain,Receptor tyrosine kinase,Virology,Viral replication,Viral pathogenesis,Membrane raft,Membrane lipids,Membrane,ZAP70,Tyrosine-protein kinase CSK,Src family kinase,Tight junction,Septate junctions,Paracellular transport,Vesicle,Potocytosis,Membrane contact site,Rac3,Rac GTP-Binding Proteins,RHOA,Restriction site,RNA splicing,Polymerase chain reaction,Receptor-mediated endocytosis,Kinase,Endocytosis,Virology,Viral replication,Picornaviridae","Carolyn B.

We first define Diversified Farming Systems (DFS) as farming practices and landscapes that intentionally include functional biodiversity at multiple spatial and/or temporal scales in order to maintain ecosystem services that provide critical inputs to agriculture, such as soil fertility, pest and disease control, water use efficiency, and pollination. We explore to what extent DFS overlap or are differentiated from existing concepts such as sustainable, multifunctional, organic or ecoagriculture. DFS are components of social-ecological systems that depend on certain combinations of traditional and contemporary knowledge, cultures, practices, and governance structures. Further, as ecosystem services are generated and regenerated within a DFS, the resulting social benefits in turn support the maintenance of the DFS, enhancing its ability to provision these services sustainably. We explore how social institutions, particularly alternative agri-food networks and agrarian movements, may serve to promote DFS approaches, but note that such networks and movements have other primary goals and are not always explicitly connected to the environmental and agroecological concerns embodied within the DFS concept. We examine global trends in agriculture to investigate to what extent industrialized forms of agriculture are replacing former DFS, assess the current and potential contributions of DFS to food security, food sovereignty and the global food supply, and determine where and under what circumstances DFS are expanding rather than contracting. © 2012 by the author(s).","Sustainability,Food systems,Food sovereignty,Food security,Environmental resource management,Environmental planning,Ecosystem services,Economics,Ecoagriculture,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Population,Organic farming,Food systems,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Geography,Water-use efficiency,Sustainability,Poverty,Pollination,Landscape ecology,Habitat,Vegetation,Understory,Species richness,Sustainability,Industrialisation,Food systems,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Principles of Organic Agriculture,Integrated farming,Sustainability,Politics,Political economy,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Sustainability","Claire Kremen,Alastair Iles,Christopher M.

We suggest that trait values should be measured across environmental conditions and agricultural management regimes to predict how ecosystem services vary with farm practices and environment.

672,How to implement biodiversity-based agriculture to enhance ecosystem services: a review,2015-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-015-0306-1,"Intensive agriculture has led to several drawbacks such as biodiversity loss, climate change, erosion, and pollution of air and water. A potential solution is to implement management practices that increase the level of provision of ecosystem services such as soil fertility and biological regulation. There is a lot of literature on the principles of agroecology. However, there is a gap of knowledge between agroecological principles and practical applications. Therefore, we review here agroecological and management sciences to identify two facts that explain the lack of practical applications: (1) the occurrence of high uncertainties about relations between agricultural practices, ecological processes, and ecosystem services, and (2) the site-specific character of agroecological practices required to deliver expected ecosystem services. We also show that an adaptive-management approach, focusing on planning and monitoring, can serve as a framework for developing and implementing learning tools tailored for biodiversity-based agriculture. Among the current learning tools developed by researchers, we identify two main types of emergent support tools likely to help design diversified farming systems and landscapes: (1) knowledge bases containing scientific supports and experiential knowledge and (2) model-based games. These tools have to be coupled with well-tailored field or management indicators that allow monitoring effects of practices on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Finally, we propose a research agenda that requires bringing together contributions from agricultural, ecological, management, and knowledge management sciences, and asserts that researchers have to take the position of “integration and implementation sciences.”","Sustainable development,Functional ecology,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Ecosystem management,Biology,Biological regulation,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agroecological restoration,Adaptive management,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Species richness,Natural resource economics,Humanity,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Impact factor,Human welfare,Environmental resource management,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Valuation (finance),Total economic value,Natural resource management,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Scholarship","Michel Duru,Olivier Therond,Guillaume Martin,Roger Martin-Clouaire,Robert Costanza,Rudolf de Groot,Stephen Farberk,Monica Grasso,Bruce Hannon,H.

With food shortages and increased threats of climate change, interest in agroforestry is gathering for its potential to address various on-farm adaptation needs, and fulfill many roles in AFOLU-related mitigation pathways. Agroforestry provides assets and income from carbon, wood energy, improved soil fertility and enhancement of local climate conditions; it provides ecosystem services and reduces human impacts on natural forests. Most of these benefits have direct benefits for local adaptation while contributing to global efforts to control atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. This paper presents recent findings on how agroforestry as a sustainable practice helps to achieve both mitigation and adaptation objectives while remaining relevant to the livelihoods of the poor smallholder farmers in Africa.","Water use,Local adaptation,Livelihood,Land use,Greenhouse gas,Ecosystem services,Economics,Climate change,Agroforestry,Agroecology,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Yield gap,Sustainability,Population growth,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Greenhouse gas,Food systems,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Sustainability,Productive capacity,Primary production,Vegetation,Tropics,Tropical vegetation,Terrestrial ecosystem,Greenhouse gas,Global warming,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Food systems,Tropics,Tropical agriculture,Subsistence agriculture,Water resources,Precipitation,Plateau","Cheikh Mbow,Pete Smith,David Skole,Lalisa Duguma,Mercedes Bustamante,R.

674,Reframing the land‐sparing/land‐sharing debate for biodiversity conservation,2015-01-01,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,10.1111/NYAS.12845,"Author(s): Kremen, Claire | Abstract: Conservation biologists are devoting an increasing amount of energy to debating whether land sparing (high-yielding agriculture on a small land footprint) or land sharing (low-yielding, wildlife-friendly agriculture on a larger land footprint) will promote better outcomes for local and global biodiversity. In turn, concerns are mounting about how to feed the world, given increasing demands for food. In this review, I evaluate the land-sparing/land-sharing framework--does the framework stimulate research and policy that can reconcile agricultural land use with biodiversity conservation, or is a revised framing needed? I review (1) the ecological evidence in favor of sparing versus sharing; (2) the evidence from land-use change studies that assesses whether a relationship exists between agricultural intensification and land sparing; and (3) how that relationship may be affected by socioeconomic and political factors. To address the trade-off between biodiversity conservation and food production, I then ask which forms of agricultural intensification can best feed the world now and in the future. On the basis of my review, I suggest that the dichotomy of the land-sparing/land-sharing framework limits the realm of future possibilities to two, largely undesirable, options for conservation. Both large, protected regions and favorable surrounding matrices are needed to promote biodiversity conservation; they work synergistically and are not mutually exclusive. A ""both-and"" framing of large protected areas surrounded by a wildlife-friendly matrix suggests different research priorities from the ""either-or"" framing of sparing versus sharing. Furthermore, wildlife-friendly farming methods such as agroecology may be best adapted to provide food for the world's hungry people.","Natural resource economics,Land footprint,Immunology,Global biodiversity,Framing (construction),Food sovereignty,Environmental resource management,Biology,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural land,Agricultural biodiversity,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Sustainable development,Poverty,Food security,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Social network,Social capital,Learning environment,Sustainable seafood,Sustainability,Overexploitation,Tragedy of the commons,Sustainability,Psychological resilience,Urbanization,Sustainability,Public health,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Yield gap,Sustainability,Population growth,Tropical climate,Sustainability,Species diversity","Claire Kremen,David Tilman,Christian Balzer,Jason Hill,Belinda L.

Transdermal (TD) delivery provides an excellent alternative, but the barrier of skin's outer stratum corneum (SC) prevents delivery of most drugs. Micrometer-scale microneedles (MNs) have been used to pierce animal and human cadaver skin and thereby enable TD delivery of small molecules, proteins, DNA, and vaccines for systemic action. Here, we present a clinical study of MN-enhanced delivery of a medication to humans. Naltrexone (NTX) is a potent mu-opioid receptor antagonist used to treat opiate and alcohol dependence. This hydrophilic and skin-impermeant molecule was delivered from a TD patch to healthy human subjects with and without pretreatment of the skin with MNs. Whereas delivery from a standard NTX TD patch over a 72-h period yielded undetectable drug plasma levels, pretreatment of skin with MNs achieved steady-state plasma concentrations within 2 h of patch application and were maintained for at least 48 h. The MNs and NTX patch were well tolerated with mild systemic and application site side effects. The MN arrays were painless upon administration and not damaged during skin insertion, and no MNs were broken off into the skin. This human proof-of-concept study demonstrates systemic administration of a hydrophilic medication by MN-enhanced TD delivery. These findings set the stage for future human studies of skin-impermeant medications and biopharmaceuticals for clinical applications.","Transdermal,Systemic administration,Stratum corneum,Pharmacology,Naltrexone,Medicine,Drug delivery,Drug,Bioavailability,Absorption (skin),Surgery,Randomized controlled trial,Randomization,Transdermal,Surface coating,Pharmacology,Transdermal,Sonophoresis,Pharmacology,Wound healing,Transforming growth factor,Myofibroblast,Transport studies,Transdermal,Polymer,Vitamin b,Transdermal,Plasmid dna,Transdermal,Surgery,Medicine,Transdermal,Surface micromachining,Reactive-ion etching,Transdermal,Pharmacology,Pharmacokinetics,Skin irritation,Skin barrier function,Skin barrier","Daniel P.

We demonstrate that ∼10% of integrations of a lentivirally encoded β-globin transgene in β-thalassemia-patient iPS cell clones meet our safe harbor criteria and permit high-level β-globin expression upon erythroid differentiation without perturbation of neighboring gene expression.

682,Strategies and agronomic interventions to improve the phosphorus-use efficiency of farming systems,2011-01-01,Plant and Soil,10.1007/S11104-011-0880-1,"Phosphorus (P)-deficiency is a significant challenge for agricultural productivity on many highly P-sorbing weathered and tropical soils throughout the world. On these soils it can be necessary to apply up to five-fold more P as fertiliser than is exported in products. Given the finite nature of global P resources, it is important that such inefficiencies be addressed. For low P-sorbing soils, P-efficient farming systems will also assist attempts to reduce pollution associated with P losses to the environment. P-balance inefficiency of farms is associated with loss of P in erosion, runoff or leaching, uneven dispersal of animal excreta, and accumulation of P as sparingly-available phosphate and organic P in the soil. In many cases it is possible to minimise P losses in runoff or erosion. Uneven dispersal of P in excreta typically amounts to ~5% of P-fertiliser inputs. However, the rate of P accumulation in moderate to highly P-sorbing soils is a major contributor to inefficient P-fertiliser use. We discuss the causal edaphic, plant and microbial factors in the context of soil P management, P cycling and productivity goals of farms. Management interventions that can alter P-use efficiency are explored, including better targeted P-fertiliser use, organic amendments, removing other constraints to yield, zone management, use of plants with low critical-P requirements, and modified farming systems. Higher productivity in low-P soils, or lower P inputs in fertilised agricultural systems can be achieved by various interventions, but it is also critically important to understand the agroecology of plant P nutrition within farming systems for improvements in P-use efficiency to be realised.","Surface runoff,Soil water,Soil fertility,Inefficiency,Edaphic,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Scarcity,Phosphorus,Phosphorite,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Soil fertility,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Remote sensing,Poison control,Photochemical Reflectance Index,Soil water,Soil structure,Soil organic matter,Topsoil,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil fertility,Rhizosphere,Phosphorus,Microbial inoculant,Woody plant,Vegetation,Soil carbon,Total organic carbon,Soil water,Soil texture,Vicia faba,Rhizosphere,Phosphorus","Richard J.

The disease can also be induced by the transfer of encephalitogenic CD4+ T helper (TH) lymphocytes into naive mice. These T cells need to re-encounter their cognate antigen in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II–bearing antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in order to recognize their target. The cell type and location of the APC mediating T-cell entry into the central nervous system (CNS) remain unknown. Here, we show that APCs of the lymphoreticular system and of the CNS parenchyma are dispensable for the immune invasion of the CNS. We also describe that a discrete population of vessel-associated dendritic cells (DCs) is present in human brain tissue. In mice, CD11c+ DCs alone are sufficient to present antigen in vivo to primed myelin-reactive T cells in order to mediate CNS inflammation and clinical disease development.","Virology,Multiple sclerosis,Major histocompatibility complex,Immunology,Immune system,Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,Cytotoxic T cell,Biology,Antigen-presenting cell,Antigen presentation,Antigen,T helper 17 cell,Interleukin 23,Interleukin 12,ZAP70,Natural killer T cell,Molecular biology,Molecular biology,Immunology,Follicular dendritic cells,Proinflammatory cytokine,Microglia,Medicine,Virology,T-cell receptor,T cell,Neuroscience,Myelin,Multiple sclerosis,TRAF1,Signal transduction,Receptor,T lymphocyte,Microglia,Immunology,T cell,Molecular biology,MHC class II,Neuroinflammation,Myelin basic protein,Molecular biology","Melanie Greter,Frank L Heppner,Maria P Lemos,Bernhard M Odermatt,Norbert Goebels,Terri Laufer,Randolph J Noelle,Burkhard Becher,Daniel J.

684,Prospects from agroecology and industrial ecology for animal production in the 21st century,2013-01-01,Animal,10.1017/S1751731112002418,"Agroecology and industrial ecology can be viewed as complementary means for reducing the environmental footprint of animal farming systems: agroecology mainly by stimulating natural processes to reduce inputs, and industrial ecology by closing system loops, thereby reducing demand for raw materials, lowering pollution and saving on waste treatment. Surprisingly, animal farming systems have so far been ignored in most agroecological thinking. On the basis of a study by Altieri, who identified the key ecological processes to be optimized, we propose five principles for the design of sustainable animal production systems: (i) adopting management practices aiming to improve animal health, (ii) decreasing the inputs needed for production, (iii) decreasing pollution by optimizing the metabolic functioning of farming systems, (iv) enhancing diversity within animal production systems to strengthen their resilience and (v) preserving biological diversity in agroecosystems by adapting management practices. We then discuss how these different principles combine to generate environmental, social and economic performance in six animal production systems (ruminants, pigs, rabbits and aquaculture) covering a long gradient of intensification. The two principles concerning economy of inputs and reduction of pollution emerged in nearly all the case studies, a finding that can be explained by the economic and regulatory constraints affecting animal production. Integrated management of animal health was seldom mobilized, as alternatives to chemical drugs have only recently been investigated, and the results are not yet transferable to farming practices. A number of ecological functions and ecosystem services (recycling of nutrients, forage yield, pollination, resistance to weed invasion, etc.) are closely linked to biodiversity, and their persistence depends largely on maintaining biological diversity in agroecosystems. We conclude that the development of such ecology-based alternatives for animal production implies changes in the positions adopted by technicians and extension services, researchers and policymakers.

685,Variability in plant nutrients reduces insect herbivore performance,2016-01-01,Nature,10.1038/NATURE20140,"Variation in plant nutrient levels suppresses insect herbivore populations and the homogenous nutrient content of modern agricultural crops could be contributing to insect pest outbreaks. The nutritive and defensive traits of plants influence the performance of insect herbivores. Whether variability in these traits also has a bearing on herbivore performance is less clear. In this meta-analysis, William Wetzel and colleagues show that variation in plant nutrient levels substantially reduces mean herbivore performance. The finding suggests that the homogenous nutrient content of modern agricultural crops could be contributing to insect pest outbreaks. The performance and population dynamics of insect herbivores depend on the nutritive and defensive traits of their host plants1. The literature on plant–herbivore interactions focuses on plant trait mean values2,3,4, but recent studies showing the importance of plant genetic diversity for herbivores suggest that plant trait variance may be equally important5,6. The consequences of plant trait variance for herbivore performance, however, have been largely overlooked. Here we report an extensive assessment of the effects of within-population plant trait variance on herbivore performance using 457 performance datasets from 53 species of insect herbivores. We show that variance in plant nutritive traits substantially reduces mean herbivore performance via non-linear averaging of performance relationships that were overwhelmingly concave down. By contrast, relationships between herbivore performance and plant defence levels were typically linear, with variance in plant defence not affecting herbivore performance via non-linear averaging. Our results demonstrate that plants contribute to the suppression of herbivore populations through variable nutrient levels, not just by having low average quality as is typically thought. We propose that this phenomenon could play a key role in the suppression of herbivore populations in natural systems, and that increased nutrient heterogeneity within agricultural crops could contribute to the sustainable control of insect pests in agroecosystems.","Population,Plant tolerance to herbivory,Nutrient,Herbivore,Ecology,Community,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Statistics,Smoothing spline,Restricted maximum likelihood,Mixed effects,Geography,Applied mathematics,Mixed model,Mathematics,Mathematical optimization,Variance estimation,Statistics,Regression,Trait,Natural population growth,Intraspecific competition,Paddy field,Oryza sativa,Monoculture,Species richness,Species diversity,Plant diversity,Zoology,Predation,Population,Software,Missing data,Meta-analysis,Toxicology,Pharmacology,Medicine","William C.

688,Biodiversity conservation in agriculture requires a multi-scale approach,2014-01-01,Proceedings of The Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,10.1098/RSPB.2014.1358,"Biodiversity loss—one of the most prominent forms of modern environmental change—has been heavily driven by terrestrial habitat loss and, in particular, the spread and intensification of agriculture. Expanding agricultural land-use has led to the search for strong conservation strategies, with some suggesting that biodiversity conservation in agriculture is best maximized by reducing local management intensity, such as fertilizer and pesticide application. Others highlight the importance of landscape-level approaches that incorporate natural or semi-natural areas in landscapes surrounding farms. Here, we show that both of these practices are valuable to the conservation of biodiversity, and that either local or landscape factors can be most crucial to conservation planning depending on which types of organisms one wishes to save. We performed a quantitative review of 266 observations taken from 31 studies that compared the impacts of localized (within farm) management strategies and landscape complexity (around farms) on the richness and abundance of plant, invertebrate and vertebrate species in agro-ecosystems. While both factors significantly impacted species richness, the richness of sessile plants increased with less-intensive local management, but did not significantly respond to landscape complexity. By contrast, the richness of mobile vertebrates increased with landscape complexity, but did not significantly increase with less-intensive local management. Invertebrate richness and abundance responded to both factors. Our analyses point to clear differences in how various groups of organisms respond to differing scales of management, and suggest that preservation of multiple taxonomic groups will require multiple scales of conservation.","Taxonomic rank,Sustainable agriculture,Species richness,Organic farming,Habitat destruction,Environmental science,Ecology,Biodiversity,Agroecology,Agriculture,Psychology,Natural language processing,Meta-analysis,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Species richness,Natural resource economics,Humanity,Population,Nitrogen cycle,Global change,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Global change,Global biodiversity,Valuation (finance),Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Taxon,Species richness,Species diversity,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Total human ecosystem,Species diversity,Geography","David J.

689,Biomass Production and Carbon/Nitrogen Ratio Influence Ecosystem Services from Cover Crop Mixtures,2015-01-01,Agronomy Journal,10.2134/AGRONJ15.0182,"39 Ecosystem services are the benefi ts ecosystems off er to humans such as providing food and energy, regulating water quality, and supporting nutrient cycling (Millenium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). Increasing ecosystem services from agriculture is essential to meeting the needs of a growing global population while mitigating environmental degradation (Foley et al., 2011). One potential strategy to augment services from row crops is to increase plant diversity (Robertson et al., 2014). For example, diverse crop rotations can increase key services such as yield and water quality improvement (Tonitto et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2008). Although spatial diversity through intercropping also has the potential to increase services (Vandermeer, 1989), applications of this strategy for row crops may have limited feasibility due to management constraints and possible impacts on yield. Cover crops, which are grown during otherwise fallow periods of a crop rotation, may present opportunities to increase both temporal and spatial plant diversity and, consequently, increase ecosystem services in agronomic systems. In this paper, we measure ecosystem services associated with multi-species cover crop mixtures in a corn (Zea mays L.)-small grain rotation and identify cover crop characteristics that infl uence service provision. Cover crops are increasingly recognized as a critical piece of sustainable agronomic production based on their ability to enhance farm productivity while reducing environmental risks (Snapp et al., 2005; Schipanski et al., 2014). Multi-species cover crop mixtures have been proposed as a strategy to augment services from cover crops, in part due to expected increases in biomass production from mixtures (Creamer et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2014). Expectations of higher productivity are based on extensive research in natural ecosystems demonstrating that increasing plant diversity leads to greater primary production (Hooper et al., 2005; Cardinale et al., 2011). Whether this relationship holds for cover cropping systems is largely unexplored, and there are important contrasts between agronomic and natural systems that may limit the eff ects of diversity on cover crop productivity. Cover crops are annual species grown for a short time period, while the natural systems in which the diversity productivity relationship has been studied include perennial species and consider productivity over several years (Tilman et al., 2006; Marquard et al., 2009).

690,SRI as a methodology for raising crop and water productivity: productive adaptations in rice agronomy and irrigation water management,2011-01-01,Paddy and Water Environment,10.1007/S10333-010-0224-4,"The System of Rice Intensification (SRI), developed in Madagascar almost 30 years ago, modifies certain practices for managing plants, soil, water, and nutrients with the effect of raising the productivity of the land, labor, and capital devoted to rice production. Certain production inputs are reduced—seeds, inorganic fertilizer, water, and fuel where water is pumped—with increased yield as a result. This paper introduces the subject of SRI, which is then addressed variously in the articles that follow. SRI is gaining interest and application in over 40 countries around the world. Its practices make soil conditions more aerobic and promote greater root growth, as well as larger, more diverse communities of beneficial soil biota. These below-ground changes support more productive phenotypes above-ground for practically all rice genotypes (cultivars) tested so far, with supportive evidence accumulating both from scientific institutions and field applications. SRI methodology remains controversial in some circles, however, because of the transformational change it introductions into traditional lowland rice production systems. This issue of PAWE brings together the results of formal research on SRI in a number of countries (Part I) and also reports on initiatives by government agencies, NGOs, universities, or the private sector, bringing knowledge of SRI to farmers in a wide range of agroecological circumstances (Part II). This introduction presents the basic principles that underlie SRI and discusses the nature of this innovation as well as considers some of the issues in contention. SRI continues to evolve and expand, being a work in progress. Its concepts and methods are being extended also to upland (rainfed) rice production, as well to other crops. Accordingly, SRI should not be regarded or evaluated in conventional terms as if it were a typical component technology. It is understood more appropriately in terms of a paradigm shift for rice production. In particular, it calls into question the long-standing belief that rice is best produced under continuously flooded conditions.","System of Rice Intensification,Private sector,Paradigm shift,Hydrology,Government,Economics,Crop,Best practice,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Soil organic matter,System of Rice Intensification,Sustainable agriculture,Rural area,System of Rice Intensification,Soil fertility,Oryza sativa,Yield risk,System of Rice Intensification,Risk aversion,Weed control,Tropics,System of Rice Intensification,Water resource management,Tamil,System of Rice Intensification,System of Rice Intensification,Natural resource,Management system,System of Rice Intensification,Sri lanka,Odds,World population,Poaceae,Oryza,Transplanting,Transplantation,Time saving","Norman Uphoff,Amir Kassam,Richard Harwood,Norman Thomas Uphoff,Christine M Moser,Christopher B Barrett,A Dobermann,Christopher B.

691,Benefits of increasing plant diversity in sustainable agroecosystems,2017-01-01,Journal of Ecology,10.1111/1365-2745.12789,"Summary Recent studies have revealed many potential benefits of increasing plant diversity in natural ecosystems, as well as in agroecosystems and production forests. Plant diversity potentially provides a partial to complete substitute for many costly agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, imported pollinators and irrigation. Diversification strategies include enhancing crop genetic diversity, mixed plantings, rotating crops, agroforestry and diversifying landscapes surrounding croplands. Here we briefly review studies considering how increasing plant diversity influences the production of crops, forage, and wood, yield stability, and several regulating and supporting agroecosystem services. We also discuss challenges and recommendations for diversifying agroecosystems. There is consistently strong evidence that strategically increasing plant diversity increases crop and forage yield, wood production, yield stability, pollinators, weed suppression and pest suppression, whereas effects of diversification on soil nutrients and carbon remain poorly understood. Synthesis. The benefits of diversifying agroecosystems are expected to be greatest where the aims are to sustainably intensify production while reducing conventional inputs or to optimize both yields and ecosystem services. Over the next few decades, as monoculture yields continue to decelerate or decline for many crops, and as demand for ecosystem services continues to rise, diversification could become an essential tool for sustaining production and ecosystem services in croplands, rangelands and production forests.","Wood production,Sustainability,Monoculture,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Ecological stability,Botany,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Species richness,Natural resource economics,Humanity,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Soil fertility,Negative carbon dioxide emission,Monoculture,Greenhouse gas,Species richness,Rarefaction,Land use,Total human ecosystem,Resource management,Natural resource,Species richness,Species diversity,Global warming,Total human ecosystem,Measurement of biodiversity,Environmental resource management","Forest Isbell,Paul R.

Agroecology transcends the reformist notion of organic agriculture and sustainable intensification proponents who contend that changes can be achieved within the dominant agroindustrial system with minor adjustments or “greening” of the current neoliberal agricultural model. In the technological realm, merely modifying practices to reduce input use is a step in the right direction but does not necessarily lead to the redesign of a more self sufficient and autonomous farming system. A true agroecological technological conversion calls into question monoculture and the dependency on external inputs. Traditional farming systems provide models that promote biodiversity, thrive without agrochemicals, and sustain year-round yields.

695,Functional biodiversity: An agroecosystem approach,2008-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2008.02.013,"Abstract Research and policies aimed at biodiversity conservation in agricultural ecosystems are often less successful than expected. One common assumption is that more research is needed to develop improved measures and indicators of biodiversity. The authors’ opinion is that this is only partly true and that most of the problems arise from the lack of a well-focussed approach to this subject. Based on the knowledge available in the scientific literature, a methodological framework was developed which can help researchers and policy makers to think in a better, more structured way about issues related to biodiversity conservation in a given agroecosystem. In order to frame the importance of biodiversity in agroecosystems, three main questions were addressed through literature search: (1) What does biodiversity mean in natural and agricultural ecosystems? (2) How is the concept of functionality used in relation to biodiversity? (3) Which biodiversity measures are currently used to express agriculture–biodiversity relationships? Analysis of the literature resulted in a framework consisting of three steps. At first the objectives of biodiversity research and policies have to be defined. Three options can be foreseen here: (a) species, community, habitat or overall biodiversity conservation regardless of its functions, (b) biodiversity conservation to attain production and environmental protection services, and (c) use of bio-indicators for agroecosystem monitoring. In the second step the appropriate target elements for conservation have to be chosen based on an agroecosystem approach, and in the third step adequate biodiversity measures of composition, structure and function have to be selected for each target element. Functional biodiversity is important in relation to the provision of specific agroecosystem services. The study of functional biodiversity should start with the definition of agroecosystem functional groups comprising all elements that interact with the desired service, and the consequent determination of the role of diversity within these functional groups for the fulfilment of the agroecosystem service. Therefore a more precise definition of ‘functional biodiversity’ would be “that part of the total biodiversity composed of clusters of elements (at the gene, species or habitat level) providing the same (agro)ecosystem service, that is driven by within-cluster diversity”.","Scientific literature,Measurement of biodiversity,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Ecosystem health,Ecosystem,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Total human ecosystem,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Species discovery curve,Relative abundance distribution,Ecology,Species richness,Species diversity,Nature Conservation,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Total human ecosystem,Species diversity,Geography,Sustainability,Species richness,Species diversity,Vegetation,Species diversity,Global biodiversity,Terrestrial ecosystem,Species richness,Species diversity,Wildlife conservation,Species richness,Landscape-scale conservation","Anna-Camilla Moonen,Paolo Bàrberi,Robert Costanza,Rudolf de Groot,Stephen Farberk,Monica Grasso,Bruce Hannon,D.

It is unclear why some serotypes can persist at all: They are more easily cleared from carriage and compete poorly in vivo. Serotype-specific immune responses, which could promote diversity in principle, are weak enough to allow repeated colonizations by the same type. We show that weak serotype-specific immunity and an acquired response not specific to the capsule can together reproduce observed diversity.

We attempt to extend and preview agroecology as a discipline in which agriculture can be conceptualized within the context of global change and studied as a coupled system involving a wide range of social and natural processes. This intrinsic coupling, combined with powerful emerging drivers of change, presents challenges for the practice of agroecology and agriculture itself, as well as providing the framework for some of the most innovative research areas and the greatest potential for innovation for a sustainable future in agriculture. The objective of this review is to identify forward-looking scientific questions to enhance the relevance of agroecology for the key challenges of mitigating environmental impacts of agriculture while dramatically increasing global food production, improving livelihoods, and thereby reducing chronic hunger and malnutrition over the coming decades.","Psychological resilience,Livelihood,Instrumental and intrinsic value,Global change,Environmental resource management,Economics,Ecology,Agroecology,Agroecological restoration,Agriculture,Agricultural biodiversity,Theoretical computer science,The Internet,Social network,Regional science,Environmental science,Cross sectoral,Second-generation biofuels,Low-carbon fuel standard,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sociology,Social contract,Rationality,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Sustainability,Radiative forcing,Planetary boundaries,Reactive nitrogen,Nitrogen cycle,Industrial production,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Valuation (finance),Total human ecosystem,Sustainability","Thomas P.

The evidence reviewed here suggests that alternative approaches can achieve high crop yields and profits, but the performance of other socioeconomic indicators (as well as long-term trends) is surprisingly poorly documented. Consequently, the implementation of conventional intensification and the discussion of alternative approaches are not based on quantitative evidence of their simultaneous ecological and socioeconomic impacts across the globe. To close this knowledge gap, we propose a participatory assessment framework. Given the impacts of conventional intensification on biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions, such evidence is urgently needed to direct science-policy initiatives, such as the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.","Sustainable development,Livelihood,Greenhouse gas,Food security,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainable development,Indian ocean,Geography,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Underweight,Percentile,Overweight obesity,Organic farming,Business,Agroforestry,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Urbanization,Rural sociology,Rural economics,Soil science,Population,Organic farming,Sustainability,Management science,Knowledge-based systems","Lucas A.

699,Organic Agriculture 3.0 is innovation with research,2017-01-01,Organic agriculture,10.1007/S13165-016-0171-5,"Organic agriculture can and should play an important role in solving future challenges in producing food. The low level of external inputs combined with knowledge on sustainablity minimizes environmental contamination and can help to produce more food for more people without negatively impacting our environment. Organic agriculture not only includes farming as a production practice but it also includes processing, trade and consumption. Nevertheless, Organic agriculture must always evolve to overcome emerging challenges. Science-based knowledge attained through dedicated research is required to strengthen organic food and farming as a means to solve future challenges. In 2010, a global discussion about Organic 3.0 was initiated to address current problems our agri-food systems are facing. Many scientifically and practically proven results are already available to make organic agriculture a strong tool to solve some of these challenges. However, the organic agri-food system has to be developed further to fulfill its potential. The contribution of organic agriculture to help solve current problems linked to food security and environmental quality was discussed during the International Society of Organic Agricultural Research (ISOFAR) Symposium “Organic 3.0 is Innovation with Research”, held September 20–22, 2015, in conjunction with the first ISOFAR International Organic Expo, in Goesan County, Republic of Korea. Some of the world’s most active scientists in organic agriculture attended the symposium. This paper is a result of their discussions and aims to give an overview of research conducted and required to strengthen organic agriculture in its ambitions to overcome agronomic challenges, contribute to food security and protect our common environment.","Sustainable development,Sustainability,Organic farming,Food systems,Food security,Environmental quality,Environmental planning,Business,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Years of potential life lost,Surgery,Public health,Planetary boundaries,Humanity,Fresh water,Young adult,Underweight,Surgery,Visual arts,Upcycling,Reuse,Social adjustment,Mental health,Medicine,Geography,Food waste,Food systems,Sustainability,Statistics,Principles of Organic Agriculture,Organic farming,Business,Agroforestry,Summit,Population,Nationality,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Rural poverty","Gerold Rahmann,M.

700,Organic farming : Its relevance to the Indian context,2004-01-01,Current Science,,"Increasing consciousness about conservation of environment as well as health hazards associated with agrochemicals and consumers' preference to safe and hazard-free food are the major factors that lead to the growing interest in alternate forms of agriculture in the world. Organic agriculture is one among the broad spectrum of production methods that are supportive of the environment. The demand for organic food is steadily increasing both in the developed and developing countries with an annual average growth rate of 20-25%. Organic agriculture, without doubt, is one of the fastest-growing sectors of agricultural production. However, there are certain issues that should be clarified before we go for a large-scale conversion to organic agriculture. The most important issues are -Can organic farming produce enough food for everybody? Is it possible to meet the nutrient requirements of crops entirely from organic sources? Are there any significant environmental benefits that accrue from organic farming? Is the food produced by organic farming superior in quality? Is it economically feasible? In this article, we review these aspects of organic farming. In India, vast stretches of arable land, which are mainly rain-fed and found in the Northeastern region where negligible amount of fertilizers and pesticides are being used and have low productivity, could be exploited as potential areas for organic agriculture. Considering the potential environmental benefits of organic production and its compatibility with integrated agricultural approaches to rural development, organic agriculture may be considered as a development vehicle for developing countries like India, in particular.","Organic farming,Natural farming,Mixed farming,Intensive crop farming,Integrated farming,Ecological farming,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Soil quality,Wine,Pesticide residue,Pesticide,Zero Budget Farming,Natural farming,Mixed farming,Organic farming,Intensive farming,Integrated farming,Zoonotic Infection,Water quality,Toxicology,Symbiosis,Sustainable agriculture,Rhizosphere,Sustainable agriculture,Organic farming,Business,Weed control,Vicia villosa,Tillage,Toxicology,Soil contamination,Soil biology,Water pollution,Pollution index,Pollution","P.

701,"Conservation agriculture cropping systems in temperate and tropical conditions, performances and impacts. A review",2012-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-012-0106-9,"Nowadays, in a context of climate change, economical uncertainties and social pressure to mitigate agriculture externalities, farmers have to adopt new cropping systems to achieve a sustainable and cost-effective grain production. Conservation agriculture consists of a range of cropping systems based on a combination of three main principles: (1) soil tillage reduction, (2) soil protection by organic residues and (3) diversification in crop rotation. Conservation agriculture has been promoted as a way to reduce production costs, soil erosion and soil fertility degradation under both tropical and temperate conditions. Conservation agriculture-based cropping systems have diffused widely under Brazilian large-scale farms’ conditions and more recently in Europe in the context of medium-size mechanized farms. Their diffusion, however, is still limited under small-scale non-mechanized farms’ conditions of tropical countries. To assess the advantages and limits of such new cropping systems, this article compares experiences with conservation agriculture from the tropical Cerrado region of Brazil and from temperate conditions of Europe. It focusses on agronomic performances, environmental impacts and economical results. Conservation agriculture systems appear to be interesting options to achieve sustainable and intensive crop production under different agroecological environments because they use efficiently available resources and maintain soil fertility. However, this mostly results from the permanent presence of an organic mulch on the soil surface and the incorporation of cover crops in the rotations. Such modifications require a significant reorganization of the production process at farm level, and when facing technical or socioeconomic constraints, most farmers usually opt for applying only partially the three main principles of conservation agriculture. Investigating more fully the consequences of such partial implementation of conservation agriculture principles on its actual efficiency and assessing the most efficient participatory approaches needed to adapt conservation agriculture principles to local conditions and farming systems are top priorities for future research.","Sustainable development,Soil fertility,Cropping,Crop rotation,Cover crop,Conservation agriculture,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Spatial ecology,Soil structure,Soil science,Sustainability,No-till farming,Natural farming,Temperate climate,Soil water,Soil structure,Soil water,Soil science,Soil organic matter,Tillage,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil organic matter,Soil structure,Soil organic matter,Soil carbon,Threatened species,Table (landform),Mountain range,Surface runoff,Soil structure,Soil organic matter,Tropics,Tropical agriculture,Nitrogen fixation","Eric Scopel,Bernard Triomphe,François Affholder,Fernando Antonio Macena Da Silva,Marc Corbeels,José Humberto Valadares Xavier,Rabah Lahmar,Sylvie Recous,Martial Bernoux,Eric Blanchart,Ieda de Carvalho Mendes,Stéphane De Tourdonnet,Ken E.

702,Plant biodiversity enhances bees and other insect pollinators in agroecosystems. A review,2013-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-012-0092-Y,"Thirty-five percent of global production from crops including at least 800 cultivated plants depend on animal pollination. The transformation of agriculture in the past half-century has triggered a decline in bees and other insect pollinators. In North America, losses of bee colonies have accelerated since 2004, leaving the continent with fewer managed pollinators than at any time in the past 50 years. A number of factors linked to industrial modes of agriculture affect bee colonies and other pollinators around the world, ranging from habitat degradation due to monocultures with consequent declines in flowering plants and the use of damaging insecticides. Incentives should be offered to farmers to restore pollinator-friendly habitats, including flower provisioning within or around crop fields and elimination of use of insecticides by adopting agroecological production methods. Conventional farmers should be extremely cautious in the choice, timing, and application of insecticides and other chemicals. Here, we review the literature providing mounting evidence that the restoration of plant biodiversity within and around crop fields can improve habitat for domestic and wild bees as well as other insects and thus enhance pollination services in agroecosystems. Main findings are the following: (1) certain weed species within crop fields that provide food resources and refuge should be maintained at tolerable levels within crop fields to aid in the survival of viable populations of pollinators. (2) Careful manipulation strategies need to be defined in order to avoid weed competition with crops and interference with certain cultural practices. Economic thresholds of weed populations, as well as factors affecting crop–weed balance within a crop season, need to be defined for specific cropping systems. (3) More research is warranted to advance knowledge on identifying beneficial weed species and ways to sponsor them to attract pollinators while not reducing yields through interference. (4) In areas of intensive farming, field margins, field edges and paths, headlands, fence-lines, rights of way, and nearby uncultivated patches of land are important refuges for many pollinators. (5) Maintenance and restoration of hedgerows and other vegetation features at field borders is therefore essential for harboring pollinators. (6) Appropriate management of non-cropped areas to encourage wild pollinators may prove to be a cost-effective means of maximizing crop yield.","Weed,Pollinator,Pollination,Intensive farming,Habitat destruction,Ecology,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination management,World population,Total economic value,Pollinator decline,Sustainability,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Pollinator decline,Pollination,Peponapis pruinosa,restrict,Wildlife,Pollination,Stock (geology),Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination,Landscape ecology,Habitat,Pollination,Ecology,Biology,Population,Pollen,Pest control,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination ecology","Clara I.

A review,2014-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-013-0195-0,"Climate change is rapidly degrading the conditions of crop production. For instance, increasing salinization and aridity is forecasted to increase in most parts of the world. As a consequence, new stress-tolerant species and genotypes must be identified and used for future agriculture. Stress-tolerant species exist but are actually underutilized and neglected. Many stress-tolerant species are indeed traditional crops that are only cultivated by farmers at a local scale. Those species have a high biodiversity value. Besides, the human population will probably reach nine billion within coming decades. To keep pace with population growth, food production must increase dramatically despite the limited availability of cultivable land and water. Here, we review the benefits of quinoa, Chenopodium quinoa Willd., a seed crop that has endured the harsh bioclimatic conditions of the Andes since ancient times. Although the crop is still mainly produced in Bolivia and Peru, agronomic trials and cultivation are spreading to many other countries. Quinoa maintains productivity on rather poor soils and under conditions of water shortage and high salinity. Moreover, quinoa seeds are an exceptionally nutritious food source, owing to their high protein content with all essential amino acids, lack of gluten, and high content of several minerals, e.g., Ca, Mg, Fe, and health-promoting compounds such as flavonoids. Quinoa has a vast genetic diversity resulting from its fragmented and localized production over the centuries in the Andean region, from Ecuador to southern Chile, and from sea level to the altiplano. Quinoa can be adapted to diverse agroecological conditions worldwide. Year 2013 has therefore been declared the International Year of Quinoa by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Here, we review the main characteristics of quinoa, its origin and genetic diversity, its exceptional tolerance to drought and salinity, its nutritional properties, the reasons why this crop can offer several ecosystem services, and the role of Andean farmers in preserving its agrobiodiversity. Finally, we propose a schematic model integrating the fundamental factors that should determine the future utilization of quinoa, in terms of food security, biodiversity conservation, and cultural identity.","Population,Food security,Ecosystem services,Chenopodium quinoa,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural biodiversity,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Sustainable development,Poverty,Food security,Sequence assembly,Population genetics,Germplasm,Triterpene,Saponin,Sapogenin,Pseudocereal,Plant foods,Human nutrition,Starch,Pseudocereal,Protein quality,Salinity,Pseudocereal,Protein quality,Phenols,Phenolic acid,Food science,Pseudocereal,Linoleic acid,Food science,Wheat flour,Wheat bread,South eastern","Karina B.

704,A quantitative and qualitative historical analysis of the scientific discipline of agroecology,2009-01-01,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,10.3763/IJAS.2009.0400,"At present, agroecology can be interpreted as a scientific discipline, as a movement or as a practice. In this paper we analyse the historical evolution of the scientific discipline of agroecology with a quantitative bibliometric analysis of 711 publications using the term agroecology and the derived term agroecological, as well as a qualitative analysis of definitions, topics and scales, where we also include further important works on agroecology. Agroecology emerged in the 1930s and the period up until the 1960s was the initial phase of agroecology. During the 1970s and 1980s, agroecology as a science expanded, and in the 1990s became institutionalized and consolidated. Since the 2000s, broader definitions have provided the basis for new dimensions in agroecology. During the last two decades the range of topics treated within agroecology grew enormously; also the publication rate has exploded within the last 10 years. The scale and dimension of scientific research in agroecology has changed over the past 80 years from the plot or field scale to the farm or agroecosystem scale and finally to the food system. Currently, three approaches persist: (1) the plot/field scale; (2) the agroecosystem/farm scale; and (3) the food system approach. In spite of a vague utilization of the term agroecology through its different meanings and definitions, the new views and dimensions brought to agroecology as a scientific discipline will probably facilitate efforts to respond to actual important questions on sustainable agriculture, global land use and climate change, or food security, due to increasingly applied systems thinking and interdisciplinary research approaches.","Systems thinking,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social science,Scientific method,Food systems,Food security,Environmental resource management,Economics,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Agricultural economics,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Natural capital,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Sustainable development,Resource management,Natural resource management,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Food systems,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization,Valuation (finance),Sociology,Food systems,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Sustainability,Organic farming,Environmental science,Viewpoints,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Sustainability,Rural history,Green Revolution","A.

705,Towards sustainable and multifunctional agriculture in farmland landscapes: Lessons from the integrative approach of a French LTSER platform.,2018-01-01,Science of The Total Environment,10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2018.01.142,"Abstract Agriculture is currently facing unprecedented challenges: ensuring food, fiber and energy production in the face of global change, maintaining the economic performance of farmers and preserving natural resources such as biodiversity and associated key ecosystem services for sustainable agriculture. Addressing these challenges requires innovative landscape scale farming systems that account for changing economic and environmental targets. These novel agricultural systems need to be recognized, accepted and promoted by all stakeholders, including local residents, and supported by public policies. Agroecosystems should be considered as socio-ecological systems and alternative farming systems should be based on ecological principles while taking societal needs into account. This requires an in-depth knowledge of the multiple interactions between sociological and ecological dynamics. Long Term Socio-Ecological Research platforms (LTSER) are ideal for acquiring this knowledge as they (i) are not constrained by traditional disciplinary boundaries, (ii) operate at a large spatial scale involving all stakeholders, and (iii) use systemic approaches to investigate biodiversity and ecosystem services. This study presents the socio-ecological research strategy from the LTSER “Zone Atelier Plaine & Val de Sevre” (ZA PVS), a large study area where data has been sampled since 1994. Its global aim is to identify effective solutions for agricultural development and the conservation of biodiversity in farmlands. Three main objectives are targeted by the ZAPVS. The first objective is intensive monitoring of landscape features, the main taxa present and agricultural practices. The second objective is the experimental investigation, in real fields with local farmers, of important ecosystem functions and services, in relation to pesticide use, crop production and farming socio-economic value. The third aim is to involve stakeholders through participatory research, citizen science and the dissemination of scientific results. This paper underlines the relevance of LTSERs for addressing agricultural challenges, while acknowledging that there are some yet unsolved key challenges.","Sustainable agriculture,Sociology,Socio-ecological system,Participatory action research,Natural resource,Environmental planning,Environmental engineering,Ecosystem services,Citizen science,Agroecology,Agriculture,Reuse,Reusability,Implementation,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Water resources,Sustainability,Socio-hydrology,Socio-ecological system,Social network,Social learning,Population,Nitrogen cycle,Global change,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination management,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Wireless sensor network,Wireless,Traceability,Social network,Social capital,Learning environment","Vincent Bretagnolle,Elsa Berthet,Nicolas Gross,Bertrand Gauffre,Christine Plumejeaud,Sylvie Houte,Isabelle Badenhausser,Karine Monceau,Fabrice Allier,Pascal Monestiez,Sabrina Gaba,Mark D.

Uncontrolled process of enrichment of protective forest plantations woody plants in forest-poor regions leads to invasion. The goal is the development of regulations for the selection of woody plants to safely enhance the biodiversity of protective forest plantations in the steppe and semi-desert. It was revealed that the cluster dendrological sites of the Federal Scientific Centre of Agroecology, Complex Melioration and Protective Afforestation of Russian Academy of Sciences (FSC of Agroecology RAS) serve as a testing ground with a controlled territory for safe testing of plants. The object of research was 600 taxa, of different geographical origin and age. For defensive forest plantations of degraded ecosystems (Volgograd, Samara Oblast) 168 species of trees and shrubs are recommended. The results of studies of generic complexes are the basis for the scheme for analyzing the prospects of woody plants and for selecting an economically important range. In dry steppe conditions, economically important groups from families Rosaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Oleaceae, Fabaceae are recommended for increasing biodiversity. The regulation includes the creation of a stock of planting stock. It is based on ecological compatibility, economic suitability, innovative assortment. Monitoring of experimental populations forming a self-seeding was carried out. In arid conditions, safe methods of reproduction of woody plants have been identified. An algorithm for quantitative and qualitative improvement of the assortment of woody plants has been developed to select the best possible option and the criteria for regulating the sustainable use of the biodiversity of woody plants. They include introduction, selection, seed production and tested at the sites of the study area.","Woody plant,Vegetation,Sustainability,Steppe,Oleaceae,Geography,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Afforestation,Steppe,Robinia,Japonica,Soil water,Russian federation,Plant development,Nut,Geography,Ecology,Urban ecosystem,Liana,Landscaping,Woody plant,Vegetation,Oleaceae,Urban planning,Tree stand,Transport network","Alexandra Semenyutina,Alexandrа Viktorovna Semenyutina,Alexey Dmitrievich Klimov,Alia Sh.

707,High nitrous oxide fluxes from rice indicate the need to manage water for both long- and short-term climate impacts,2018-01-01,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/PNAS.1809276115,"Global rice cultivation is estimated to account for 2.5% of current anthropogenic warming because of emissions of methane (CH 4 ), a short-lived greenhouse gas. This estimate assumes a widespread prevalence of continuous flooding of most rice fields and hence does not include emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), a long-lived greenhouse gas. Based on the belief that minimizing CH 4 from rice cultivation is always climate beneficial, current mitigation policies promote increased use of intermittent flooding. However, results from five intermittently flooded rice farms across three agroecological regions in India indicate that N 2 O emissions per hectare can be three times higher (33 kg-N 2 O⋅ha −1 ⋅season −1 ) than the maximum previously reported. Correlations between N 2 O emissions and management parameters suggest that N 2 O emissions from rice across the Indian subcontinent might be 30–45 times higher under intensified use of intermittent flooding than under continuous flooding. Our data further indicate that comanagement of water with inorganic nitrogen and/or organic matter inputs can decrease climate impacts caused by greenhouse gas emissions up to 90% and nitrogen management might not be central to N 2 O reduction. An understanding of climate benefits/drawbacks over time of different flooding regimes because of differences in N 2 O and CH 4 emissions can help select the most climate-friendly water management regimes for a given area. Region-specific studies of rice farming practices that map flooding regimes and measure effects of multiple comanaged variables on N 2 O and CH 4 emissions are necessary to determine and minimize the climate impacts of rice cultivation over both the short term and long term.","Paddy field,Organic matter,Nitrous oxide,Methane,Hectare,Greenhouse gas,Flooding (psychology),Environmental science,Environmental engineering,Agroecology,Yield gap,Sustainability,Population growth,Sustainability,Political economy of climate change,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Radiative forcing,Poison control,Natural gas,Wetland methane emissions,Methane,Greenhouse gas,Waterlogging (agriculture),Straw,Paddy field,Peat,Greenhouse gas,Fertilizer,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Population,Source type,Satellite data,Satellite,Soil water,Soil texture,Soil test,Vegetation,Spectroradiometer,Spatial analysis","Kritee Kritee,Drishya Nair,Daniel Zavala-Araiza,Jeremy Proville,Nathaniel D.

709,Dectin-1 and TLRs Permit Macrophages to Distinguish between Different Aspergillus fumigatus Cellular States,2006-01-01,Journal of Immunology,10.4049/JIMMUNOL.176.6.3717,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a common cause of invasive and allergic pulmonary disease. Resting conidia of the filamentous fungus are constantly inhaled, but cause infection only after initiating hyphal growth. In this study, we have explored whether macrophages can distinguish between resting spores and the maturing, potentially invasive form of the fungus. Although macrophages bind and ingest A. fumigatus resting conidia efficiently, there is little inflammatory response; NF-κβ is not activated, inflammatory cytokines are not induced, and reactive oxygen species are not produced. However, maturing A. fumigatus conidia and germ tubes stimulate NF-κβ, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and production of reactive oxygen by human monocyte-derived macrophages and murine macrophages from multiple anatomical sites. These responses are in part mediated by dectin-1, which binds cell wall β-glucan that is not present on the surface of dormant conidia, but is present after cellular swelling and loss of the hydrophobic proteinaceous cell wall. Dectin-1 binding to germ tubes augments, but is not required for, TLR2-mediated inflammatory cytokine secretion. Dectin-1 recognition of germ tubes also stimulates TNF-α production in the absence of both TLR2 and MyD88 signaling. These data demonstrate one mechanism by which the pulmonary inflammatory response is tailored toward metabolically active cells, thereby avoiding unnecessary tissue damage with frequent inhalation of ubiquitous spores.","TLR2,Secretion,Reactive oxygen species,Proinflammatory cytokine,Microbiology,Immunology,Hyphal growth,Germ tube,Cytokine secretion,Biology,Aspergillus fumigatus,Pathogen,Mycosis,Microbiology,Zymosan,Tumor necrosis factor alpha,Toll-like receptor,Zymosan,Tyrosine,Tumor necrosis factor alpha,Receptor,Pattern recognition receptor,Innate immune system,Yeast,Receptor,Phagocytosis,Serum amyloid P component,Receptor,Pentraxins,Zymosan,Secretion,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Proinflammatory cytokine,Microbiology,Innate immune system,Secretion,Phagosome,Microbiology,Population,Pathology,Pathogenesis","Geoffrey M.

However, there have been limited comprehensive studies of this and other basins with diverse agroecologies. We analyzed the variability of gross soil loss and sediment yield rates under present and expected future conditions using a newly devised methodological framework. The results showed that the basin generates an average soil loss rate of 27.5 t ha − 1  yr − 1 and a gross soil loss of ca. 473 Mt yr − 1 , of which, at least 10% comes from gully erosion and 26.7% leaves Ethiopia. In a factor analysis, variation in agroecology (average factor score = 1.32) and slope (1.28) were the two factors most responsible for this high spatial variability. About 39% of the basin area is experiencing severe to very severe (> 30 t ha − 1  yr − 1 ) soil erosion risk, which is strongly linked to population density. Severe or very severe soil erosion affects the largest proportion of land in three subbasins of the UBNR basin: Blue Nile 4 (53.9%), Blue Nile 3 (45.1%), and Jema Shet (42.5%). If appropriate soil and water conservation practices targeted ca. 77.3% of the area with moderate to severe erosion (> 15 t ha − 1  yr − 1 ), the total soil loss from the basin could be reduced by ca. 52%. Our methodological framework identified the potential risk for soil erosion in large-scale zones, and with a more sophisticated model and input data of higher spatial and temporal resolution, results could be specified locally within these risk zones. Accurate assessment of soil erosion in the UBNR basin would support sustainable use of the basin's land resources and possibly open up prospects for cooperation in the Eastern Nile region.","Structural basin,Spatial variability,Soil conservation,SWAT model,Rock fragment,Hydrology,Erosion,Drainage basin,Chemistry,Agroecology,WEPP,Universal Soil Loss Equation,Surface runoff,Surface runoff,Soil science,Soil retrogression and degradation,Universal Soil Loss Equation,Soil water,No-till farming,Water quality,Sediment transport,Sediment,WEPP,Vegetation,Soil retrogression and degradation,WEPP,Surface runoff,Structural basin,Surface runoff,Soil conservation,Rift valley,Time series,Surface runoff,Precipitation,Watershed,Truncation,Soil water,Universal Soil Loss Equation,Surface runoff,Spatial variability","Nigussie Haregeweyn,Atsushi Tsunekawa,Jean Poesen,Mitsuru Tsubo,Derege Tsegaye Meshesha,Ayele Almaw Fenta,Jan Nyssen,Enyew Adgo,K.

711,"Permaculture for agroecology: design, movement, practice, and worldview. A review",2014-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-013-0181-6,"Agroecology is a promising alternative to industrial agriculture, with the potential to avoid the negative social and ecological consequences of input-intensive production. Transitioning to agroecological production is, however, a complex project that requires diverse contributions from the outside of scientific institutions. Agroecologists therefore collaborate with traditional producers and agroecological movements. Permaculture is one such agroecological movement, with a broad international distribution and a unique approach to system design. Despite a high public profile, permaculture has remained relatively isolated from scientific research. Though the potential contribution of permaculture to agroecological transition is great, it is limited by this isolation from science, as well as from oversimplifying claims, and the lack of a clear definition. Here, we review scientific and popular permaculture literature. A systematic review discusses quantitative bibliometric data, including keyword analysis. A qualitative review identifies and assesses major themes, proposals, and claims. The manuscript follows a stratified definition of permaculture as design system, best practice framework, worldview, and movement. The major points of our analysis are as follows: (1) Principles and topics largely complement and even extend principles and topics found in the agroecological literature. (2) Distinctive approaches to perennial polyculture, water management, and the importance of agroecosystem configuration exceed what is documented in the scientific literature and thus suggest promising avenues of inquiry. (3) Discussions of practice consistently underplay the complexity, challenges, and risks that producers face in developing diversified and integrated production systems. (4) The movement is mobilizing diverse forms of social support for sustainability, in geographically diverse locations. (5) And scholarship in permaculture has always been a diverse marginal sector, but is growing.","Sustainable development,Sustainability,Scientific method,Scientific literature,Permaculture,Biology,Best practice,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agroecological restoration,Software engineering,Modularity (networks),Modularity,World Wide Web,Visualization,User-centered design,Random walk closeness centrality,Network controllability,Network analysis,Standard of living,Social policy,Poverty,Tropical deforestation,Proximate,Population,Traditional knowledge GIS,Traditional knowledge,Resource management,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant,Sustainability,Soil quality,Poverty,Rural population,Public policy,Private sector,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture","Rafter Sass Ferguson,Sarah Taylor Lovell,Mark Newman,Mathieu Bastian,Sebastien Heymann,Mathieu Jacomy,Ulrik Brandes,Khalid Malik,Helmut Josef Geist,E.

However, it remains unclear whether these findings reflect a global crisis for crop pollination. Understanding the extent to which world agriculture is endangered by pollinator decline is essential if the economic valuation of nature is to be used to promote conservation. 2. We assess the susceptibility to pollinator limitation of one of the most important tropical and subtropical fruit crops, mango Mangifera indica L., commonly planted in a region of South Africa located between two large biodiversity-rich protected natural areas. We conducted flower visitor surveys, exclusion experiments and spatial analysis of flower visitation and fruit production patterns. 3. Our results show that both ants and flower visitors were effective pollinators of mango, the latter significantly declining (in abundance and species richness) with distance to natural habitat while ants were not affected. Neither the absence of pesticides nor the supplementation of flower visitors by using managed honeybees served to offset these negative impacts. Food-web data suggest that maintaining diversity of flower resources within farmland can help maintain pollinator communities. 4. Moreover, models based exclusively on pollinator abundance underestimated the negative effect of distance from natural habitat on production (42% less at 500 m from natural habitat). As soil nutrient levels and water content are regularly measured and corrected in all study sites, these results suggest that pollinator diversity may also be important. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study provides one of the first examples of marked pollination limitation in farms surrounded by well-protected natural habitat. For mango farming to be sustainable, it is essential to limit contiguous growth of farmland and consider practices that restore the complexity of plant-pollinator networks within farms, for example through the creation and maintenance of pollinator-friendly areas. By highlighting the economic gains of adopting pollinator-friendly practices in agriculture, this work contributes to a growing body of studies that reveal that making farmland more suitable for pollinators benefits both agriculture and nature conservation.","Species richness,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination,Habitat,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Statistical theory,Statistical inference,Model selection,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination management,Pollinator decline,Pollination,Peponapis pruinosa,Species richness,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination,Natural resource management,Landscape ecology,Population,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Stock (geology),Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Species richness,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Sustainability,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Rainforest,Pollinator decline,Pollinator","Luísa G.

As a policy framework the knowledge-based bio-economy has attracted two contending visions, which can be analyzed as imaginaries – strategic discourses prefiguring a possible, desirable future. In the dominant vision, life sciences will enhance productivity for European competitive advantage in global value chains. A rival vision links agroecology and shorter food supply chains, as a means for farmers to gain more from the value that they add. Each vision favors a different diagnosis of unsustainable agriculture and eco-efficient remedies. Each extends a different paradigm of agri-innovation, foreseeing an economic community that can gain from future markets. These two contending visions give different meanings to the same key terms – knowledge, biological resources and economy. In the EU’s research program for a knowledge-based bio-economy, a life sciences vision dominates the priorities, though agroecology has also gained a significant place in response to proposals from stakeholder networks.

At the Kellogg Biological Station Long Term Ecological Research site in agroecology, we contrasted A. glycines establishment and population growth under three agricultural production systems that differed markedly in disturbance and fertility regimes. Agricultural treatments consisted of a conventional-tillage high-input system, a no-tillage high-input system, and a zero-chemical- input system under conventional tillage. By selectively restricting or allowing predator access we simultaneously determined aphid response to top-down and bottom-up influences. Irrespective of predator exclusion, our agricultural manipulations did not result in bottom-up control of A. glycines intrinsic rate of increase or realized population growth. In contrast, we observed strong evidence for top-down control of A. glycines establishment and overall population growth in all production systems. Abundant predators, including Harmonia axyridis, Coccinella septempunctata, Orius insidiosus, and various predaceous fly larvae, significantly reduced A. glycines establishment and population increase in all trials. In contrast to other systems in which bottom-up forces control herbivore populations, we conclude that A. glycines is primarily controlled via top-down influences of generalist predators under a wide range of agricultural management systems. Understanding the role of top-down and bottom- up forces in this context allows agricultural managers to focus on effective strategies for control of this invasive pest.","Soybean aphid,Predation,Population dynamics,Orius insidiosus,Herbivore,Ecology,Coccinella septempunctata,Biology,Aphid,Agronomy,Agroecology,Statistics,Principal component analysis,Path analysis (statistics),Soil carbon,Radiative forcing,Methane,Zoology,Predator,Predation,Trophic cascade,Taxon,Species diversity,Top-down and bottom-up design,Terrestrial ecosystem,Ecology,Ungulate,Species diversity,Predator,Predation,Harmonia axyridis,Guild,Top-down and bottom-up design,Primary productivity,Ecology,Soybean aphid,PEST analysis,Homoptera,Predator,Predation,Hippodamia convergens","Alejandro C.

716,Integrating agroecology and landscape multifunctionality in Vermont: An evolving framework to evaluate the design of agroecosystems,2010-01-01,Agricultural Systems,10.1016/J.AGSY.2010.03.003,"Agroecosystems cover vast areas of land worldwide and are known to have a large impact on the environment, yet these highly modified landscapes are rarely considered as candidates for landscape design. While intentionally-designed agricultural landscapes could serve many different functions, few resources exist for evaluating the design of these complex landscapes, particularly at the scale of the whole-farm. The objective of this paper is to introduce an evolving framework for evaluating the design of agroecosystems based on a critical review of the literature on landscape multifunctionality and agroecology. We consider how agroecosystems might be designed to incorporate additional functions while adhering to agroecology principles for managing the landscape. The framework includes an assessment tool for evaluating farm design based on the extent of fine-scale land use features and their specific functions, to consider the present state of the farm, to plan for future conditions, or to compare alternative futures for the design of the farm. We apply this framework to two farms in Vermont that are recognized locally as successful, multifunctional landscapes. The Intervale Center, an agricultural landscape located within the city limits, serves as an incubator for new farm startups and provides unique cultural functions that benefit the local community. Butterworks Farm, a private operation producing organic yogurt and other food products, achieves important ecological functions through an integrated crop-livestock system. These farms and many others in Vermont serve as models of a framework that integrates landscape multifunctionality and agroecology in the design of the landscape. In the discussion section, we draw from the literature and our work to propose a set of important themes that might be considered for future research.","Organic farming,Local community,Landscape design,Land use,Food systems,Ecosystem services,Economics,Ecological design,Agronomy,Agroecology,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Valuation (finance),Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Rural sociology,Rural area,Transformation processes,Sustainability science,Sustainability,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Food systems,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Measurement of biodiversity,Land use,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization","Sarah Taylor Lovell,S’ra DeSantis,Chloe A.

718,Is There a Need for a More Sustainable Agriculture,2011-01-01,Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences,10.1080/07352689.2011.553515,"In this paper the environmental impact of current agriculture practices is reviewed. Soil loss (along with soil fertility), increasing water demand from agricultural practices and environmental pollution caused by the intensive use of agrochemicals, are among the most pressing issues concerning agriculture sustainability. Biodiversity loss due to land use change and emission of greenhouse gasses from agricultural activities are also causes for concern. A number of alternative agricultural practices are also presented that can help to make agriculture less environmentally damaging by reducing the use of natural resources, limiting inputs and preserving soil fertility and biodiversity.

719,Why are grain-legumes rarely present in cropping systems despite their environmental and nutritional benefits? Analyzing lock-in in the French agrifood system,2016-01-01,Ecological Economics,10.1016/J.ECOLECON.2016.03.024,"Grain-legume plants fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil and thus do not need nitrogen fertilizers. Therefore, grain-legumes can potentially decrease global warming, as nitrogen fertilization is responsible for half of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, grain-legumes have many functional and nutritional properties both as feed and food. Despite the fact that the European Union has granted considerable subsidies to promote grain-legume cultivation, their production continues to fall and there has been no satisfactory explanation as to why. This study provides an answer by showing that a situation of technological lock-in has resulted from the co-evolution of crop systems, based on an agrochemical paradigm, public policies, and market dynamics that promote cereals. This process began with the historical choice by European and French public institutions to relegate grain-legumes to feed in direct competition with imported soybeans. Moreover, interrelated factors, such as breeding selection, public subsidies, and food systems, have favored increasing returns to adoption for cereals to the detriment of grain-legumes. Finally, the evolutionary economics approach used here identified several actions that must be implemented together, such as agricultural cost-accounting methods, nitrogen management, institutional innovations, and market outlets to promote grain-legumes and move towards more sustainable agriculture.","Sustainable agriculture,Subsidy,Returns to scale,Food systems,European union,Economics,Agroecology,Agrochemical,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Technological transitions,Supply and demand,Subsidy,Path dependency,Path dependence,Path creation,Returns to scale,Path dependence,Path creation,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Sociology,Typology,Resource management,Natural resource management,European union,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Total human ecosystem,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Environmental resource management,Transdisciplinarity,Terminology,Sustainability science,Surgery,Saturated fatty acid,Saturated fat,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Food systems","Marie-Benoit Magrini,Marc Anton,Célia Cholez,Guenaelle Corre-Hellou,Gérard Duc,Marie-Hélène Jeuffroy,Jean-Marc Meynard,Elise Pelzer,Anne-Sophie Voisin,Stéphane Walrand,W.

Here we use a food-web approach to analyse the community structure and function at the whole-farm scale. Quantitative food webs from 10 replicate pairs of organic and conventional farms showed that organic farms have significantly more species at three trophic levels (plant, herbivore and parasitoid) and significantly different network structure. Herbivores on organic farms were attacked by more parasitoid species on organic farms than on conventional farms. However, differences in network structure did not translate into differences in robustness to simulated species loss and we found no difference in percentage parasitism (natural pest control) across a variety of host species. Furthermore, a manipulative field experiment demonstrated that the higher species richness of parasitoids on the organic farms did not increase mortality of a novel herbivore used to bioassay ecosystem service. The explanation for these differences is likely to include inherent differences in management strategies and landscape structure between the two farming systems.","Species richness,Organic farming,Integrated pest management,Food web,Food chain,Ecosystem services,Ecosystem,Ecology,Biology,Agroecology,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination management,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Total human ecosystem,Species diversity,Geography,Sustainability,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Need to know,Natural resource management,Environmental resource management,Species richness,Population density,Organic farming,Pollinator decline,Pollination,Peponapis pruinosa,restrict,Wildlife,Pollination,Land use,Intensive farming,Integrated farming","Sarina Macfadyen,Rachel Gibson,Andrew Polaszek,Rebecca J.

However, such valuations make untested assumptions about the ecological effect of bats in agroecosystems. Specifically, estimates of the value of pest suppression services assume bats consume sufficient numbers of crop pests to affect impact pest reproduction and subsequent damage to crops. Corn is an essential crop for farmers, and is grown on more than 150 million hectares worldwide. Using large exclosures in corn fields, we show that bats exert sufficient pressure on crop pests to suppress larval densities and damage in this cosmopolitan crop. In addition, we show that bats suppress pest-associated fungal growth and mycotoxin in corn. We estimate the suppression of herbivory by insectivorous bats is worth more than 1 billion USD globally on this crop alone, and bats may further benefit farmers by indirectly suppressing pest-associated fungal growth and toxic compounds on corn. Bats face a variety of threats globally, but their relevance as predators of insects in ubiquitous corn-dominated landscapes underlines the economic and ecological importance of conserving biodiversity.","Trophic cascade,Predation,Insectivore,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Crop,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroecology,Agriculture,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Wildlife management,Wildlife conservation,Pseudogymnoascus destructans,Valuation (finance),Sustainable agriculture,Nonmarket forces,White-nose syndrome,Predation,Insectivore,Wind power,Tax credit,Subsidy,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Biology,Trophic cascade,Taxon,Species diversity,Predation,Pest control,PEST analysis,Tadarida brasiliensis,Predation,Pest control","Josiah J.

Yet, in spite of our knowledge of their value, conservation buffers have not been fully embraced by landowners, or even by policy makers in the United States (US). In this critical review, we examine why conservation buffers remain underutilized in US agroecosystems. We examine the literature on the environmental benefits of buffers, the economic issues related to buffer adoption, and the importance of the aesthetic quality and design of buffers. We propose that many questions related to buffer design and management remain unanswered, and suggest a variety of areas in which future research is necessary to improve buffer functionality and adoption. The implications of this synthesis for designers, planners, scientists, policy makers, and citizens are discussed. Recommendations include: modifying policies to better reflect the preferences of landowners and society, studying buffer systems at the watershed scale using multidisciplinary approaches, and designing buffers that consider aesthetic preferences and regional variation. # 2005 Elsevier B.V.

725,Multiple cropping systems as drivers for providing multiple ecosystem services: from concepts to design,2015-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-014-0272-Z,"Provisioning services, such as the production of food, feed, and fiber, have always been the main focus of agriculture. Since the 1950s, intensive cropping systems based on the cultivation of a single crop or a single cultivar, in simplified rotations or monocultures, and relying on extensive use of agrochemical inputs have been preferred to more diverse, self-sustaining cropping systems, regardless of the environmental consequences. However, there is increasing evidence that such intensive agroecosystems have led to a decline in biodiversity as well as threatening the environment and have damaged a number of ecosystem services such as the biogeochemical nutrient cycles and the regulation of climate and water quality. Consequently, the current challenge facing agriculture is to ensure the future of food production while reducing the use of inputs and limiting environmental impacts and the loss of biodiversity. Here, we review examples of multiple cropping systems that aim to use biotic interactions to reduce chemical inputs and provide more ecosystem services than just provisioning. Our main findings are the identification of underlying ecological processes and management strategies related to the provision of pairs of ecosystem services namely food production and a regulation service. We also found gaps between ecological knowledge and the constraints of agricultural practices in taking account of the interactions and possible trade-offs between multiple ecosystem services as well as socioeconomic constraints. We present guidelines for the design of multiple cropping systems combining ecological, agricultural, and genetic concepts and approaches.","Sustainable development,Provisioning,Multiple cropping,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Cropping,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agrochemical,Agriculture,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Species richness,Natural resource economics,Humanity,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Unified neutral theory of biodiversity,Storage effect,Species diversity,Total human ecosystem,Measurement of biodiversity,Environmental resource management,Sustainable agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Total human ecosystem,Systems ecology,Sustainability,Tillage,Soil water,Soil science","Sabrina Gaba,Françoise Lescourret,Simon Boudsocq,Jérôme Enjalbert,Millenium Ecosystem Assessment,Bradley J.

Confronting the Coffee Crisis explores small-scale farming, the political economy of the global coffee industry, and initiatives that claim to promote more sustainable rural development in coffee-producing communities. Contributors review the historical, political, economic, and agroecological processes within today's coffee industry and analyze the severely depressed export market that faces small-scale growers in Mexico and Central America. The book presents a series of interdisciplinary, empirically rich case studies showing how small-scale farmers manage ecosystems and organize collectively as they seek useful collaborations with international NGOs and coffee companies to create opportunities for themselves in the coffee market. The findings demonstrate the interconnections among farmer livelihoods, biodiversity, conservation, and changing coffee markets. Additional chapters examine alternative trade practices, certification, and eco-labeling, discussing the politics and market growth of organic, shade-grown, and Fair Trade coffees.

The first, efficiency-substitution agriculture, aims to improve input use efficiency and to minimise environmental impacts of modern farming systems. It is currently the dominant modernisation pathway. The second, biodiversity-based agriculture, aims to develop ecosystem services provided by biological diversity. It currently exists only as a niche. Here we review challenges of implementing biodiversity-based agriculture: managing, at the local level, a consistent transition within and among farming systems, supply chains and natural resource management. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing conceptual frameworks developed to analyse farming, social-ecological and socio-technical systems. Then we present an integrative framework tailored for structuring analysis of agriculture from the perspective of developing a territorial biodiversity-based agriculture. In addition, we propose a participatory methodology to design this agroecological transition at the local level. This design methodology was developed to support a multi-stakeholder arena in analysing the current situation, identifying future exogenous changes and designing (1) targeted territorial biodiversity-based agriculture, (2) the pathway of the transition and (3) the required adaptive governance structures and management strategies. We conclude by analysing key challenges of designing such a complex transition, developing multi-actor and multi-domain approaches based on a combination of scientific and experiential knowledge and on building suitable boundary objects (computer-based and conceptual models, indicators, etc.) to assess innovative systems designed by stakeholders.","Sustainable development,Natural resource management,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Conceptual framework,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agroecological restoration,Agriculture,Adaptive management,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Transaction cost,Rational choice institutionalism,Path dependence,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Water resources,Sustainability,Socio-hydrology,Species richness,Natural resource economics,Humanity,Syntax,Sociology,Norm (social),Socio-ecological system,Social network,Social learning,Reactive nitrogen,Nitrogen cycle,Industrial production,Typology,Technological transitions,System innovation","Michel Duru,Olivier Therond,M’hand Fares,H.

It is routinely depicted as a generic GM vitamin tablet in a generic plant bound for the global South. But the release of Golden Rice is on the horizon only in the Philippines, a country with a storied history and complicated present, and contested future for rice production and consumption. The present paper corrects this blinkered view of Golden Rice through an analysis of three distinctive “rice worlds” of the Philippines: Green Revolution rice developed at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the 1960s, Golden Rice currently being bred at IRRI, and a scheme to promote and export traditional “heirloom” landrace rice. More than mere seed types, these rices are at the centers of separate “rice worlds” with distinctive concepts of what the crop should be and how it should be produced. In contrast to the common productivist framework for comparing types of rice, this paper compares the rice worlds on the basis of geographical embeddedness, or the extent to which local agroecological context is valorized or nullified in the crop’s construction. The Green Revolution spread generic, disembedded high-input seeds to replace locally adapted landraces as well as peasant attitudes and practices associated with them. The disembeddedness of Golden Rice that boosts its value as a public relations vehicle has also been the main impediment in it reaching farmers’ fields, as it has proved difficult to breed into varieties that grow well specifically in the Philippines. Finally, and somewhat ironically, IRRI has recently undertaken research and promotion of heirloom seeds in collaboration with the export scheme.","Socioeconomics,Peasant,Heirloom plant,Green Revolution,Golden rice,Genetically modified crops,Embeddedness,Economics,Crop,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agricultural economics,Social structure,Social relation,Social network,beta-Carotene,Provitamin,Oryza sativa,Yield gap,Irrigation,Growing season,Livelihood,Green Revolution,Food security,Pest control,Integrated pest management,Genetically modified organism,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Rhetoric,Social movement,Ramification,Organic production,Sustainable agriculture,Short food supply chains,Scrutiny,Photosynthetic efficiency,Photosynthesis,Natural resource economics,Rice crop,Panicle,Japonica","Glenn Davis Stone,Dominic Glover,Mark Granovetter,Xudong Ye,Salim Al-Babili,Andreas Klöti,Jing Zhang,Paola Lucca,David B.

We sought to estimate the effect of Connecticut’s implementation of a handgun permit-to-purchase law in October 1995 on subsequent homicides.Methods. Using the synthetic control method, we compared Connecticut’s homicide rates after the law’s implementation to rates we would have expected had the law not been implemented. To estimate the counterfactual, we used longitudinal data from a weighted combination of comparison states identified based on the ability of their prelaw homicide trends and covariates to predict prelaw homicide trends in Connecticut.Results. We estimated that the law was associated with a 40% reduction in Connecticut’s firearm homicide rates during the first 10 years that the law was in place.

730,Addressing the dynamics of agri-food systems: an emerging agenda for social science research,2009-01-01,Environmental Science & Policy,10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2009.03.001,"The ‘modernist’ project that has come to dominate food and agricultural policy has failed to provide sustainable outcomes for many poor people in developing countries. Conventional agricultural science is not able to explain let alone address these concerns because it is based on a static equilibrium-centred view that provides little insight into the dynamic character of agri-food systems. This paper analyses how prevailing narratives of technological change and economic growth have come to dominate key food and agriculture policy debates. It seeks to counter these orthodox notions by emphasising that agri-food systems are embedded in complex ecological, economic and social processes, and showing how their interactions are dynamic and vulnerable to short-term shocks and long-term stresses like climate change. The paper makes the case for a deeper understanding of diverse ‘rural worlds’ and their potential pathways to sustainability through agriculture. Moreover, it argues for a normative focus on poverty reduction and concern for the distributional consequences of dynamic changes in agri-food systems, rather than aggregates and averages.

731,Conserved markers of fetal pancreatic epithelium permit prospective isolation of islet progenitor cells by FACS,2007-01-01,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/PNAS.0609490104,"Prospective isolation and characterization of progenitor cells is a paradigmatic strategy for studies of organ development. However, extraction of viable cells, fractionation of lineages, and in vitro analysis of progenitors from the fetal pancreas in experimental organisms like mice has proved challenging and has not yet been reported for human fetal pancreas. Here, we report isolation of pancreatic islet progenitor cells from fetal mice by FACS. Monoclonal antibodies that recognize cell-surface proteins on candidate stem cells in brain, skin, and other organs enabled separation of major pancreatic cell lineages and isolation of native pancreatic cells expressing neurogenin 3, an established marker of islet progenitors. New in vitro cell culture methods permitted isolated mouse islet progenitors to develop into hormone-expressing endocrine cells. Insulin-producing cells derived in vitro required or expressed factors that regulate fetal β cell differentiation; thus, the genetic programs normally controlling in vivo mouse islet development are similarly required in our system. Moreover, antibodies that recognize conserved orthologous cell-surface epitopes in human fetal pancreas allowed FACS-based enrichment of candidate islet progenitor cells expressing neurogenin 3. Our studies reveal previously undescribed strategies for prospective purification and analysis of pancreatic endocrine progenitor cells that should accelerate studies of islet development and replacement.","Stem cell,Progenitor cell,Pancreas,Monoclonal antibody,Molecular biology,Islet,Epitope,Enteroendocrine cell,Cellular differentiation,Cell biology,Biology,Stem cell,Progenitor cell,Population,Stem cell transplantation for articular cartilage repair,Stem cell theory of aging,Stem cell,Tyrosine hydroxylase,Stromal cell,Neuroscience,Stem cell,Pancreatic progenitor cell,Pancreatic duct,Stem cell,Radial glial cell,Neurosphere,Staining,Molecular biology,Insulin,RFX6,Pancreatic progenitor cell,Pancreas morphogenesis,Stem cell,Molecular biology,Interleukin 3,Progenitor cell,Pancreatic progenitor cell,Pancreas morphogenesis,Transgene,Phenotype,Pancreatic hormone","Takuya Sugiyama,Ryan T.

733,What is this thing called organic? – How organic farming is codified in regulations,2017-01-01,Food Policy,10.1016/J.FOODPOL.2016.12.009,"Organic farming is one of the fastest growing sectors of world agriculture. Although it represents only 1% of world agricultural area, organic is one of the most recognized food labels and most people in developed countries consume some amount of organic food today. There is a wide range of interpretations of what organic means by different actors in the sector. Here we examine eight different organic regulations from across the world to understand how they have codified the large diversity of ideas inherent in organic agriculture. Our analysis shows that organic practices and regulations do not differ substantially between countries – across the board organic regulations define organic mainly in terms of 'natural' vs. 'artificial' substances that are allowed (or not) as inputs. This interpretation of organic as “chemical-free” farming, largely void of broader environmental principles, does not fully incorporate the original ideas of organic theoreticians who conceived it as a holistic farming system aimed primarily at improving soil health, thereby leading to improved animal, human, and societal health. This narrow focus of organic regulations can be explained by the interest of organic consumers who predominantly buy organic because they believe it is healthier and more nutritious due to the absence of harmful substances. Organic regulations need to place more emphasis on environmental best practices in order to ensure that organic agriculture can contribute to sustainability objectives.","Sustainability,Organic farming,Economics,Content analysis,Best practice,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Trustworthiness,Summative assessment,Social psychology,Scarcity,Phosphorus,Phosphorite,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Sustainability,Statistics,Principles of Organic Agriculture,Theoretical computer science,Sampling (statistics),RELIABILITY VALIDITY,Sustainability,Perception,Marketing,Publication bias,Pesticide residue,Pesticide,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Population,Paddy field,Oryza sativa,Monoculture,Survey result,Purchasing,Product (category theory)","Verena Seufert,Navin Ramankutty,Tabea Mayerhofer,Hsiu Fang Hsieh,Sarah E.

This presents a challenge for climate resilient development strategies, as exposure to climate variability and change, climate impacts, and adaptive capacity differ between communities located within common cultural and administrative units. The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) framed within the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vulnerability framework (LVI-IPCC) offers a tool to assess climate vulnerability through direct household surveys. This makes it particularly appropriate for analyses at sub-community and community scales. Here we apply the LVI-IPCC to communities of Choke Mountain, located in the Blue Nile Highlands of Ethiopia. Recognizing the physiographic and climatic diversity that exists in this mountainous environment, we implement LVI-IPCC analysis for 793 mixed crop-livestock farming households using the five distinct agroecological systems (AES) that compose the populated area of Choke Mountain as a framework for analysis. For each AES, an LVI index, adaptive capacity metric, and LVI-IPCC vulnerability score was calculated. We found that each of these metrics varied systematically across AES. High elevation sloping lands and low elevation steep lands exhibited relatively low adaptive capacity and high vulnerability while midland AES had higher capacity and lower vulnerability. These results suggest that resilience building interventions for Choke Mountain ecosystems should be targeted to address the specific circumstances of each AES. The approach of applying LVI-IPCC at AES scale could be applicable to other climate vulnerable mountainous regions.","Vulnerability index,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Livelihood,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem,Economics,Climate change,Agroecology,Adaptive capacity,Runaway climate change,Physical science,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report,Vulnerability,Sustainability,Latin Americans,Reproductive health,Interior design,Health policy,Public administration,Political science,Group ii,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Top-down and bottom-up design,Vulnerability,Systems analysis,Socioeconomics,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Terminology,Subsistence agriculture,Sharecropping,Incentive,Water security,Water resources,Vulnerability index,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Social vulnerability","Belay Simane,Benjamin F.

735,The spatial aggregation of organic farming in England and its underlying environmental correlates,2009-01-01,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/J.1365-2664.2009.01624.X,"Summary 1 Given the current debate on the global food crisis, conservation in Europe is expected to shift from maximizing biodiversity at the expense of yield to conserving biodiversity under food production constraints. Organic farming is potentially of great importance for environmentally sustainable farming. Understanding the distribution of organic farms and the environmental, social and cultural correlates is necessary to predict the way in which this may change over time. 2 We collated data from 30 variables describing the topography, climate, soils, farm size/type, human population characteristics and farm business in the English agricultural landscape. Factor analysis reduced these variables to six orthogonal axes, which describe the suitability of land for arable farming, the degree of ruralization (distance to urban centres and population density), the farm size and type, the soil hydrology and texture, and the amount of woodland (forestry). 3 An analysis of the distribution of organic farms showed that they are spatially aggregated at the regional and neighbourhood scales and that their presence in a 10 × 10-km grid square can be predicted from the farm size/type. 4 Analysis of the concentration of organic farms showed that about a third of the variance in their occurrence across the country can be predicted by a statistical model including the six landscape axes and a term to account for spatial aggregation. 5 Synthesis and applications. Our results show that a combination of environmental variables associated with a lower agricultural potential predisposes farmers to convert to organic farming, which further promotes conversion of farmers in the neighbourhood. Organic farming as a ‘wildlife friendly’ method is more likely to occur in agriculturally less-favoured areas where economic incentives for conversion to organic farming do not need to be high and the loss of production due to conversion will be comparatively small. This suggests that an efficient conservation strategy, which takes the global demand for food into account, would be to promote organic farming as an agri-environment scheme in landscapes that are already rich in organic farms at the expense of those existing high-production landscapes that are not.","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Population,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Ecology,Ecological farming,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,South asia,Natural resource economics,Malnutrition,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat,Wildlife conservation,Land management,Habitat,Wildlife conservation,Species richness,Landscape-scale conservation,Sustainability,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Species richness,Population density,Organic farming,Waste management,Land use,Food waste,Vegetation,Umbrella species,Measurement of biodiversity,Land use,Intensive farming,Integrated farming","Doreen Gabriel,Stephen J.

737,Agroecological principles for the redesign of integrated crop–livestock systems,2014-01-01,European Journal of Agronomy,10.1016/J.EJA.2013.09.010,"Combining crops and livestock within integrated crop–livestock systems (ICLS) represents an opportunity to improve the sustainability of farming systems. The objective of this paper is to analyse how agroecological principles can help farmers to redesign and improve the resilience, self-sufficiency, productivity, and efficiency of ICLS. Relying on case studies from Brazil and France, we examine how the transformation of two conventional, specialised systems into more integrated-production systems illustrates the different dynamics towards agroecological ICLS. The French case study, based on self-sufficient farming systems belonging to a sustainable agriculture network, highlights that cost-cutting management led to a win–win strategy comprising good economic and environmental performances. The farms decreased their dependence on external inputs and had only a limited loss of production. The past trajectories of the farms illustrate how increasing the interactions between subsystems improved the self-sufficiency and efficiency of the farms. The Brazilian case study compares slash-and-burn agriculture in the Amazonian region with the recovery of degraded grazing area by ICLS. A small increase in chemical inputs linked to a diversification of productions led to a large increase in production and a large decrease in environmental impacts (deforestation). The Brazilian case study also illustrates how the diversification of production increased the resilience of the system to market shocks. Reconstructing the links among soil, crops, and animals following agroecological principles could improve the different performances of ICLS. New agroecological ICLS, benefiting from diversified productions and increased interactions between subsystems, are likely to offset the trade-off between agricultural production and environmental impacts observed in current ICLS.","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Psychological resilience,Diversification (marketing strategy),Deforestation,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Wildlife conservation,Land management,Habitat,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Natural capital,Plant diversity,Niche complementarity,Niche,Sustainability,Manure,Livestock,Treaty,Supply chain,Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation,Stakeholder engagement,Stakeholder analysis,Stakeholder,Vulnerability,Public policy,Logging,Sustainable development,Resource management,Natural resource management,Resource use,Natural resource economics,Livestock,Socio-ecological system,Psychological resilience,Perception","Thierry Bonaudo,Amaury Burlamaqui Bendahan,Rodolphe Sabatier,Julie Ryschawy,Rhys E.

This article uses energy balances to evaluate the contribution of organic olive growing to the increase in the energy efficiency of Mediterranean agriculture, distinguished according to type of watering regime and intensiveness of cultivation. The results show, on one side, the lower energy efficiency of irrigated land as opposed to dryland (i.e. non-irrigated) regardless of their style of management and, on the other, the greater non-renewable energy efficiency of organic olive growing in comparison with the conventional production. Nevertheless, organic management could still improve its energy efficiency if it further adjusts and internalizes the flows of nutrients needed in order to achieve greater sustainability.","Sustainability,Organic farming,Greenhouse gas,Environmental impact of the energy industry,Energy source,Efficient energy use,Economics,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Water quality,Organic farming,Intensive farming,Life-cycle assessment,Environmental science,Environmental planning,Organic farming,Intensive farming,Greenhouse gas,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Rural development,Geography,Economic growth,Sustainability,Organic farming,Environmental science,Water use,Sustainability,Organic farming,Raw material,Life-cycle assessment,Ethanol fuel,Nutrient,Malus,Integrated production,Waste management,Total energy,Renewable energy","Gloria I.

740,Uncertainty in soil data can outweigh climate impact signals in global crop yield simulations,2016-01-01,Nature Communications,10.1038/NCOMMS11872,"Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) are increasingly used for agro-environmental assessments and estimates of climate change impacts on food production. Recently, the influence of climate data and weather variability on GGCM outcomes has come under detailed scrutiny, unlike the influence of soil data. Here we compare yield variability caused by the soil type selected for GGCM simulations to weather-induced yield variability. Without fertilizer application, soil-type-related yield variability generally outweighs the simulated inter-annual variability in yield due to weather. Increasing applications of fertilizer and irrigation reduce this variability until it is practically negligible. Importantly, estimated climate change effects on yield can be either negative or positive depending on the chosen soil type. Soils thus have the capacity to either buffer or amplify these impacts. Our findings call for improvements in soil data available for crop modelling and more explicit accounting for soil variability in GGCM simulations.","Soil water,Soil type,Plant ecology,Irrigation,Genetics,Fertilizer,Crop yield,Climate change,Biology,Bioinformatics,Agroecology,Agricultural engineering,Water cycle,Meteorology,Meteorological reanalysis,Physics,Meteorology,Earth system science,World map,Water resources,Regionalisation,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Soil fertility,Yield gap,Sustainability,Population growth,Tropics,Representative Concentration Pathways,Food security,Reactive nitrogen,Nitrogen,Nitrate,Primary production,Plant cover,Land use,Water transport,Water cycle,Rain gauge","Christian Folberth,Rastislav Skalský,Elena Moltchanova,Juraj Balkovič,Ligia B.

741,Unique chloride-sensing properties of WNK4 permit the distal nephron to modulate potassium homeostasis,2015-01-01,Kidney International,10.1038/KI.2015.289,"Dietary potassium deficiency activates thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransport along the distal nephron. This may explain, in part, the hypertension and cardiovascular mortality observed in individuals who consume a low-potassium diet. Recent data suggest that plasma potassium affects the distal nephron directly by influencing intracellular chloride, an inhibitor of the with-no-lysine kinase (WNK)-Ste20p-related proline- and alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) pathway. As previous studies used extreme dietary manipulations, we sought to determine whether the relationship between potassium and NaCl cotransporter (NCC) is physiologically relevant and clarify the mechanisms involved. We report that modest changes in both dietary and plasma potassium affect NCC in vivo. Kinase assay studies showed that chloride inhibits WNK4 kinase activity at lower concentrations than it inhibits activity of WNK1 or WNK3. Also, chloride inhibited WNK4 within the range of distal cell chloride concentration. Mutation of a previously identified WNK chloride-binding motif converted WNK4 effects on SPAK from inhibitory to stimulatory in mammalian cells. Disruption of this motif in WNKs 1, 3, and 4 had different effects on NCC, consistent with the three WNKs having different chloride sensitivities. Thus, potassium effects on NCC are graded within the physiological range, which explains how unique chloride-sensing properties of WNK4 enable it to mediate effects of potassium on NCC in vivo.","WNK4,WNK1,Potassium channel,Potassium,Medicine,Kinase activity,Intracellular,Internal medicine,Endocrinology,Distal convoluted tubule,Dietary Potassium,Biochemistry,WNK4,WNK1,WNK Lysine-Deficient Protein Kinase 1,Surgery,Sodium,Potassium,Wild type,WNK4,WNK1,WNK Lysine-Deficient Protein Kinase 1,Potassium channel,Potassium,Signal transduction,Physics,Membrane,WNK4,WNK1,WNK Lysine-Deficient Protein Kinase 1,WNK4,WNK1,Renin–angiotensin system,WNK4,WNK1,Sodium,Symporter,SGK1,Phosphorylation,WNK4,WNK1,Protein kinase A","Andrew S.

In developed countries, new agroecosystem designs for MFA are appearing rapidly, but adoptions are limited. We present a heuristic strategy for increasing the adoption of MFA through development of new enterprises that enable farmers to profit from production of both agricultural commodities and ecological services. We propose that such enterprises can arise through feedback between social and biophysical systems operating across a range of scales. Such feedback depends on coordinated innovation among economic actors in a range of interdependent social sectors, supported by new “subsystems” that produce site-specific agroecological knowledge, and by change in the encompassing “supersystem” of public opinion and policy. This strategy can help guide efforts to increase the adoption of MFA.","Sustainable development,Profit (economics),Interdependence,Industrial organization,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Economic sector,Ecology,Biology,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Negative carbon dioxide emission,Monoculture,Greenhouse gas,Omnivore,Natural history,Ethnology,Public health law,Politics,Political science,Sustainability research,Sustainability,Situated,Soil carbon,Radiative forcing,Methane,Total human ecosystem,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Environmental resource management,Vegetation,Umbrella species,Measurement of biodiversity,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Good agricultural practice,Food systems,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Social movement,Soft systems methodology,Social learning,Resource management","Nicholas Jordan,Keith Douglass Warner,David Tilman,Jason D Hill,Clarence Lehman,Michael Pollan,Marion Nestle,B.

743,Designing cropping systems from nature,2011-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-011-0027-Z,"Despite huge gains in productivity, environmental impacts of industrial agriculture based on a few high-yielding crop cultivars and the massive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides have led to a search for new pathways leading to more sustainable agriculture in both temperate and tropical regions. New strategies incorporating ecological knowledge gained from the observation of natural ecosystems is an alternative to design “ecologically intensive” agroecosystems. Such systems are indeed both ecological and productive. Designing ecologically intensive agroecosystems calls for in-depth knowledge of biological regulations in ecosystems, and for the integration of traditional agricultural knowledge held by local farmers. This article reviews the main initiatives underlying ecologically intensive agroecosystems, analyses basic concepts, and proposes a framework for action. The rainforest model, the dry forest model, and the American Prairie are exemplified as three main natural systems at the basis of the mimicry concept. The link between biodiversity and the mimicry hypotheses, and the use of the concepts of productivity, efficiency, stability, and resilience for agroecosystems are discussed. Six main principles for cropping system design based on natural ecosystem mimicry are identified. A three-step framework for action is proposed, including nature observation, experimental design, and participatory design. Although far from being a panacea, the mimicry approach can provide new ways for agroecosystem design both in temperate and tropical countries.","Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Participatory design,Intensive farming,Cropping,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agroecological restoration,Agriculture,Total human ecosystem,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Socio-ecological system,Regime shift,Psychological resilience,Total human ecosystem,Species diversity,Geography,Woodland,Windbreak,Part iii,Sustainable agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Sustainability,Species richness,Species diversity,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource,Species richness,Primary productivity,Plant diversity,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services","Eric Malézieux,D.

744,Agroecology as a territory in dispute: between institutionality and social movements,2018-01-01,The Journal of Peasant Studies,10.1080/03066150.2017.1353496,"Agroecology is in fashion, and now constitutes a territory in dispute between social movements and institutionality. This new conjuncture offers a constellation of opportunities that social movements can avail themselves of to promote changes in the food system. Yet there is an enormous risk that agroecology will be co-opted, institutionalized, colonized and stripped of its political content. In this paper, we analyze this quandary in terms of political ecology: will agroecology end up as merely offering a few more tools for the toolbox of industrial agriculture, to fine tune an agribusiness system that is being restructured in the midst of a civilizational crisis or, alternatively, will it be strengthened as a politically mobilizing option for building alternatives to development? We interpret the contemporary dispute over agroecology through the lenses of contested material and immaterial territories, political ecology, and the first and second contradictions of capital.","Sociology,Social movement,Politics,Political ecology,Food systems,Development economics,Agroecology,Agribusiness,Accumulation by dispossession,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Uneven and combined development,Spanish Civil War,Sociology,There is no alternative,Sociology,Social science,Crop yield,Crop,Biology,Rural development,Property rights,Land tenure,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant,Sustainable development,Rural sociology,Politics,Third world,Problematization,Poverty,Temperate climate,Physical geography,Global Map,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture","Omar Felipe Giraldo,Peter M.

However, despite anthelmintic use as the predominant control strategy, extreme parasite infection cases are appearing in sheep and goat production; these impact productivity and have show mortality rates reaching pre-drug use levels. This was a predictable situation resulting from the loss of efficacy by all available products, particularly when some products were used as the sole intervention. The concepts of agroecology and holistic agriculture, which advocate the use of integrated management strategies, such as target selected treatment, herbal medicine, and the application of other parasite control alternatives, are not completely new, but are undergoing a resurgence because of their more sustainable appeal. The objective of this review article is to examine the problem of parasite control in the face of parasite drug resistance and to outline some strategies that may be used in parasite control programmes. Before they are accepted and recommended by the WAAVP, agroecological methods such as those listed above and described in detail herein should be validated based on scientific evidence of their efficacy for parasite control and should be tested for both host and environmental safety.","Sustainable agriculture,Scientific evidence,Review article,Livestock,Drug resistance,Biotechnology,Biology,Antiparasitic agent,Agroecology,Agriculture",Marcelo Beltrão Molento,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093240404,110,Agroecology Permit Emissions Greenhouse gas Offset

The sowing area of wheat varies between 1,0-1,2 million ha. The Hungarian country average yield of wheat was 5,0-5,5 t ha in the 1980’s but nowadays the average yield varies between 3,05,0 t ha depending on the climatic factors of cropyear. Many foreign and Hungarian experimental results of scientific papers proved that the climatic conditions of cropyears strongly modified the yield of wheat (Pepo 2004, Pepo 2005), the yield-stability (PepoGyiri 2005, Balla et al. 2006) and the baking quality (Pepo et al. 2005, Szentpetery et al. 2005a, Szentpetery et al. 2005b) too, even in favourable, intensive agrotechnical circumstances. The nutrient supply has a determinative role in sustainable wheat production (Pepo 2004). It is possible to reduce the unfavourable, negative agroecological, weather effects by using optimum nutrient supply, fertilization (Pepo 2002) and appropriate variety-selection (Agoston-Pepo 2005).","Winter wheat,Sowing,Nutrient,Human fertilization,Genotype,Crop production,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Winter wheat,Pesticide residue,Biology,Photosynthesis,Drought tolerance,Drought stress,Vegetation,Precipitation,Plant physiology,Winter wheat,Long-term experiment,Biology,Winter wheat,Long-term experiment,Human fertilization","Péter Pepó,Zs Szentpétery,Z.

747,How agro-ecological research helps to address food security issues under new IPM and pesticide reduction policies for global crop production systems,2011-01-01,Journal of Experimental Botany,10.1093/JXB/ERR064,": Drivers behind food security and crop protection issues are discussed in relation to food losses caused by pests. Pests globally consume food estimated to feed an additional one billion people. Key drivers include rapid human population increase, climate change, loss of beneficial on-farm biodiversity, reduction in per capita cropped land, water shortages, and EU pesticide withdrawals under policies relating to 91/414 EEC. IPM (Integrated Pest Management) will be compulsory for all EU agriculture by 2014 and is also being widely adopted globally. IPM offers a 'toolbox' of complementary crop- and region-specific crop protection solutions to address these rising pressures. IPM aims for more sustainable solutions by using complementary technologies. The applied research challenge now is to reduce selection pressure on single solution strategies, by creating additive/synergistic interactions between IPM components. IPM is compatible with organic, conventional, and GM cropping systems and is flexible, allowing regional fine-tuning. It reduces pests below economic thresholds utilizing key 'ecological services', particularly biocontrol. A recent global review demonstrates that IPM can reduce pesticide use and increase yields of most of the major crops studied. Landscape scale 'ecological engineering', together with genetic improvement of new crop varieties, will enhance the durability of pest-resistant cultivars (conventional and GM). IPM will also promote compatibility with semiochemicals, biopesticides, precision pest monitoring tools, and rapid diagnostics. These combined strategies are urgently needed and are best achieved via multi-disciplinary research, including complex spatio-temporal modelling at farm and landscape scales. Integrative and synergistic use of existing and new IPM technologies will help meet future food production needs more sustainably in developed and developing countries, in an era of reduced pesticide availability. Current IPM research gaps are identified and discussed.","Sustainability,Integrated pest management,Food security,Food safety,Ecology,Ecological engineering,Crop protection,Biology,Agroecology,Agriculture,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation,Population,Pest control,Ostrinia,Total human ecosystem,Temporal scales,Spatial ecology,Population,Miridae,Integrated pest management,Intercropping,Geography,Facilitation,Species richness,Species diversity,Spatial ecology","A.

To analyze the adaptive strategies of species, genotypes and cultivars, we aim both (i) to understand the composition and functioning of natural grasslands and (ii) to propose ideotypes of cultivars and optimal composition for mixtures of species/genotypes under water deficit and high temperatures. This review presents a conceptual framework to analyze adaptive responses of perennial herbaceous species, starting from resistance to moderate drought with growth maintenance (dehydration avoidance and tolerance of lamina) to growth cessation and survival of plants under severe stress (dehydration avoidance and tolerance of meristems). The most discriminating functional traits vary according to these contrasting strategies because of a trade-off between resistance to moderate moisture deficit and survival of intense drought. Consequently it is crucial to measure the traits of interest in the right organs and as a function of soil water use, in order to avoid misleading interpretations of plant responses. Furthermore, collaboration between ecologists, eco-physiologists, and agronomists is required to study the combination of plant strategies in natural grasslands as only this will provide the necessary rules for species and cultivars or ecotypes assemblage. This ‘agro-ecological’ approach aims to identify and enhance functional complementarity and limit competition within the multi-specific or multi-genotypic material associated in mixtures since using plant biodiversity should contribute to improving grassland resistance and resilience.","Sustainability,Perennial plant,Grassland,Global warming,Ecotype,Ecology,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Adaptive strategies,Total human ecosystem,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Temperate climate,Greenhouse effect,Environmental science,Unified neutral theory of biodiversity,Storage effect,Species diversity,Relative growth rate,Photosynthetic acclimation,Phenotypic plasticity,Sustainability,Species richness,Species diversity,The Renaissance,Predation,Foundation species,Habitat,Grassland,Functional diversity,Species richness,Primary productivity,Plant diversity,Plant diversity,Niche complementarity,Niche,Plant growth,Plant community,Mainstream","Florence Volaire,Karim Barkaoui,Mark Norton,D.

Conservation agriculture (CA) is promoted as an alternative to restore soil productivity through increased water and nutrient use efficiencies in these regions. However, adoption of CA is low due to a number of technical reasons, but fundamentally due to the fact that CA has been often promoted as a package, without proper adaptation to local circumstances. Farmers engagement in designing and implementing locally suited CA practices, as part of a long term strategy of soil rehabilitation is the core approach followed by the ABACO initiative, which brings together scientists and practitioners from West, East and Southern Africa coordinated through the African Conservation Tillage Network (www.act-africa.org). ABACO relies on agro-ecologically intensive measures for soil rehabilitation and increased water productivity in semi-arid regions, implemented, tested and disseminated through local co-innovation platforms. Rather than using rigid definitions of CA approaches that might not work in all sites, ABACO proposes to explore best engagement approaches for different sites. Simulation modelling is used as a support of long-term cross scale tradeoffs analysis from field to farms and territories, in order to inform effective policy-making. Preliminary results form the field are used here to illustrate and discuss the principles of ABACO, which may apply as well to regions other than semi-arid Africa.","Tillage,Soil retrogression and degradation,Food insecurity,Environmental resource management,Effects of global warming,Conservation agriculture,Biology,Arid,Agronomy,Agroecology,Aggradation,Lysimeter,Irrigation management,Evapotranspiration,Sustainable agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Variables,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Technological innovation system,Technological change,Technical change,Sustainability,Productive capacity,Ecosystem services,Technical performance,Resource allocation,Politics,Rural poverty,Resource management,Poverty,Sowing,Soil quality,Soil management,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil organic matter,Soil fertility,Sustainable development,Poverty,Natural resource management","Pablo Tittonell,Eric Scopel,Nadine Andrieu,Héléna Posthumus,P.

754,"Livelihood strategies, resilience and transformability in African agroecosystems",2014-01-01,Agricultural Systems,10.1016/J.AGSY.2013.10.010,"Aiming to translate resilience thinking theory into farming systems design practice, this paper examines fundamental properties of complex systems dynamics and their relation with the mechanisms that govern resilience and transformability in African smallholder agriculture. Agroecosystems dynamics emerge from the aggregation of diverse livelihood strategies in response to changes in the agroecosystem context, and are characterised by non-linearity, irreversibility, convergence/divergence and hysteresis. I examine a number of case studies from Africa to verify three guiding hypotheses in connection to the diversity of rural livelihood strategies: (1) diversity as alternative system regimes; (2) diversity as the result of transformability; (3) diversity determined by changing agricultural contexts. The hierarchy of constraints that determine the space for manoeuvring in agroecosystems is described through the analogy of the Matryoshka nesting dolls: each system level confines and is confined by their immediate sub- and supra-systems. Agricultural contexts, as defined by agro-ecological potential, demography and market connectivity are also dynamic and their trajectory can be described as shifts across stability domains. An example from Kenya shows that household diversity can be described as alternative system regimes, through hysteretic rather than continuous, reversible models. In some particular cases diversity emerges from divergent pathways that may have implied radical transformations in the past, as shown here for rural livelihoods in northern Cameroun. A comparative analysis of East African agroecosystems shows that thresholds in specific variables that may point to the existence of possible tipping points are rather elusive and largely site specific, requiring systematic categorisation of agricultural contexts. While agroecology needs to provide the knowledge base for the ecological intensification of smallholder landscapes, policy and market developments are needed to deal with the Matryoshka effect – or with interactions that are presumably panarchical in certain cases. Desirable shifts in farming systems can only be stimulated by working on both ends simultaneously.","Psychological resilience,Livelihood,Knowledge base,Hierarchy,Economics,Analogy,Alternative stable state,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Title,Law,Land titling,Regime shift,Psychological resilience,Habitat fragmentation,Socio-ecological system,Regime shift,Psychological resilience,Socio-ecological system,Social system,Social ecology,Socio-ecological system,Psychological resilience,Panarchy,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Soil management,Tragedy of the commons,Systematic risk,Risk management,Socio-ecological system,Psychological resilience,Perception,Work in process,Viewpoints,Spite,Socioeconomics,Poverty trap,Poverty reduction","Pablo Tittonell,Hernando de Soto,Marten Scheffer,Steve Carpenter,Jonathan A.

Here, we examined long term trends in the arable weed flora of North-East France by revisiting 158 arable fields initially surveyed in the 1970s. We assessed changes in species richness, density and frequency of occurrence in weed communities as well as for subgroups that are recognised for their conservation value. We also evaluated the importance of crop edges as potential refugia for the threatened arable weeds. Among the 121 species recorded in both surveys, 40% had significantly declined in frequency while 10% had significantly increased. At the field level, we recorded a 42% decline in species richness and a 67% decline in species density. Trends were comparable for weed species of particular conservation value. In the 2000s survey, crop edges harboured levels of weed diversity that were intermediate between those found in field cores in the 1970s and in the 2000s survey. Our results indicated that many species of conservation value had disappeared or seriously decreased in the field core but still persisted in the crop edge. The consequences of this general decline and possible conservation options are discussed in the light of the results.","Weed,Threatened species,Species richness,Plant community,Ecology,Crop,Biology,Biodiversity,Arable land,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Geography,Ecosystem diversity,Ecosystem,Vegetation dynamics,Plant ecology,Botany,Weed control,Weed,Trophic level,Surface runoff,Soil organic matter,Land use,Wildlife conservation,Population decline,Population,Zoology,Rare species,Metapopulation,Plant ecology,Indicator value,Forestry,Species diversity,Metacommunity,Geography,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Wildlife,Weed control,Weed","Guillaume Fried,Sandrine Petit,Fabrice Dessaint,Xavier Reboud,Kumar Duraiappah,Naeem,S.,Wri,Millennium Ecosystems Assessment Board,H.

We propose that agro-successional restoration, which we define as incorporating a range of agroecology and agroforestry techniques as a transition phase early in forest restoration, could be used more widely to overcome socioeconomic and ecological obstacles to restoring these lands. Over centuries, farmers and scientists have developed various agroforestry techniques that aim to cultivate crops and trees, in a range of crop types, time periods of cultivation (a few years to several decades), and complexity of species planted. The management practices used in these systems, such as weeding and increasing soil fertility, parallel those used in many forest restoration efforts. The synergism between these approaches is evidenced by many existing agro-successional examples currently used by smallholders in the tropics. Benefits of the agro-successional model include extending the management period of restoration, offsetting some management costs, providing food security for small landholders, and involving small landholders in the restoration process.","Tropics,Restoration ecology,Livelihood,Land use,Forest restoration,Food security,Ecology,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Secondary forest,Mycoforestry,Intact forest landscape,Silver bullet,Natural resource economics,Livelihood,Payment for ecosystem services,Payment,Opportunity cost,Tropics,Rural poverty,Reforestation,Specialty coffee,Organic coffee,Livelihood,Tourism,Rural settlement,Rural poverty,Urbanization,Tropics,Secondary forest,Tropics,Rainforest,Nature reserve,Vegetation,Soil fertility,Seed dispersal,Temporal scales,Restoration ecology,Psychological resilience","Daniel L.

757,Bioluminescent human breast cancer cell lines that permit rapid and sensitive in vivo detection of mammary tumors and multiple metastases in immune deficient mice,2005-01-01,Breast Cancer Research,10.1186/BCR1026,"Our goal was to generate xenograft mouse models of human breast cancer based on luciferase-expressing MDA-MB-231 tumor cells that would provide rapid mammary tumor growth; produce metastasis to clinically relevant tissues such as lymph nodes, lung, and bone; and permit sensitive in vivo detection of both primary and secondary tumor sites by bioluminescent imaging. Two clonal cell sublines of human MDA-MB-231 cells that stably expressed firefly luciferase were isolated following transfection of the parental cells with luciferase cDNA. Each subline was passaged once or twice in vivo to enhance primary tumor growth and to increase metastasis. The resulting luciferase-expressing D3H1 and D3H2LN cells were analyzed for long-term bioluminescent stability, primary tumor growth, and distal metastasis to lymph nodes, lungs, bone and soft tissues by bioluminescent imaging. Cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of nude and nude-beige mice or were delivered systemically via intracardiac injection. Metastasis was also evaluated by ex vivo imaging and histologic analysis postmortem. The D3H1 and D3H2LN cell lines exhibited long-term stable luciferase expression for up to 4–6 months of accumulative tumor growth time in vivo. Bioluminescent imaging quantified primary mammary fat pad tumor development and detected early spontaneous lymph node metastasis in vivo. Increased frequency of spontaneous lymph node metastasis was observed with D3H2LN tumors as compared with D3H1 tumors. With postmortem ex vivo imaging, we detected additional lung micrometastasis in mice with D3H2LN mammary tumors. Subsequent histologic evaluation of tissue sections from lymph nodes and lung lobes confirmed spontaneous tumor metastasis at these sites. Following intracardiac injection of the MDA-MB-231-luc tumor cells, early metastasis to skeletal tissues, lymph nodes, brain and various visceral organs was detected. Weekly in vivo imaging data permitted longitudinal analysis of metastasis at multiple sites simultaneously. Ex vivo imaging data from sampled tissues verified both skeletal and multiple soft tissue tumor metastasis. This study characterized two new bioluminescent MDA-MB-231-luc human breast carcinoma cell lines with enhanced tumor growth and widespread metastasis in mice. Their application to current xenograft models of breast cancer offers rapid and highly sensitive detection options for preclinical assessment of anticancer therapies in vivo.","Primary tumor,Pathology,Micrometastasis,Metastasis,Medicine,Mammary tumor,Lymph,In vivo,Ex vivo,Cancer research,Cancer,Primary tumor,Population,Metastasis,Vascular endothelial growth factor,Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor,Sunitinib malate,Transcriptome,Regulation of gene expression,Population,Reporter gene,Molecular biology,Luciferase,Preclinical imaging,Pathology,Magnetic resonance imaging,Sunitinib malate,Receptor tyrosine kinase,Osteolysis,Pathology,Mitomycin C,Metastasis,Metastasis,Internal medicine,Insulin-like growth factor,Pathology,Metastasis,Medicine,Pathology,Osteolysis,Minimal residual disease","Darlene E Jenkins,Yvette S Hornig,Yoko Oei,Joan Dusich,Tony Purchio,Yibin Kang,Peter M.

The rice yield in this production system is highly variable. A survey was conducted during the kharif seasons of 2011 and 2012, comprising 320 randomly selected farmers covering all the major agroclimatic regions of Punjab State of India to understand the cultural practices, farmers' perceptions, and reasons for the yield gap in DSR. Farmers used seeding rates from 15 to 40kgha-1, depending upon the type of seed drill used and agroecological conditions. About 65% of the farmers used drills with inclined plates, a seed-metering device, and on a "" custom hiring"" basis. More than 90% of the farmers chose cultivars for dry seeding by considering their yield potential, suitability to agroecological zones, and being easy to sell. Among the farmers surveyed, about 45% of them adhered to recommended practices of fertilizer application. Weeds were reported as the main biological constraints in DSR culture. Only 46% of the farmers applied both pre- and postemergence herbicides for weed control. About 67% of the farmers used flood jet or cone-type nozzles for herbicide spray, resulting in additional hand-weeding by 42% of the farmers due to poor weed control. The survey revealed that non-adherence to a recommended fertilizer schedule and weed control package (appropriate herbicides, optimum application time of herbicides, optimum volume of water for spraying, and selection of the right nozzles) is one of the reasons for the existing yield gap. Site-specific agrotechnologies for DSR need to be developed and transferred to farmers to achieve high yield. The survey also revealed that tailoring cultivars for dry-seeding conditions is needed for further productivity gains in DSR.","Yield gap,Weed control,Weed,Water scarcity,Seed drill,Kharif crop,Fertilizer,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Water table,Water storage,Water resources,Water-use efficiency,Total factor productivity,Soil water,Weedy rice,Weed control,Transplanting,Water use,Water supply,Water resources,Weed control,Weed,Transplanting,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Water scarcity,Weed control,Weed,Tillage,Water use,Water scarcity,Water resources,Sugar,Starch,Sowing","G.

However, little is known about the potential for local food systems to scale beyond niche markets and meet a substantial fraction of total food demand. Here we estimate the upper potential for all existing US croplands to meet total US food demand through local food networks. Our spatially explicit approach simulates the years 1850 through 2000 and accounts for a wide range of diets, food waste, population distributions, cropland areas, and crop yields. Although we find that local food potential has declined over time, particularly in some coastal cities, our results also demonstrate an unexpectedly large current potential for meeting as much as 90% of the national food demand. This decline in potential is associated with demographic and agronomic trends, resulting in extreme pressures on agroecological systems that, if left unchecked, could severely undermine recent national policies focused on...","Water resources,Nutrient,Niche,Food waste,Food systems,Food security,Ecology,Crop yield,Biology,Agroecology,Greenhouse gas,Food processing,Food miles,Sociology,Food systems,Environmental resource management,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Rhetoric,Sociology,Social constructionism,Short food supply chains,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Social movement,Reuse,Population,Phosphorus cycle,Unit of analysis,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Sustainability,Status quo,Sociology,Urbanization,Natural resource economics,Food systems,Sustainability,Population,Operations management","Andrew Zumkehr,J Elliott Campbell,Christopher L.

760,"Social sustainability, farm labor, and organic agriculture: Findings from an exploratory analysis",2006-01-01,Agriculture and Human Values,10.1007/S10460-006-9016-2,"Much of the attention by social scientists to the rapidly growing organic agriculture sector focuses on the benefits it provides to consumers (in the form of pesticide-free foods) and to farmers (in the form of price premiums). By contrast, there has been little discussion or research about the implications of the boom in organic agriculture for farmworkers on organic farms. In this paper, we ask the question: From the perspective of organic farmers, does “certified organic” agriculture encompass a commitment to “sustainability” that prioritizes social goals? Specifically, we aim to broaden our understanding of the relationship between social sustainability and organic agriculture by drawing attention to issues affecting farmworkers, whose labor and contribution tends to elude most discussions of organic agriculture. We present findings from a survey of organic farmers in California about the possible incorporation of social standards into organic certification criteria. Our findings suggest that, at best, lukewarm support for social certification within organic agriculture exists among certified organic farmers in California. They also question expectations that organic agriculture necessarily fosters social or even economic sustainability for most of the farmers and farmworkers involved. However, we also find exceptions to the patterns evidenced in our survey. In-depth interviews with select organic farmers demonstrate that there are individuals whose practices are atypical and demonstrate that, under some circumstances, an organic production system can be at once environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable.

Typically these crops are grown as monocultures or simple graminoid-legume bicultures; however, ecological theory and empirical evidence suggest that agroecosystem services could be enhanced by growing cover crops in species-rich mixtures. We examined cover crop productivity, weed suppression, stability, and carryover effects to a subsequent cash crop in an experiment involving a five-species annual cover crop mixture and the component species grown as monocultures in SE New Hampshire, USA in 2011 and 2012. The mean land equivalent ratio (LER) for the mixture exceeded 1.0 in both years, indicating that the mixture over-yielded relative to the monocultures. Despite the apparent over-yielding in the mixture, we observed no enhancement in weed suppression, biomass stability, or productivity of a subsequent oat (Avena sativa L.) cash crop when compared to the best monoculture component crop. These data are some of the first to include application of the LER to an analysis of a cover crop mixture and contribute to the growing literature on the agroecological effects of cover crop diversity in cropping systems.","Weed,Monoculture,Environmental science,Crop,Cover crop,Cash crop,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Agriculture,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Species diversity,Science policy,Molecular interactions,Trophic level,Species richness,Global biodiversity,Species diversity,Spatial heterogeneity,Population,Psychological resilience,Monoculture,Incentive,Species richness,Population,Plant community,Sorghum,Soil organic matter,Nutrient cycle,Standard deviation,Portfolio effect,Portfolio,Vegetation dynamics,Vegetation,Plant species,Weed control,Weed,Intercropping","Richard G.

762,The compatibility of agricultural intensification in a global hotspot of smallholder agrobiodiversity (Bolivia),2013-01-01,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/PNAS.1216294110,Integrating the conservation of biodiversity by smallholder farmers with agricultural intensification is increasingly recognized as a leading priority of sustainability and food security amid global environmental and socioeconomic change. An international research project investigated the smallholder agrobiodiversity of maize (corn) in a global hotspot (Bolivia) undergoing significant intensification. Peach-based intensification was pronounced (300–400%) and prolonged (2000–2010) in study areas. Intensification and maize agrobiodiversity were found to co-occur within smallholder landscapes. Interactions of these field systems did not trigger land-change tipping points leading to landrace extirpation. By 2010 maize landraces in the study areas still demonstrated high levels of taxonomic and ecological biodiversity and contributed significantly to this crop’s agrobiodiversity at national (31%) and hemispheric (3%) scales. Social and ecological resilience and in situ conservation of the maize agrobiodiversity by Bolivian smallholders was enabled through robust linkages to off-farm migration; resource access and asset capabilities among both traditional and nontraditional growers; landrace agroecology and food uses; and innovative knowledge and skills. The smallholders’ resilience resulting from these linkages was integral to the conditional success of the in situ conservation of maize agrobiodiversity. Environment–development interactions both enabled smallholders’ agrobiodiversity resilience and influenced the limits and vulnerability of agrobiodiversity.

763,Explaining the 'hungry farmer paradox': Smallholders and fair trade cooperatives navigate seasonality and change in Nicaragua's corn and coffee markets,2014-01-01,Global Environmental Change-human and Policy Dimensions,10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2014.02.005,"A B S T R A C T Latin American smallholder coffee farmers linked with fair trade and organic markets are frequently cited as models for sustainable food systems. Yet many experience seasonal hunger, which is a very common, but understudied, form of food insecurity. Northern Nicaragua’s highlands include wellorganized cooperatives, high rural poverty rates, and rain dependent farms, offering a compelling study area to understand what factors are associated with seasonal hunger. This participatory mixed methods study combines data from observations, interviews and focus groups with results from a survey of 244 cooperative members. It finds that seasonal hunger is influenced by multiple factors, including: (1) annual cycles of precipitation and rising maize prices during the lean months; (2) inter annual droughts and periodic storms; and (3) the long-term inability of coffee harvests and prices to provide sufficient income. Sampled households experienced an average of about 3 months of seasonal hunger in 2009. A series of five least squares regression models find the expected significant impacts of corn harvest quantity, farm area, improved grain storage, and household incomes, all inversely correlated with lean months. Unanticipated results include the finding that households with more fruit trees reported fewer lean months, while the predominant environmentally friendly farming practices had no discernable impacts. The presence of hunger among producers challenges sustainable coffee marketing claims. We describe one example of a partnership-based response that integrates agroecological farm management with the use of fair trade cooperative institutions to re-localize the corn distribution system. Increased investments and integrated strategies will be needed to reduce threats to food security, livelihoods, and biodiversity associated with the rapid spread of coffee leaf rust and falling commodity prices.","Sustainable agriculture,Rural poverty,Livelihood,Food systems,Food security,Fair trade,Economics,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,World Wide Web,Qualitative research,Qualitative property,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Syntax,Sociology,Norm (social),Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Subsistence agriculture,Rural management,Rural economics,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Social influence,Soil science,Population,Organic farming,Sustainable livelihood,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Rural sociology,Prevalence,Nutritional status,Micronutrient","Christopher M.

Indeed legumes provide plant proteins for animal feed and human food. Legumes fix atmospheric N2 and, in turn, provide cheap and green N fertilisers. Additionally, legumes are used as diversification crops in rotations based on oilseed rape and cereals. Despite those benefits, legume crops in Europe represent less than 4 % of arable lands, and European legume seeds are underused for animal and human nutrition. Nonetheless, European authorities are now fostering the development of legume crops for sustainable agriculture. Here, we analyse forage and grain legume-producing systems since 1950 in order to identify the actual constraints of legume development. We show that legumes can contribute to the agroecological transition for sustainable agriculture, food and energy and for sustainable agri-food systems. Then, we point out that high added-value niche markets are required for supporting legume production. The major research needs identified are (1) analysing the constraints of the current systems and identifying ways of moving towards systems that include more legumes, (2) identifying new and diversified uses for legumes in a sustainable food chain, (3) assessing and improving the ecosystem services provided by legumes at cropping system and territory scales and (4) promoting agroecology through and for legume crop management.","Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Legume,Ecosystem services,Cropping system,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Symbiosis,Root microbiome,Rhizosphere,Returns to scale,Path dependence,Path creation,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Sociology,User requirements document,Technological transitions,Technological innovation system,Total human ecosystem,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Environmental resource management,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Literature survey,Ecosystem services,Resource scarcity,Property rights,Natural resource economics,Systems of innovation,Scrutiny,Path dependence,Sustainable management,Intensive farming,Integrated pest management","Anne-Sophie Voisin,Jacques Guéguen,Christian Huyghe,Marie-Helene Jeuffroy,Marie-Benoît Magrini,Jean Marc Meynard,Christophe Mougel,Sylvain Pellerin,Elise Pelzer,Harsh P.

Yet, the role of the environment, including biotic forces such as microbial and insect communities, in contributing to crop phenotypes under domestication and diversification has been poorly explored. In particular, there has been limited progress in understanding how human selection, agricultural cultivation (soil disturbance, fertilization, and irrigation), and biotic forces act as selective pressures on crop phenotypes. For example, geographically-structured pathogenic, pestiferous, and mutualistic interactions with crop plants have likely given rise to landraces that interact differently with local microbial and insect communities. In order to understand the adaptive role of crop traits, we argue that more studies should be conducted in the geographic centers of origin to test hypotheses on how abiotic, biotic, and human selective forces have shaped the phenotypes of domesticated plants during crop domestication and subsequent diversification into landraces. In these centers of origin, locally endemic species associated with wild ancestors have likely contributed to the selection on plant phenotypes. We address a range of questions that can only be studied in the geographic center of crop origin, placing emphasis on Mesoamerican polyculture systems, and highlight the significance of in situ studies for increasing the sustainability of modern agricultural systems.","Plant evolution,Evolutionary ecology,Ecology,Domestication,Diversification (marketing strategy),Botany,Biology,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural diversification,Abiotic component,Soil biology,Root microbiome,Rhizosphere,Sustainable agriculture,Root microbiome,Rhizosphere,The Conceptual Framework,Natural selection,Metapopulation,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Transgenerational epigenetics,Macroevolution,Lamarckism,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Population,Plant development,Molecular genetics,Genomics of domestication,Sociology,Evolutionary theory,Epistemology,Trichoderma,Soil microbiology,Organic farming,Western corn rootworm,Poaceae,PEST analysis","Yolanda H.

In this paper, we discuss how to complete an economic assessment of CBC. We also ask what the research and development (R&D) requirements are for CBC and the likelihood of that R&D being funded. We examine the factors that may influence uptake of CBC amongst farmers and consider what policies or strategies might be introduced to increase the incentive to adopt CBC. Relative advantage of CBC over other production systems, trialability (ease of informal field experimentation and learning before adoption) of CBC and the social dynamics of CBC development and extension are key factors influencing adoption. The most important social factors are the social learning processes to support agroecological practices, and the configuration of economic incentives to reward farmers for undertaking the transition to conservation biological control. By itself, neither social pressure to reduce insecticide use nor sophisticated scientific research guarantees expanded implementation of CBC.","Social learning,Social dynamics,Scientific method,Public economics,Natural enemies,Key factors,Incentive,Environmental resource management,Ecology,Cost–benefit analysis,Biology,Agroecology,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Sustainability,Soil indicators,Sociology,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation,restrict,Wildlife,Pollination,Sociology,Sociological theory of diffusion,Product innovation,Water holding capacity,Species diversity,Environmental science,Wildlife protection,Natural resource economics,Lucid dream,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Natural resource economics","Ross Cullen,Keith D.

New habitats can be created and existing ones improved with agri-environment scheme funding in all EU member states. Understanding the contribution of each habitat type can aid the development of conservation control strategies. Here we review the extent to which the predominant habitat types in Europe support natural enemies, whether this results in enhanced natural enemy densities in the adjacent crop and whether this leads to reduced pest densities. Considerable variation exists in the available information for the different habitat types and trophic levels. Natural enemies within each habitat were the most studied, with less information on whether they were enhanced in adjacent fields, while their impact on pests was rarely investigated. Most information was available for woody and herbaceous linear habitats, yet not for woodland which can be the most common semi-natural habitat in many regions. While the management and design of habitats offer potential to stimulate conservation biocontrol, we also identified knowledge gaps. A better understanding of the relationship between resource availability and arthropod communities across habitat types, the spatiotemporal distribution of resources in the landscape and interactions with other factors that play a role in pest regulation could contribute to an informed management of semi-natural habitats for biocontrol.","Woodland,Vegetation,Trophic level,Sustainable agriculture,PEST analysis,Integrated pest management,Habitat,Ecology,Biology,Agroecology,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Zoology,Toxicology,Toxicity,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation,Spatial heterogeneity,Moderation,Landscape epidemiology,Terrestrial ecosystem,Sustainable yield,Soil biodiversity,Species richness,Pest control,PEST analysis,Species diversity,Predation,Pesticide,Population size,Population fragmentation,Population,Population,Pest control,PEST analysis","John M.

The project is carried out in 14 sites in hunger and poverty hotspots in diverse agroecological zones in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The interventions and results for increasing staple crop yields are presented for eight MV sites and cover 52,000 farming households or 310,000 people. By supporting farmers with fertilizers, improved crop germplasm, and intensive training on appropriate agronomic practices, average yields of 3 t ha − 1 were exceeded in all sites where maize is the major crop. Teff yields doubled in the Ethiopian site. In contrast, there was little improvement in millet and groundnut yields in the semiarid and arid sites in West Africa. Over 75% of the farms had maize yields of 3 t ha − 1 and less than 10% of the households had yields lower than 2 t ha − 1 . Households produced enough maize to meet basic caloric requirements, with the exception of farms smaller than 0.2 ha in Sauri, Kenya. Value-to-cost ratios of 2 and above show that the investment in seed and fertilizer is profitable, provided surplus harvests were stored and sold at peak prices. Increased crop yields are the first step in the African Green Revolution, and must be followed by crop diversification for improving nutrition and generating income and a transition to market-based agriculture. A multisector approach that exploits the synergies among improved crop production, nutrition, health, and education is essential to achieving the MDGs.","Poverty,Millennium Development Goals,Green Revolution,Crop yield,Crop,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural diversification,Vulnerability,Sustainability,Latin Americans,User Friendly,Poverty,Operational framework,Sustainable agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Prevalence,Nutritional status,Micronutrient,Sierra leone,Poverty,Population,Tithonia,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil governance,Subsidy,Green Revolution,Government,Vulnerability,Geography,Environmental resource management,Sustainability,Small farm,Rural area,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Green Revolution","Generose Nziguheba,Cheryl A.

However, many currently used weed management approaches are increasingly unsustainable. To address this knowledge and practice gap, in June 2014, 35 weed and invasion ecologists, weed scientists, evolutionary biologists and social scientists convened a workshop to explore current and future perspectives and approaches in weed ecology and management. A horizon scanning exercise ranked a list of 124 pre‐submitted questions to identify a priority list of 30 questions. These questions are discussed under seven themed headings that represent areas for renewed and emerging focus for the disciplines of weed research and practice. The themed areas considered the need for transdisciplinarity, increased adoption of integrated weed management and agroecological approaches, better understanding of weed evolution, climate change, weed invasiveness and finally, disciplinary challenges for weed science. Almost all the challenges identified rested on the need for continued efforts to diversify and integrate agroecological, socio‐economic and technological approaches in weed management. These challenges are not newly conceived, though their continued prominence as research priorities highlights an ongoing intransigence that must be addressed through a more system‐oriented and transdisciplinary research agenda that seeks an embedded integration of public and private research approaches. This horizon scanning exercise thus set out the building blocks needed for future weed management research and practice; however, the challenge ahead is to identify effective ways in which sufficient research and implementation efforts can be directed towards these needs.","Weed control,Weed,Transdisciplinarity,Horizon scanning,Food security,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Discipline,Biology,Agroecology,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Threatened species,Invasive species,Introduced species,Societal perception,Scrutiny,Resource management,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide,Transformational leadership,Sustainable development,Sustainability science,Species richness,Species diversity,Plant community,Weed,Sustainable solutions,Resistance mutation,Yield gap,Population,Land use,Woody plant,Seed dispersal,Pollination","P Neve,J N Barney,Y Buckley,Roger D Cousens,Sonia Graham,N R Jordan,A Lawton-Rauh,M Liebman,M B Mesgaran,M Schut,J Shaw,J Storkey,B Baraibar,R S Baucom,M Chalak,D Z Childs,S Christensen,H Eizenberg,C Fernandez-Quintanilla,Kris French,Melanie Harsch,S Heijting,L Harrison,D Loddo,M Macel,N Maczey,A Merotto Jr,D Mortensen,J Necajeva,D A Peltzer,J Recasens,M Renton,M Riemens,M Sonderskov,M Williams,H.

771,REVIEW: Plant functional traits in agroecosystems: a blueprint for research,2015-01-01,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/1365-2664.12526,"Summary Functional trait-based ecological research has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of natural plant community dynamics. However, to date, principles of functional trait ecology have not been widely applied to agricultural research and management. Here, we discuss why and how a functional trait approach – distinct from a traditional agronomic trait approach that focuses strictly on crop yield components – can provide a valuable framework for agricultural research. We illustrate these points with an emphasis on commodity crops. The literature suggests a key role for functional trait-based research in understanding the causes and consequences of changes in agroecosystem structure and function. This includes novel approaches to understanding crop breeding and productivity, agroecosystem dynamics and non-crop biodiversity maintenance, the contributions of agroecosystems to global net primary productivity and other biogeochemical cycles, and agricultural vulnerability to climate change. We propose that a key step in advancing trait-based agricultural research is the consolidation of functional trait data for the world's most common crop and fodder species, the main commodities on ∼1·2 billion ha of land. Using Coffea arabica as an example, we show there is strong potential to populate a comprehensive data base of crop functional trait data. For C. arabica, there exist hundreds of observations for ecologically important ‘leaf economics’ and ‘root economics’ traits, either in smaller data bases or peer-reviewed studies, but these have not been consolidated. A similar opportunity for functional trait data consolidation exists for many of the world's most common crops. Synthesis and applications. A unified functional trait data base for just 65 of the world's most common agricultural crops can be used to provide baseline evaluations of the functional diversity across croplands covering ∼8·1% of the Earth's land surface. This functional trait data, and other trait-based research, could further be used to evaluate how changes in interspecific and intraspecific crop diversity are mechanistically linked with alterations in agroecosystem function. Ultimately, trait-based research that examines the causes and consequences of agricultural homogenization may contribute to more ecologically informed management of agricultural diversity, from genetic through to global scales.","Trait theory,Trait,Functional ecology,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Crop diversity,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Vegetation,Trait,Specific leaf area,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Realized niche width,Niche,Limiting similarity,Trophic level,Trait,Plant species,Vegetation,Trait,Species richness,Primary production,Plant cover,Land use,Sustainability,Stakeholder,Panacea (medicine),Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Litter,Ecosystem,Ecology,Zoning,Population growth,Food systems","Adam R.

772,Synergies between Agricultural Intensification and Climate Change Could Create Surprising Vulnerabilities for Crops,2008-01-01,BioScience,10.1641/B580911,"An inevitable consequence of global climate change is that altered patterns of temperature and precipitation threaten agriculture in many tropical regions, requiring strategies of human adaptation. Moreover, the process of management intensification in agriculture has increased and may exacerbate vulnerability to climate extremes. Although many solutions have been presented, the role of simple agroecological and agroforestry management has been largely ignored. Some recent literature has shown how sustainable management may improve agroecological resistance to extreme climate events. We comment specifically on a prevalent form of agriculture throughout Latin America, the coffee agroforestry system. Results from the coffee literature have shown that shade management in coffee systems may mitigate the effects of extreme temperature and precipitation, thereby reducing the ecological and economic vulnerability of many rural farmers. We conclude that more traditional forms of agriculture can offer greater potential for adapting to changing conditions than do current intensive systems.","Vulnerability,Tropics,Sustainable management,Political economy of climate change,Global warming,Climate change,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Regional science,Environmental science,Cross sectoral,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource,Total human ecosystem,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Environmental resource management,Specialty coffee,Organic coffee,Livelihood,Transpiration,Simulation modeling,Precipitation,Vegetation,Temperate climate,Species richness,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization,Tropical cyclone,Trend surface analysis,Time series,Ruderal species,Plant nutrition,Plant ecology","Brenda B.

The basic idea is that plant breeding is unlikely to improve attributes already favored by millions of years of natural selection, whereas there may be unutilized potential in selecting for attributes that increase total crop yield but reduce plants’ individual fitness. In other words, plant breeding should be based on group selection. We explore this approach in relation to crop-weed competition, and argue that it should be possible to develop high density cereals that can utilize their initial size advantage over weeds to suppress them much better than under current practices, thus reducing or eliminating the need for chemical or mechanical weed control. We emphasize the role of density in applying group selection to crops: it is competition among individuals that generates the ‘Tragedy of the Commons’, providing opportunities to improve plant production by selecting for attributes that natural selection would not favor. When there is competition for light, natural selection of individuals favors a defensive strategy of ‘shade avoidance’, but a collective, offensive ‘shading’ strategy could increase weed suppression and yield in the high density, high uniformity cropping systems we envision.","Weed,Natural selection,Mechanical weed control,Ideotype,Group selection,Ecology,Cropping,Biology,Agroecology,Agriculture","Jacob Weiner,Sven Bode Andersen,Wibke Kirsi-Marja Wille,Hans W.

776,Bioherbicides: Dead in the water? A review of the existing products for integrated weed management,2016-01-01,Crop Protection,10.1016/J.CROPRO.2016.04.016,"Abstract The intensive use of synthetic herbicides is questioned for many reasons. Bioherbicides, as integrated weed management tools, however, have the potential to offer a number of benefits such as increased target specificity and rapid degradation. Despite the efforts to identify effective bioherbicide agents in laboratory and field, only thirteen bioherbicides are currently available on the market. Since 1980, the number of biopesticides has increased around the world, while the market share of bioherbicides represents less than 10% of all biopesticides. Nevertheless, weed management implemented at the cropping systems scale needs bioherbicides because of legislation to drive weed management away from heavy reliance on chemicals, the global increase in organic agriculture, the need of both organic and conventional agriculture to increase weed control efficiency, concerns about herbicide resistance, and concern from the public about environmental safety of herbicides. Consequently, we review here the existing products on the market and describe their history, mode of action, efficacy and target weeds. This review is unique because we also discuss the role of bioherbicides in integrated weed management: to manage soil weed seedbanks with seed-targeted agents in addition to primary tillage, to increase the efficacy of mechanical weeding because bioherbicides are more effective on seedlings, to increase the suppression effect of crop cultivars by first slowing weed growth, to terminate cover crops particularly in conservation agriculture, and finally to manage herbicide resistant populations.","Weed control,Weed,Organic farming,Cover crop,Conservation agriculture,Botany,Biology,Bioherbicide,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide,European union,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Weed control,Weed,Trophic level,Weed,Poaceae,Phytotoxin,Weed control,Phytotoxin,Pesticide,Weed control,Pesticide use,Organic farming,Weed control,Weed,Phalaris minor,Weed control,Weed,Public policy,Pesticide,Legislature,Integrated pest management,Weed control,Soybean management practices,Soil fertility","Stéphane Cordeau,Marion Triolet,Sandra Wayman,Christian Steinberg,Jean-Philippe Guillemin,E.-C.

779,Sudden Shift or Migratory Drift? FulBe Herd Movements to the Sudano-Guinean Region of West Africa,2007-01-01,Human Ecology,10.1007/S10745-006-9067-4,"A significant change in the geography of livestock raising over the past 30 years is the southerly movement of FulBe herds into the humid Sudanian and Guinean savannas of West Africa. The literature suggests that the severe droughts of the early 1970s and mid-1980s were the driving force behind this southern expansion of mobile livestock raising. The conventional view is that drought forced herders to seek greener pastures to the south, an area that zebu cattle have previously avoided because of the presence of tsetse flies, the vector of animal sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). This “sudden push” hypothesis places Sahelian herds in savanna pastures in a matter of a 1–3 years. This stimulus-response model runs counter to our observations and understanding of the social and ecological processes influencing FulBe herd movements. We challenge the “sudden shift” thesis at the regional scale by arguing that the southerly expansion of FulBe herds has proceeded according to a more complex temporal frame that includes generational, biological, and social historical timeframes and periodicities. We distinguish between short-term shifts (“test movements”) and more permanent shifts (“migration movements”). These mobility patterns are linked to contingent factors such as cattle diseases, drought, and political instability, as well as to more structural and adaptive features such as the establishment of social networks, herding contracts, and cattle cross-breeding. Shifts in livestock ownership and the social differentiation among herders are important variables for understanding changes in herd movements. We conclude that the permanent shift of herds to the humid savannas of West Africa has been preceded by a series of social and agroecological adjustments that operate on decadal and generational time scales.","Zebu,Population,Pastoralism,Livestock,Herding,Herd,Environmental protection,Economics,Ecology,Climate change,Agroecology,Vegetation types,Vegetation,Miombo woodland,Vegetation,Rangeland,Plant community,Social science,Political ecology,Peasant,Social dynamics,Politics,Political economy,Wilderness,West african,West africa,Sociology,Population,Pastoralism,Rural area,Remuneration,Pastoralism,West africa,Spite,Public policy,West africa,Social network,Rural development,Sociology,Socioeconomic change,Population","Thomas J.

As with rice, the principles of early and healthy plant establishment, reducing competition between plants, increased soil organic matter, active soil aeration, and the careful application of water are proving able to raise the productivity and profitability of differently-managed crops. Recent reports from the World Bank in India and the Agricultural Transformation Agency in Ethiopia show such changes in crop management improving food security and being scaled up with hundreds of thousands of farmers.

781,"Impact of organic pig production systems on CO2 emission, C sequestration and nitrate pollution",2010-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1051/AGRO/2010006,"Organic rules for grazing and access to outdoor areas in pig production may be met in different ways, which express compromises between considerations for animal welfare, feed self-reliance and negative environmental impact such as greenhouse gas emissions and nitrate pollution. This article compares the environmental impact of the main organic pig systems in Denmark. Normally, sows are kept in huts on grassland and finishing pigs are raised in stables with access to an outdoor run. One alternative practice is also rearing the fattening pigs on grassland all year round. The third method investigated was a one-unit pen system mainly consisting of a deep litter area under a climate tent and with restricted access to a grazing area. Using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, the emissions of greenhouse gases of the free range system were estimated to be 3.3 kg CO2-equivalents kg−1 live weight pig, which was significantly higher than the indoor fattening system and the tent system, yielding 2.9 and 2.8 kg CO2-eq. kg−1 pig, respectively. This was 7–22% higher compared with Danish conventional pig production but, due to the integration of grass-clover in the organic crop rotations these had an estimated net soil carbon sequestration. When carbon sequestration was included in the LCA then the organic systems had lower greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional pig production. Eutrophication in nitrate equivalents per kg pig was 21–65% higher in the organic pig systems and acidification was 35–45% higher per kg organic pig compared with the conventional system. We conclude that, even though the free range system theoretically has agro-ecological advantages over the indoor fattening system and the tent system due to a larger grass-clover area, this potential is difficult to implement in practice due to problems with leaching on sandy soil. Only if forage can contribute to a larger proportion of the pigfeed uptake may the free range system be economically and environmentally competitive. Improvement of nitrogen cycling and efficiency is the most important factor for reducing the overall environmental load from organic pig meat. Presently, a system with pig fattening in stables and concrete-covered outdoor runs seems to be the best solution from an environmental point of view.","Pig farming,Organic farming,Life-cycle assessment,Greenhouse gas,Deep litter,Crop rotation,Carbon sequestration,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,World Reference Base for Soil Resources,USDA soil taxonomy,Subaqueous soil,Supply and demand,Operations research,Life-cycle assessment,Library science,Computer science,Water quality,Organic farming,Intensive farming,Organic farming,Life-cycle assessment,Land use,Water quality,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Pollution,Organic milk,Organic farming,Organic farming,Life-cycle assessment,Hectare,Manure,Livestock,Land use,Waste management,Soybean meal,Rapeseed","Niels Halberg,John E.

782,‘Sustainable de-growth’ in agriculture and food: an agro-ecological perspective on Spain’s agri-food system (year 2000),2012-01-01,Journal of Cleaner Production,10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2011.03.018,"Traditionally, energy balances in agrarian production have been used to calculate the impact of food on the Spanish economy in physical terms. However, this tool is clearly insufficient. Human diet has undergone significant changes in recent decades. Between production and consumption, previously nonexistent or insignificant processes such as transportation, packaging, processing, distribution, preservation, etc. have come to the fore. This article aims to evaluate the energy cost of the Spanish agri-food (AFS) system in the year 2000 with a view to ascertaining the relative importance of each link in the agrifood chain. This information is essential when it comes to designing any strategy for sustainable de-growth. The results of this research show that feeding the Spanish population is an inefficient process: the Spanish AFS currently consumes 1408 PJ, while all of its residents combined consume only 190 PJ. Agrarian production is effectively the main source of this inefficiency (34% of the primary energy consumed), but not the only one: processes such as the preservation and preparation of food in the home (18%), transportation (17%) and packaging (10%) show that the way we feed ourselves is not sustainable. The paper makes a strong point that a fundamental transformation of the AFS is required. A move towards organic farming and corresponding new consumption patterns (i.e., local, seasonal food, less meat consumption) may considerably reduce resource use in the AFS and contribute to sustainable de-growth in Spain.","Sustainable development,Primary energy,Organic farming,Food systems,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Economics,Ecological economics,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Agrarian society,Weak and strong sustainability,Sustainable development,Sustainability science,World population,Population growth,Population,Sustainable products,Life-cycle assessment,Information sharing,Sustainability,Social equality,Social dynamics,Sustainable agriculture,Short food supply chains,Scrutiny,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Social movement,Random parameter logit,Preference heterogeneity,Microeconomics,Water quality,Organic farming,Intensive farming,Soil organic matter,Organic matter,Organic farming,Organic farming,Intensive farming,Integrated farming","Juan Infante Amate,Manuel González de Molina,Gro Harlem Brundtland,Mansour Khalid,Fridolin Krausmann,Simone Gingrich,Nina Eisenmenger,Karl-Heinz Erb,Helmut Haberl,Poritosh Roy,Daisuke Nei,Takahiro Orikasa,Qingyi Xu,Hiroshi Okadome,François Schneider,Giorgos Kallis,Joan Martinez-Alier,Michael Winter,Joan Martínez-Alier,Unai Pascual,Franck-Dominique Vivien,Edwin Zaccai,Kelvin J.

783,The quality of sustainability: Agroecological partnerships and the geographic branding of California winegrapes,2007-01-01,Journal of Rural Studies,10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2006.09.009,"Abstract Quality and sustainability are both socially constructed, ambiguous terms, but they have not been heretofore linked in the rural studies literature. The “quality turn” has received particular attention from researchers for its potential to organize linkages among various forces in agrofood systems, providing more income to producers by appealing to affluent, reflexive consumers. A distinct line of rural research has attended to the challenge of agro-environmental pollution and regulation, but this research trajectory has been subsumed under the broader paradigm of sustainability. This article seeks to contribute to discussions about quality in the agrofood sector by analyzing the potential of fusing rural resource protection practices with place-based marketing of enhanced quality, drawing from an empirical study of the California winegrape industry. In several California commodities, agroecological partnerships are becoming the chief vehicle for extending sustainable agricultural practices. California's winegrape farmers have undertaken more partnerships to greater effect than those of any other US crop, and they are now discursively linking their sustainable farming practices, environmental quality, and wine quality. This marks a new linkage of two heretofore discrete social imaginaries. This article argues that “quality” is a term that can conceptually link increasing consumer demand for differentiated product taste with increasing regulatory pressure for environmental protection. Synergistic benefits from such a linkage have the potential to strengthen rural development initiatives. Making progress toward sustainability requires collective action on the part of producers, and in some commodities, may mesh well with efforts to enhance foodstuff quality.","Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Environmental resource management,Environmental quality,Empirical research,Economics,Collective action,Agroecology,Agriculture",Keith Douglass Warner,https://webpages.scu.edu/ftp/kwarner/WarnerJRSQualitySustainability.pdf,139,Agroecology Permit Emissions Greenhouse gas Offset

Their integration has provided a collective-action mode for contesting the dominant agro-food regime and creating alternatives, especially through a linkage with food sovereignty. At the same time, agroecology has been recently adopted by some actors who also promote conventional agriculture. Agroecology can play different roles—either conforming to the dominant regime, or else helping to transform it—contingent on specific empowerment strategies. Tensions between “conform versus transform” roles can be identified in European agroecological research, especially in three areas: farm-level agroecosystems development; participatory plant breeding; and short food-supply chains remunerating agroecological methods. To play a transformative role, collaborative strategies need to go beyond the linear stereotype whereby scientists “transfer” technology or farmers “apply” scientific research results. To the extent that farmer–scientist alliances co-create and exchange knowledge, such gains can transform the research system.","Transformative learning,Social movement,Scientific method,Food sovereignty,Empowerment,Economics,Agronomy,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Agriculture,Typology,Technological transitions,System innovation,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Structuralism,Sociotechnical system,Sociology,Sustainability,Sociology,Social change,Sustainable development,Rural sociology,Politics,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Politics,Point of departure,Neoliberalism,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Food systems,Social movement,Peasant,Grassroots,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization","Les Levidow,Michel Pimbert,Gaëtan Vanloqueren,FW Frank Geels,JW Johan Schot,Bill Davies,David Baulcombe,Ian Crute,Jim Dunwell,Mike Gale,Frank W.

785,From Population Viability Analysis to Coviability of Farmland Biodiversity and Agriculture,2014-01-01,Conservation Biology,10.1111/COBI.12184,"Substantial declines in farmland biodiversity have been reported in Europe for several decades. Agricultural changes have been identified as a main driver of these declines. Although different agrienvironmental schemes have been implemented, their positive effect on biodiversity is relatively unknown. This raises the question as to how to reconcile farming production and biodiversity conservation to operationalize a sustainable and multifunctional agriculture. We devised a bioeconomic model and conducted an analysis based on coviability of farmland biodiversity and agriculture. The coviability approach extended population viability analyses by including bioeconomic risk. Our model coupled stochastic dynamics of both biodiversity and farming land-uses selected at the microlevel with public policies at the macrolevel on the basis of financial incentives (taxes or subsidies) for land uses. The coviability approach made it possible for us to evaluate bioeconomic risks of these public incentives through the probability of satisfying a mix of biodiversity and economic constraints over time. We calibrated the model and applied it to a community of 34 common birds in metropolitan France at the small agricultural regions scale. We identified different public policies and scenarios with tolerable (0-0%) agroecological risk and modeled their outcomes up to 2050. Budgetary, economic, and ecological (based on Farmland Bird Index) constraints were essential to understanding the set of viable public policies. Our results suggest that some combinations of taxes on cereals and subsidies on grasslands could be relevant to develop a multifunctional agriculture. Moreover, the flexibility and multicriteria viewpoint underlying the coviability approach may help in the implementation of adaptive management.","Subsidy,Population,Land use,Environmental resource management,Ecology,Biology,Bioeconomics,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural biodiversity,Adaptive management,Trophic level,Trophic cascade,Pelagic zone,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat,Survey methodology,Internal consistency,Economics,Wildlife,Geography,Agricultural policy,Wader,Species richness,Species diversity,Vital rates,Sampling (statistics),Population viability analysis,Species richness,Species diversity,Landscape ecology,State of nature,Spite,Sampling (statistics),Set-aside,Population decline,Population,Wildlife conservation,Wildlife,Protected area","Lauriane Mouysset,Luc Doyen,Frédéric Jiguet,Daniel Pauly,Villy Christensen,Johanne Dalsgaard,Rainer Froese,Francisco Torres,Tim G.

A review,2014-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-014-0216-7,"Chemical control has highly expanded over the last 30 years in sub-Saharan Africa to reduce bio-aggressors on all crops. Pest management of fruits and vegetables by small farmers in sub-Saharan Africa have developed anarchically in a fuzzy regulation framework. Pesticide toxicity and excessive application are often criticized both by farmers and consumers. Here, we review pesticide management in sub-Saharan Africa over the past 30 years. We then propose options to improve and reduce pesticide application, in order to decrease environmental and human hazards. The major points are as follows: (1) global changes in sub-Saharan Africa such as urbanization modify farmer practices and crop losses. (2) Pesticides are more and more used by small farmers in an unsustainable way. (3) The risk of pesticide application for human health and environment is poorly known. (4) We propose options to reduce pesticide application based upon integrated pest management (IPM) and agroecology.

787,Crop diversification as a smallholder livelihood strategy within semi-arid agricultural systems near Mount Kenya,2014-01-01,Land Use Policy,10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2014.10.012,"Crop diversification is one strategy that smallholder farmers may employ to reduce their vulnerability in the face of global environmental change. Diversification not only expands the number of potential crop types for market, it also improves agroecosystem functioning by building redundancy into the agricultural system and allowing for innovation in areas exhibiting impacts of climate variability. While the driving forces behind and impacts of crop diversification have been extensively investigated, there are particular issues for the prospects of crop diversification to reduce household vulnerability within semi-arid agricultural systems. The decision to diversify crops is a particularly challenging one for farmers in semi-arid systems. Semi-arid systems can exhibit greater variability in annual precipitation in areas that are marginal for agricultural production. Changes to the timing of the growing season (onset of rains) and mid-season dry periods in particular pose significant challenges to farmers in semi-arid ecosystems. This paper examines the spatial diversification of crop types across an upland-lowland gradient on Mount Kenya's northwestern slopes. We perform regression analyses using household-level survey data collected during the summer of 2012 to investigate the factors contributing to varying levels of crop diversification and implications for crop production in a semi-arid irrigated agricultural system. We hypothesize that the study area locations at higher elevations will be able to grow a greater variety of crops due to climate suitability. Our analysis demonstrates that household-level income, field size, exposure to agricultural extension officers, and suitability of environmental conditions are related to the likelihood of smallholder crop diversification. More favorable growing conditions appear to outweigh limitations posed by inaccessibility and financial constraints, which has implications for adaptation to climate change in semi-arid ecosystems. We discuss the results in the context of challenges posed by global environmental change.","Economics,Diversification (marketing strategy),Crop diversity,Climate change,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural extension,Agricultural diversification,Vulnerability,Sustainability,Latin Americans,Weather station,Spatial variability,Spatial ecology,Total human ecosystem,Species diversity,Geography,Sustainability,Soil indicators,Sociology,Variables,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Sociology,Sociological theory of diffusion,Product innovation,Species richness,Population density,Ecosystem process,Psychological resilience,Monoculture,Incentive,Staple food,Risk management,Political economy of climate change,Variable cost,Technological change,Small farm","Paul F.

However, the beneficial effects of long-term feeding have been the subject of debate. We therefore studied the effects of lifelong consumption of this diet in mice. Complete metabolic analyses were performed after 8 and 80 weeks on the diet. In addition we performed a serum metabolomic analysis and examined hepatic gene expression. Lifelong consumption of KD had no effect on morbidity or mortality (KD vs. Chow, 676 vs. 630 days) despite hepatic steatosis and inflammation in KD mice. The KD fed mice lost weight initially as previously reported (Kennnedy et al., 2007) and remained lighter and had less fat mass; KD consuming mice had higher levels of energy expenditure, improved glucose homeostasis and higher circulating levels of β-hydroxybutyrate and triglycerides than chow-fed controls. Hepatic expression of the critical metabolic regulators including fibroblast growth factor 21 were also higher in KD-fed mice while expression levels of lipogenic enzymes such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 was reduced. Metabolomic analysis revealed compensatory changes in amino acid metabolism, primarily involving down-regulation of catabolic processes, demonstrating that mice eating KD can shift amino acid metabolism to conserve amino acid levels. Long-term KD feeding caused profound and persistent metabolic changes, the majority of which are seen as health promoting, and had no adverse effects on survival in mice.","Steatosis,Ketogenic diet,Ketogenesis,Internal medicine,Insulin,Ingestion,Glucose homeostasis,FGF21,Endocrinology,Catabolism,Biology,Biochemistry,Valine,Pharmacometabolomics,Metabolite,Weight gain,Internal medicine,Insulin resistance,Ketone bodies,Ketogenic diet,Ketogenesis,Tolerability,Randomized controlled trial,Physical therapy,Sterol esterification,Saturated fatty acid,Phospholipid homeostasis,Weight gain,Protein catabolism,Metabolism,Unfolded protein response,Tunicamycin,Transcription Factor CHOP,Lipid oxidation,Ketosis,Ketogenic diet,Type 2 diabetes,Pancreatic hormone,Metabolic intermediate,Weight loss,Metabolic state,Metabolic effects","Nicholas Douris,Tamar Melman,Jordan M.

790,Organic farming enhances soil microbial abundance and activity-A meta-analysis and meta-regression.,2017-01-01,PLOS ONE,10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0180442,"Population growth and climate change challenge our food and farming systems and provide arguments for an increased intensification of agriculture. A promising option is eco-functional intensification through organic farming, an approach based on using and enhancing internal natural resources and processes to secure and improve agricultural productivity, while minimizing negative environmental impacts. In this concept an active soil microbiota plays an important role for various soil based ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, erosion control and pest and disease regulation. Several studies have reported a positive effect of organic farming on soil health and quality including microbial community traits. However, so far no systematic quantification of whether organic farming systems comprise larger and more active soil microbial communities compared to conventional farming systems was performed on a global scale. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis on current literature to quantify possible differences in key indicators for soil microbial abundance and activity in organic and conventional cropping systems. All together we integrated data from 56 mainly peer-reviewed papers into our analysis, including 149 pairwise comparisons originating from different climatic zones and experimental duration ranging from 3 to more than 100 years. Overall, we found that organic systems had 32% to 84% greater microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, total phospholipid fatty-acids, and dehydrogenase, urease and protease activities than conventional systems. Exclusively the metabolic quotient as an indicator for stresses on microbial communities remained unaffected by the farming systems. Categorical subgroup analysis revealed that crop rotation, the inclusion of legumes in the crop rotation and organic inputs are important farming practices affecting soil microbial community size and activity. Furthermore, we show that differences in microbial size and activity between organic and conventional farming systems vary as a function of land use (arable, orchards, and grassland), plant life cycle (annual and perennial) and climatic zone. In summary, this study shows that overall organic farming enhances total microbial abundance and activity in agricultural soils on a global scale.","Zero Budget Farming,Soil organic matter,Organic farming,No-till farming,Intensive farming,Environmental science,Ecological farming,Crop rotation,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Test statistic,Systematic review,Study heterogeneity,Psychology,Natural language processing,Meta-analysis,World map,Water resources,Regionalisation,Trim and fill,Statistics,Publication bias,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Soil science,Population,Organic farming,Terrestrial ecosystem,Species richness,Soil water,Soil water,Soil respiration,Soil pH,Unit-weighted regression,Statistics,Statistical hypothesis testing,Statistics,Selection bias,Random effects model","Martina Lori,Sarah Symnaczik,Paul Mäder,Gerlinde De Deyn,Andreas Gattinger,Julian P T Higgins,Simon G Thompson,Jonathan J Deeks,Douglas G Altman,Michael Borenstein,Larry V.

791,Intercropping with legume for agroecological cropping systems: Complementarity and facilitation processes and the importance of soil microorganisms. A review,2017-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2017.02.019,"Abstract Intercropping is a powerful way to promote a more diversified plant community in the field, thereby enabling complementary and facilitative relationships. In these systems, legumes are a key functional group, and are highly valued for the agroecological services they provide. This review identifies the different complementarity and facilitation processes in soils in intercropped legume/cereal systems and the key role of soil microorganisms in these processes. The intercropped legumes/cereal systems reduce inter-specific competition by enhancing complementarity/facilitation processes thereby improving the exploitation of resources, which is, in turn, reflected in the increase in plant production corresponding to greater efficiency of the agroecosystem as a whole. Plant production, including above- and belowground biomass, is positively correlated with microbial abundance and diversity. This microbial life is assumed to play a significant role in the availability and transfer of soil nutrients to plants as well as in plant health and soil fertility. Although we are currently unable to identify a reliable and exhaustive pattern of plant-microbe interactions, perhaps simply because no universal relationship exists between plants and microorganisms, reliable scenarios reveal strong trends and define the conditions required for successful intercropping systems and microbial interactions. Given our incomplete knowledge of facilitation processes and belowground interactions, intercropping systems must learn from and apply the experience gained in successful experiments. Intercropping dynamics play a critical role in explaining the establishment of facilitative root interactions and finally suggest perennial plant associations may be more effective than annual ones.","Soil fertility,Rhizosphere,Plant community,Intercropping,Facilitation,Cropping,Complementarity (molecular biology),Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Symbiosis,Root microbiome,Rhizosphere,Terrestrial ecosystem,Species richness,Soil water,Sustainable agriculture,Root microbiome,Rhizosphere,Terrestrial ecosystem,Species richness,Species diversity,Plant breeding,Phosphorus deficiency,Phosphorus,Price equation,Niche differentiation,Natural selection,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Soil type,Soil structure,Soil classification,Plant growth,Plant community,Mainstream","Olivier Duchene,Jean-François Vian,Florian Celette,David Tilman,Kenneth G.

No significant differences were detected between C. juncea and fallow as related to cabbage or radish yields in any of the systems used (single crops and intercropping). Intercropping had no effect on cabbage yield, but significantly reduced radish root yield. However, commercial standard of the harvested radish roots was not affected. An average AEI of 1,59 for the two experimental years was attained, thus indicating the viability of the cabbage-radish intercropping. The system makes possible to afford additional income for a given area cultivated with cabbage, at its conventional single-crop spacing, by including radish as a secondary crop.

795,Social and ecological analysis of commercial integrated crop livestock systems: Current knowledge and remaining uncertainty,2017-01-01,Agricultural Systems,10.1016/J.AGSY.2017.05.003,"Crops and livestock play a synergistic role in global food production and farmer livelihoods. Increasingly, however, crops and livestock are produced in isolation, particularly in farms operating at the commercial scale. It has been suggested that re-integrating crop and livestock systems at the field and farm level could help reduce the pollution associated with modern agricultural production and increase yields. Despite this potential, there has been no systematic review to assess remaining knowledge gaps in both the social and ecological dimensions of integrated crop and livestock systems (ICLS), particularly within commercial agricultural systems. Based on a multi-disciplinary workshop of international experts and additional literature review, we assess the current knowledge and remaining uncertainties about large-scale, commercial ICLS and identify the source of remaining knowledge gaps to establish priorities for future research. We find that much is understood about nutrient flows, soil quality, crop performance, and animal weight gain in commercial ICLS, but there is little knowledge about its spatial extent, animal behavior or welfare in ICLS, or the tradeoffs between biodiversity, pest and disease control, greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, and drought and heat tolerance in ICLS. There is some evidence regarding the economic outcomes in commercial ICLS and supply chain and policy barriers to adoption, but little understanding of broader social outcomes or cultural factors influencing adoption. Many of these knowledge gaps arise from a basic lack of data at both the field and system scales, which undermines both statistical analysis and modeling efforts. Future priorities for the international community of researchers investigating the tradeoffs and scalability of ICLS include: methods standardization to better facilitate international collaborations and comparisons, continued social organization for better data utilization and collaboration, meta-analyses to answer key questions from existing data, the establishment of long term experiments and surveys in key regions, a portal for citizen science, and more engagement with ICLS farmers.","Sustainable agriculture,Supply chain,Livelihood,Food systems,Ecosystem services,Economics,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Tillage,Soil water,Soil science,Sustainable agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Systems simulation,Simulation modelling,Simulation,Small farm,Family farm,Economics,Tillage,Strip-till,Soil science,Subsoil,Soil water,Soil salinity","R.

796,Soil carbon sequestration in tropical agroforestry systems: a feasibility appraisal §,2009-01-01,Environmental Science & Policy,10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2009.01.010,"Abstract Agroforestry is recognized as a strategy for soil carbon sequestration (SCS) under the afforestation/reforestation activities, but our understanding of soil carbon (C) dynamics under agroforestry systems (AFS) is not adequate. Although some SCS estimates are available, many of them lack scientific rigor. Several interrelated and site-specific factors ranging from agroecological conditions to system management practices influence the rate and extent of SCS under AFS, so that generalizations tend to become unrealistic. Furthermore, widely and easily adoptable methodologies are not available for estimating the SCS potential under different conditions. In spite of these, there is an increasing demand for developing “best-bet estimates” based on the current level of knowledge and experience. This document presents an attempt in that direction. The appraisal validates the conjecture that AFS can contribute to SCS, and presents indicative ranges of SCS under different AFS in the major agroecological regions of the tropics. The suggested values range from 5 to 10 kg C ha−1 in about 25 years in extensive tree-intercropping systems of arid and semiarid lands to 100–250 kg C ha−1 in about 10 years in species-intensive multistrata shaded perennial systems and homegardens of humid tropics.","Tropics,Soil carbon,Reforestation,Forest ecology,Economics,Carbon sequestration,Arid,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Afforestation,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Soil fertility,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Vegetation type,Vegetation,Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands,Soil water,Soil science,Soil organic matter,Subsoil,Soil water,Soil chemistry,Tillage,Soil water,Soil science,Water content,Total organic carbon,Soil temperature,Stock (geology),Soil organic matter,Profitability index,Sustainability,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Turnover time,Soil water,Soil organic matter","P.K.

Brazilian smallholders, however, are facing huge challenges to enter and benefit from this growth in a sustainable way. Combining the lens of New Institutional Economics and socio-anthropology, we analyze six experiences of Brazilian smallholders who converted to organics in the 1990s'. Three different food systems are featured in this analysis: an alternative food system, which is strongly interwoven with the Brazilian Agro-ecological movement and two commercial food procurement systems oriented towards domestic and an export markets driven mainly by supermarket chains. The analytical focus was on 1) the governance of these food systems, 2) the constraints farmers are facing within these food systems and, 3) the benefits that they can expect from market inclusion. We highlighted the roles that NGOs, Faith-based organizations and public-related agencies play in supporting the inclusion of smallholders into all three food systems. We confirmed the arguments in support of pursuing the agroecological development based model in Brazil, but underlined that there is a critical lack of support for farmers included in the commercial market-oriented food systems. Such a lack is even more critical as the food systems driven by expanding supermarket chains are characterized by strong asymmetric power relations at the expense of smallholders. Considering the reluctance of NGOs and Faith-based organizations to support these farmers, we call for efforts to be made to provide a policy framework to enable public-related entities to secure sustainable inclusion into these systems and exit strategies for those experiencing exclusion from these highly competitive food systems.","Religious organization,Procurement,New institutional economics,Food systems,Exit strategy,Environmental resource management,Economics,Corporate governance,Agroecology,Agriculture,Transaction cost,Rational choice institutionalism,Path dependence,Sustainability,Statistics,Principles of Organic Agriculture,Social science,Social analysis,Quarter century,Spell,Rapid rise,Poverty,Industrial organization,Business,Agriculture,Sociology,Socioeconomics,Social movement,Humanities,Economy,Economics,Revenue,Organic farming,Organic coffee,Trade fair,Statistics,Per capita,Statistics,Organic systems,Organic management","Julien Blanc,Paul R.

However, how the spatial arrangement of crop fields and other habitats in landscapes impacts arthropods and their functions is poorly known. Synthesising data from 49 studies (1515 landscapes) across Europe, we examined effects of landscape composition (% habitats) and configuration (edge density) on arthropods in fields and their margins, pest control, pollination and yields. Configuration effects interacted with the proportions of crop and non-crop habitats, and species’ dietary, dispersal and overwintering traits led to contrasting responses to landscape variables. Overall, however, in landscapes with high edge density, 70% of pollinator and 44% of natural enemy species reached highest abundances and pollination and pest control improved 1.7- and 1.4-fold respectively. Arable-dominated landscapes with high edge densities achieved high yields. This suggests that enhancing edge density in European agroecosystems can promote functional biodiversity and yield-enhancing ecosystem services.","Sustainable agriculture,Pollination,Habitat,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Biology,Biological dispersal,Biodiversity,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Statistics,Smoothing spline,Restricted maximum likelihood,Statistics,Statistic,Multilevel model,Wetland,Riparian zone,Population,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Greenhouse gas,Food systems,Spatial heterogeneity,Moderation,Landscape epidemiology,Crop yield,Crop,Biology,Terrestrial ecosystem,Sustainable yield,Soil biodiversity,Trait,Plant functional type,Life history theory,Trait,Taxon,Functional space,Species diversity,Predation,Pesticide","Emily A.

799,Permitting Pluralism: The Seal Products Dispute and Why the WTO Should Permit Trade Restrictions Justified by Noninstrumental Moral Values,2011-01-01,Yale Journal of International Law,,"This Article examines the extent to which countries can use animal welfare concerns to justify placing restrictions on international trade, under the law of the World Trade Organization (WTO). We argue that non-instrumental moral and religious concerns should be a legitimate source of trade policy. To make this claim, we examine a current WTO dispute between the European Union (EU), Canada, and Norway. The EU has banned seal products from being sold in the EU, because of animal welfare concerns regarding how the animals are hunted and skinned. Canada and Norway have challenged this regulation at the WTO, arguing that animal welfare is not a legitimate rationale for restricting trade under the law of the WTO. First, we show that animal welfare has long been a motivation for legislation, both in Europe and elsewhere. Second, we demonstrate that the EU measure was taken because of the moral belief that animal welfare should be protected, a belief related both to avoidance of actual suffering of animals and about the appropriate human attitude toward their treatment. Third, we argue that the EU measure does not violate any WTO provisions and, even if it did, it could be justified under the General Exceptions clause (Article XX) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the primary source of WTO law). Finally, we argue that the WTO should not deny countries the ability to regulate for moral reasons. If the WTO were to do this, it would risk imposing a secular, materialist, instrumentally rational worldview on its member states. Instead, the WTO should permit pluralism – competing notions of righteousness. – and allow countries to regulate for moral reasons. The EU’s seal products ban should be upheld by the WTO. The WTO legal framework, moreover, must be able to accommodate and accept that animal welfare measures may have at the same time both a utilitarian or instrumental aspect (improving animal welfare outcomes) as well as an expressive aspect, indicating moral opprobrium at the inhumane treatment of animals.","Sociology,Socioeconomics,Righteousness,Pluralism (political theory),Materialism,Legislation,Law,European union,Commercial policy,Argument,Animal welfare,Trade barrier,Multilateral trade negotiations,Legitimacy","Robert L.

Intensive measures have been taken for crop protection against pests through the widespread use of chemical pesticides in order to reduce the loss of agriculture yield. Although crop protection practices have reduced the overall potential losses of 50 % to actual losses of about 30 %, crop losses due to pests still vary from 14 to 35 % according to the country. Moreover, consequences of this intensive agriculture are now well known with an important increase of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, water pollution and biodiversity loss. Current challenge is thus to design alternative sustainable cropping systems which maintain food production while reducing externalities. Application of ecological principles to agroecosystems has been proposed for that purpose. Nonetheless, it is difficult since crop systems are characterised by frequent and high disturbances, high nutrient input and high pressure of human activities. Here, we review the current knowledge in weed science and functional ecology and propose a conceptual framework to analyse weed community assembly in arable fields. Cropping systems are highly variable in their combination of agricultural techniques. We designed a trait-based approach of functional diversity (1) to establish a comparative description of the environmental gradients created by cropping systems and (2) to characterise the response of weeds to environmental gradients. We categorise the effects of cropping systems on the environment into disturbance and resource gradients. Disturbances induced by actual and previous agricultural practices are split into physical and chemical components, whose regime are defined by disturbance timing and frequency. Resource availability in arable fields is described by the value of effect traits of crops, such as plant height, that are related to their use of resources. Finally, we provide a list of relevant response traits of weeds to each component of the two gradients.","Sustainability,Intensive farming,Functional ecology,Cropping,Crop protection,Biology,Arable land,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Vegetation,Trait,Specific leaf area,Stratification (seeds),Soil seed bank,Seed dormancy,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide,Realized niche width,Niche,Limiting similarity,Vegetation,Trait,Species richness,Vegetation,Terrestrial plant,Plant ecology,Trait,Terminology,Plant traits,Trophic level,Species richness,Global biodiversity,Slow response,Plant ecology,Longevity","Sabrina Gaba,Guillaume Fried,Elena Kazakou,Bruno Chauvel,Marie-Laure Navas,David Tilman,Christian Balzer,Jason Hill,Belinda L.

Exploring an agricultural innovation ecosystems approach for niche design and development in sustainability transitions,2018-01-01,Agricultural Systems,10.1016/J.AGSY.2018.04.007,"Well-designed and supported innovation niches may facilitate transitions towards sustainable agricultural futures, which may follow different approaches and paradigms such as agroecology, local place-based food systems, vertical farming, bioeconomy, urban agriculture, and smart farming or digital farming. In this paper we consider how the existing agricultural innovation systems (AIS) approach might be opened up to better support the creation of innovation niches. We engage with Innovation Ecosystems thinking to consider the ways in which it might enhance efforts to create multi-actor, cross-sectoral innovation niches that are capable of supporting transitions to sustainable agricultural systems across multiple scales. While sharing many similarities with AIS thinking, Innovation Ecosystems thinking has the potential to broaden AIS by: emphasizing the role of power in shaping directionality in innovation platforms or innovation communities that are connected to niches and their interaction with regimes; highlighting the plurality of actors and actants and the integral role of ecological actants in innovation; and offering an umbrella concept through which to cross scalar and paradigmatic or sector boundaries in order to engage with a variety of innovation systems affecting multifunctional agricultural landscapes and systems. To this end, an Agricultural Innovation Ecosystems approach may help design and support development of transboundary, inter-sectoral innovation niches that can realize more collective and integrated innovation in support of sustainability transitions, and help enact mission oriented agricultural innovation policy.","Vertical farming,Urban agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Niche,Industrial organization,Food systems,Economics,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sociology,Social theory,Social science,Technological transitions,Technological innovation system,Technological change,Supply chain,Stakeholder,Knowledge management,Sustainable innovation,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Transformative learning,Sustainable development,Political science,Sustainability,Stakeholder,Panacea (medicine),Terrestrial ecosystem,Sustainable yield,Soil biodiversity,Unintended consequences,Technical progress,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Sustainability,Systems of innovation,Scrutiny,Path dependence","Ashlee Ann E.

802,Supporting food security in the 21st century through resource-conserving increases in agricultural production,2012-01-01,Agricultural and Food Science,10.1186/2048-7010-1-18,"The Green Revolution was accomplished under a set of demographic, economic, climatic and other conditions in the 20th century that have been changing and will surely be different and more difficult in the decades ahead. The suitability and sustainability of any given agricultural technology depends on factors like resource availability and productivity, energy costs, and environmental constraints. The achievements of Green Revolution technologies in the 1960s and 1970s came at a critical time of impending food shortages, and the world’s people would be worse off without them. However, the rate of yield improvement for cereal production has been slowing since the mid-1980s. Looking ahead at the foreseeable circumstances under which 21st century agricultural producers must try to assure food security, there will be need for technologies that are less dependent on resources that are becoming relatively scarcer, like arable land and water, or becoming relatively more costly, like energy and petrochemical-based inputs. This paper considers agroecologically-based innovations that reduce farmers’ dependence on external inputs, relying more on endogenous processes and existing potentials in plants and soil systems. Such resource-conserving production represents a different approach to meeting food security goals. While these innovations are not yet fully understood and are still being researched, there are good agronomic reasons to account for their effectiveness, and scientific validations are accumulating. Enough successes have been recorded from making changes in the management of plants, soil, water and nutrients that more attention from researchers, policy-makers and practitioners is warranted, especially given the need to adapt to, and to mitigate the effects of, climate change. The same agroecological concepts and management methods that are enhancing factor productivity in rice production are giving similar results with other crops such as wheat, finger millet, sugarcane, mustard, and tef. Genetic potentials are the starting point for any and all agricultural production, and current efforts to improve food security and nutrition through plant breeding efforts should continue. However, future research and production strategies could beneficially seek to capitalize on biological processes and potentials existing within crops and in their supporting soil systems, rather than focusing so predominantly on making modifications in genetic factors. Scientific advances in the domains of microbiology, soil ecology and epigenetics could foreseeably assist farmers in meeting production and income goals with resource-economizing methods. It remains to be seen to what extent agroecologically-informed methods can help farmers meet expected agricultural production requirements to ensure global food security, but this direction deserves more attention and support.","Sustainability,Green Revolution,Food security,Economics,Botany,Arable land,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural machinery,Systems biology,Microbiome,Metagenomics,System of Rice Intensification,Resource poor,Irrigation,Business,Agricultural economics,Agricultural development,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Soil organic matter,Natural resource economics,Land degradation,Food systems,Productivity,Green Revolution,Food security,System of Rice Intensification,Soil fertility,Oryza sativa,Rhizosphere,Operational framework,Microorganism,South asia,Geography,Food supply,Symbiosis,Siderophore,Rhizosphere","Norman Uphoff,Peter J.

804,Impact of Agroecological Infrastructures on the Dynamics of Dysaphis plantaginea (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and Its Natural Enemies in Apple Orchards in Northwestern France,2017-01-01,Environmental Entomology,10.1093/EE/NVX054,": Apple orchard production is facing new environmental and societal challenges, resulting, in particular, in strong pressure to reduce pesticide use. Cider-apple production, for which the perfect visual aspect of fruits is not a marketability imperative, offers good opportunities to study production systems that are developing new agronomic strategies, which could be subsequently extended to all apple-production types. Agroecological infrastructures play an important role in providing shelter, food resources, or reproduction habitats to many arthropods. Consequently, setting-up agroecological infrastructures in the vicinity of or within orchards could increase natural enemy presence and thus improve the biological control of pests. In this study, we focused on Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini), one of the major pests in apple orchards in Europe, which causes important economic production losses. During two years (2014 and 2015), we monitored the population dynamics of D. plantaginea, its natural enemies, and mutualistic ants in commercial production cider-apple orchards. The influences of the cider-apple cultivar, insecticide use, and distance to agroecological infrastructures (hedgerows and flower strips) were assessed. Our results suggest that flower strips favor an increase in natural enemy abundance in the vicinity of the orchards and could thus play an important role in the production system by improving the biological control of D. plantaginea.","Population,Orchard,Hemiptera,Habitat,Cultivar,Botany,Biology,Biological pest control,Aphididae,Agronomy,Agroecology,Statistics,Smoothing spline,Restricted maximum likelihood,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation,Land use,Intensive farming,Integrated farming,Wildlife,Geography,Agricultural policy,Pesticide,Pest control,Integrated pest management,Trophic level,Predation,Population,Species richness,Predation,Niche,Water pollution,Water Framework Directive,Pollution,Pest control,PEST analysis,Horticulture","Laurence Albert,Pierre Franck,Yann Gilles,Manuel Plantegenest,Douglas Bates,Martin Mächler,Benjamin M.

805,Introducing urban food forestry: a multifunctional approach to increase food security and provide ecosystem services,2013-01-01,Landscape Ecology,10.1007/S10980-013-9903-Z,"We examine the potential role of perennial woody food-producing species (“food trees”) in cities in the context of urban sustainable development and propose a multifunctional approach that combines elements of urban agriculture, urban forestry, and agroforestry into what we call “urban food forestry” (UFF). We used four approaches at different scales to gauge the potential of UFF to enhance urban sustainability and contribute to food security in the context of urbanization and climate change. First, we identified 37 current initiatives based around urban food trees, and analyzed their activities in three categories: planting, mapping, and harvesting, finding that the majority (73 %) only performed one activity, and only 8 % performed all three. Second, we analyzed 30 urban forestry master plans, finding that only 13 % included human food security among their objectives, while 77 % included habitat for wildlife. Third, we used Burlington, Vermont as a case study to quantify the potential fruit yield of publicly accessible open space if planted with Malus domestica (the common apple) under nine different planting and yield scenarios. We found that 108 % of the daily recommended minimum intake of fruit for the entire city’s population could be met under the most ambitious planting scenario, with substantial potential to contribute to food security even under more modest scenarios. Finally, we developed a Climate–Food–Species Matrix of potential food trees appropriate for temperate urban environments as a decision-making tool. We identified a total of 70 species, 30 of which we deemed “highly suitable” for urban food forestry based on their cold hardiness, drought tolerance, and edibility. We conclude that substantial untapped potential exists for urban food forestry to contribute to urban sustainability via increased food security and landscape multifunctionality.","Urbanization,Urban forestry,Urban agriculture,Population,Forestry,Food systems,Food security,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Waste disposal,Urbanization,Urban planning,Socioeconomic status,Refined grains,Population,Valuation (finance),Total economic value,Natural resource management,Sustainability science,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Strengths and weaknesses,Natural resource economics,Greenhouse effect,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Natural capital,Urban resilience,Urban planning,Sustainability science,Ripening,Quercetin,Phytochemical,Urban economics,Natural capital,Global hectare","Kyle H.

Despite the rubric’s newfound importance, the conceptual underpinnings of CSA are often left unclear. Focusing on the World Bank’s framework, this paper critically interrogates the principles and concepts that underpin CSA. It argues that while CSA provides greater policy space for more holistic approaches to agriculture, it nonetheless operates within an apolitical framework that is narrowly focused on technical fixes at the level of production. This depoliticised approach to the global food system tends to validate existing policy agendas and minimise questions concerning power, inequality and access. By highlighting four strong tensions that permeate the CSA framework, the paper extols the need to greatly widen the scope of debate.

However, these need not be the only routes through which it can contribute to rural development. Results from an Austrian case study indicate that farmers also view organic farming as a way to disengage from commoditisation through a reorganization of on-farm resources. This allows farmers to move beyond the sole focus on production of raw materials for the food industry and undertake a wider variety of on-and off-farm activities. Conversion to organic farming could thus be a way of overcoming the shortcomings of the agricultural modernisation model, and implementing the rural development model proposed by the Wageningen School.","Sociology,Organic farming,Natural resource economics,Mixed farming,Food industry,Food chain,Environmentally friendly,Environmental resource management,Ecological farming,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Social science,Short food supply chains,Rural development,Sociology,Social science,Rural sociology,Typology,Three level,Supply chain,Western europe,Sociology,Social science,Sociology,Rural sociology,Organic farming,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,The Symbolic,Symbolic interactionism,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Social science,Organic production,Social science,Social phenomenon,Social organization","Ika Darnhofer,Paul Maeder,Henk Renting,Terry K Marsden,Jo Banks,Jan Douwe Van Der Ploeg,Henk Renting,Gianluca Brunori,Karlheinz Knickel,Joe Mannion,Terry Marsden,Jo Banks,Gillian Bristow,David Goodman,Susanne Padel,Dan Rigby,D.

Our econometric analysis identifies the factors that explain farmer demand for hybrid seed, and the age of hybrids they grow, considering hybrid seed ownership. Male-headed households with more education, more assets, and more land plant more hybrid seed. Scale of seed demand per farm is differentiated by agroecology. We find a strong farmer response to the seed-to-grain price ratio, which we interpret as evidence of a commercial orientation even on household farms. However, despite the dramatic increase in the number of hybrids sold and the breadth of seed suppliers as seed markets liberalize, an older hybrid still dominates national demand.","Price ratio,Hybrid seed,Hybrid,Economics,Econometric analysis,Agroecology,Agricultural economics,Sampling (statistics),Population,Panel data,Random coefficient model,Profit (economics),Economics,Statistics,Pooling,Economics,Revenue,Public policy,Microeconomics,Soil fertility,Food security,Field research,Rural development,Innovation adoption,Germplasm,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Public debate,Zea mays,Software deployment,Limiting,Open pollination,Household survey,Grain yield,Tariff,Productivity,Market system","Melinda Smale,John Olwande,Jeffrey M Wooldridge,Tavneet Suri,Yair Mundlak,Singh, Inderjit Squire, Lyn Strauss, John,Derek Byerlee,Carl K.

Dryland agriculture in these discussions has often been treated as a homogenous farming system; however, this was in fact a dynamic system with distinct agroecological zones where specific mixes of crops were grown using different farming methods. We examine this variability by using historical depictions and ground surveys to estimate the extent of an agroecological zone represented by breadfruit plantations within Kona, Hawai'i Island. We estimate that the plantations produced 21,200–58,400 mt/yr of breadfruit on 3100–5900 ha with a likely canopy cover within the plantations of 38–73%. Our models suggest that yields per area in the plantation ranged from 1.96 to 3.61 dry mt/ha. Given the yield and labor requirements, breadfruit could have produced a caloric surplus for 15 people in contrast to 3.6 people under assumed requirements of sweet potato. This high surplus would have been vital for socio-political developments centered in the region, and highlights the importance of assessing variability of dryland field systems in discussion of their role in historical trajectories.","Spatial extent,Social impact,Geology,Ecosystem,Dryland farming,Crop,Canopy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Terrain,Spatial ecology,Precipitation,Wetland,Tropics,Soil fertility,Wetland,Tonne,Soil fertility,Food security,Biotechnology,Biology,Soil fertility,Precipitation,Fertility,Volcano,Population density,Lava,Restructuring,Population growth,Population,Soil properties,Ipomoea,Field system,Sustainability,Population growth,Population,Politics,Political history,Government","Noa Lincoln,Thegn Ladefoged,Thomas W.

It is usually assumed that organic farms have both larger and higher quality areas of semi-natural habitats, although this assumption has not been unequivocally tested. 2 Here we test the hypothesis that in comparison to conventional farms, organic farms have larger areas of semi-natural and boundary vegetation, and organic farms support higher levels of plant abundance, richness and diversity within cropped and semi-natural areas. 3 Our study compared whole-farms: 10 organic farms were paired with 10 conventional farms in a complex landscape in the south-west of England. On average, organic farms were 7·3 years post conversion. Plant abundance, species richness and diversity were measured in all crop and non-crop landscape elements on each farm. 4 Organic farms had greater total areas of semi-natural habitat (woodland, field margins and hedgerows combined). Woodland area on it's own was also significantly greater. Organic farms had more continuous blocks of woodland (with simpler perimeters than similarly sized patches on conventional farms), whereas woodland on conventional farms often consisted of more linear patches. 5 Semi-natural habitats on organic farms did not have higher plant abundance, richness or diversity than their conventional counterparts. The only landscape element that showed a significant increase in plant abundance, richness or diversity was arable fields. 6 Synthesis and applications. Even within a complex agricultural landscape differences do exist between organic and conventional farms, these differences being larger areas of semi-natural habitats on organic farms. However, with the exception of arable fields, no habitats on organic farms were yet of a better quality than their conventional counterparts in terms of plant abundance and diversity. Conventional farmers may be able to achieve an increase in plant diversity within arable fields by adopting some organic management practices at the field scale (e.g. exclusion of synthetic herbicides), and whole-farm conversion to organic practice might not be required. However, further work is needed to determine any biodiversity benefits of larger areas of semi-natural habitat on conventional farmland.","Woodland,Species richness,Spatial heterogeneity,Organic farming,Intensive farming,Ecology,Biology,Biodiversity,Arable land,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Wildlife conservation,Land management,Habitat,Sustainability,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Species richness,Population density,Organic farming,Pollinator decline,Pollination,Peponapis pruinosa,Land use,Intensive farming,Integrated farming,Pollination,Landscape ecology,Habitat,Woodland,Ruderal species,Plant community,Taxonomic rank,Species richness,Organic farming","R.

819,Effects of changes in permit-to-purchase handgun laws in Connecticut and Missouri on suicide rates.,2015-01-01,Preventive Medicine,10.1016/J.YPMED.2015.07.013,"In 2013, more than 40,000 individuals died from suicide in the United States. Restricting access to lethal means has the potential to prevent suicide, as suicidal thoughts are often transient. Permit-to-Purchase (PTP) laws for handguns could potentially reduce suicides by making it more difficult for persons at risk of suicide to purchase a handgun. We used a quasi-experimental research design with annual, state-level suicide data to evaluate changes to PTP laws in Connecticut and Missouri. Data were analyzed for 1981-2012. We used synthetic control modeling as the primary method to estimate policy effects. This methodology provided better prediction of pre-PTP-law-change trends in the two states with PTP law changes than econometric models and are thus likely to provide more accurate estimates of policy effects. The synthetic control model estimated a 15.4% reduction in firearm suicide rates associated with Connecticut's PTP law. Missouri's PTP law repeal was associated with a 16.1% increase in firearm suicide rates. Evidence that PTP laws were associated with non-firearm suicide rates was mixed in Connecticut and negative in Missouri. The findings are consistent with prior research linking firearm availability to increased risk of suicide and lower suicide risks to PTP handgun laws.

821,"Comparing conventional and organic agriculture in Karnataka, India: Where and when can organic farming be sustainable?",2014-01-01,Land Use Policy,10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2012.01.006,"Karnataka is one of the south-western Indian states where agrarian distress as a major problem. Crop yields have been stagnant in the last decade, and coupled with increased input costs, this has led to reduced incomes and debts. There is an urgent need to study options to improve the sustainability of farming systems in Karnataka. One adopted strategy to stabilize agriculture in the state is organic farming, which is less dependent on external inputs. In this paper, we assess the sustainability of conventional and organic farming practices using the model TechnoGIN. TechnoGIN calculates inputs and outputs of farming practices, allowing assessment of its impacts on economic and environmental indicators. Data on inputs and yields have been collected in two districts in 2009 from farms with conventional and organic cultivation at the same time. Additional data were collected from literature and experts. Next, the current situation was assessed and projections were made towards 2015 for two scenarios per village, using either conventional or organic practices. Modeling results show that for the study site situated in a dry region, Chitradurga, profits with organic farming are higher than in conventional farming, except for rotations that include onion. Input costs are lower resulting in lower financial risks with organic farming. Nutrient balances in organic agriculture were however found to be negative for all crop rotations indicating imbalanced supply of nutrients. This suggests it may not be possible to sustain current yields in the long term with current nutrient applications. In the second site situated in a transition zone with intensive cultivation of commercial crops, Mysore, yields and profits are similar in organic farming compared to those under conventional practice, except for commercial crops like cotton and coconut where the profits are lower. The debt risk in case of crop failure appears to be practically similar for both types of farming practices in Mysore. Nutrient balances are generally positive, indicating that NPK supplies are not the main yield limiting factor. It is concluded that organic farming can be a sustainable farming practice in Karnataka depending on regional conditions and the crops cultivated. Policies stimulating organic farming should therefore consider the regional differences and farmer's preferences.","Zero Budget Farming,Organic farming,Natural farming,Mixed farming,Integrated farming,Extensive farming,Environmental protection,Environmental engineering,Economics,Ecological farming,Agroecology,Agricultural science,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource,Species richness,Population density,Organic farming,Sustainable development,Resource management,Natural resource management,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Sustainability,Self reliance,Subtropics,Phosphorus,Oryza sativa,Toxicology,Pesticide toxicity,Pesticide residue,Soil health,Soil functions,Soil fertility,Yield gap,Sustainability,Land use,Water resources,Sustainability,Soil management","Sheetal Patil,Pytrik Reidsma,Pratik Shah,Seema Purushothaman,Joost Wolf,David Tilman,Kenneth G.

It specifically examines Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF), a grassroots peasant agroecology movement in Karnataka, India. ZBNF ends reliance on purchased inputs and loans for farming, positioning itself as a solution to extreme indebtedness and suicides among Indian farmers. The ZBNF movement has achieved massive scale not only because of effective farming practices, but because of a social movement dynamic – motivating members through discourse, mobilizing resources from allies, self-organized pedagogical activities, charismatic and local leadership, and generating a spirit of volunteerism among its members.

823,Large-scale bioenergy production from soybeans and switchgrass in Argentina: Part B. Environmental and socio-economic impacts on a regional level,2009-01-01,Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews,10.1016/J.RSER.2009.03.012,"The feasibility of deploying a socio-economic and environmental impact analysis for large-scale bioenergy production on a regional level is analyzed, based on a set of defined criteria and indicators. The analysis is done for La Pampa province in Argentina. The case study results in conclusions in how far the criteria can be verified ex ante based on available methodologies and data sources. The impacts are analyzed for two bioenergy chains (soybeans and switchgrass) for a set of defined land use scenarios. The carbon stock change for switchgrass ranges from 0.2 to 1.2Â tonÂ C/ha/year and for soybean from -1.2 to 0Â tonÂ C/ha/year, depending on the scenario. The GHG emission reduction ranges from 88% to 133% for the switchgrass bioenergy chain (replacing coal or natural gas) and from 16% to 94% for the soybean bioenergy chain (replacing fossil fuel) for various lifetime periods. The annual soil loss, compared to the reference land use system is 2-10Â ton/ha for the soybean bioenergy chain and 1-2Â ton/ha for the switchgrass bioenergy chain. In total, nine sustainability principles are analyzed. In the case of switchgrass, most environmental benefits can be achieved when produced on suitable land of abandoned cropland. Soybean production for bioenergy shows a good overall sustainability performance if produced on abandoned cropland. The production of switchgrass on degraded grassland shows socio-economic and environmental benefits, which is not the case for soybean production. The production of bioenergy production on non-degraded grassland is not preferred. It is concluded that the scenario approach enables understanding of the complexity of the bioenergy chain and the underlying factors influencing the sustainability principles. It is difficult to give ex ante a final conclusion whether a bioenergy chain is sustainable or not as this depends not only on the previous land use system but also on other factors as the selection of the bioenergy crop, the suitable agroecological zone and the agricultural management system applied. The results also imply that it is possible to steer for a large part the sustainability performance of a bioenergy chain during project development and implementation. Land use planning plays a key role in this process.","Waste management,Sustainability,Panicum virgatum,Land-use planning,Land use,Greenhouse gas,Engineering,Biomass,Bioenergy,Agroecology,Second-generation biofuels,Low-carbon fuel standard,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Sustainable biofuel,Renewable fuels,Low-carbon fuel standard,Powertrain,Mechanical drive,Market potential,Panicum virgatum,Global warming,Fossil fuel,World Energy Outlook,Engineering,Electrical engineering,Phalaris arundinacea,Perennial plant,Panicum virgatum,Sustainability,Stakeholder,Legislation,Renewable resource,Renewable energy,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Resource management,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource economics","J. van Dam,A.P.C.

824,A novel permit scheme for managing parking competition and bottleneck congestion,2014-01-01,Transportation Research Part C-emerging Technologies,10.1016/J.TRC.2014.04.005,"Morning commuters may have to depart from home earlier to secure a parking space when parking supply in the city center is insufficient. Recent studies show that parking reservations can reduce highway congestion and deadweight loss of parking competition simultaneously. This study develops a novel tradable parking permit scheme to realize or implement parking reservations when commuters are either homogeneous or heterogeneous in their values of time. It is found that an expirable parking permit scheme with an infinite number of steps, i.e., the ideal-scheme, is superior to a time-varying pricing scheme in the sense that designing a permit scheme does not require commuters’ value of time information and the performance of the scheme is robust to the variation of commuters’ value of time. Although it is impractical to implement the ideal-scheme with an infinite number of steps, the efficiency loss of a permit scheme with finite steps can be bounded in both cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous commuters. Moreover, considering the permit scheme may lead to an undesirable benefit distribution among commuters, we propose an equal cost-reduction distribution of parking permits where auto commuters with higher value of time will receive fewer permits.","Value of time,Parking space,Parking guidance and information,Mathematical optimization,Infinite number,Homogeneous,Engineering,Deadweight loss,Bounded function,Bottleneck,Traffic flow,Traffic equilibrium,Traffic congestion,Urban economics,Transport engineering,Traffic congestion,Monopolistic competition,Microeconomics,Industrial organization,Transport engineering,Toll road,Toll,Transport engineering,Traffic congestion,Social cost,Value of time,Traffic congestion,Queue,Transport engineering,Traffic congestion,Toll,Vehicle Information and Communication System,Transport engineering,Traffic wave,Transport engineering,Traffic equilibrium,Traffic congestion,Trip generation,Mode choice,Microeconomics","Wei Liu,Hai Yang,Yafeng Yin,Fangni Zhang,Hai Yang,Xiaolei Wang,Richard Arnott,John Rowse,Simon P.

We introduce four archetypes of social-ecological system states corresponding to win–win (e.g., agroecology), win–lose (e.g., intensive agriculture), lose–win (e.g., fortress conservation), and lose–lose (e.g., degraded landscapes) outcomes for food security and biodiversity conservation. Each archetype is shaped by characteristic external drivers, exhibits characteristic internal social-ecological features, and has characteristic feedbacks that maintain it. This framework shifts the emphasis from focusing on production only to considering social-ecological dynamics, and enables comparison among landscapes. Moreover, examining drivers and feedbacks facilitates the analysis of possible transitions between system states (e.g., from a lose–lose outcome to a more preferred outcome).","Nexus (standard),Intensive farming,Food security,Environmental resource management,Ecology,Conceptual framework,Cognitive reframing,Biology,Biodiversity,Archetype,Agroecology,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Sustainable development,Poverty,Food security,Summit,Population,Nationality,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Rural poverty,Urbanization,Sustainability,Public health,Soil water,Soil pH,Soil classification,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Yield gap,Sustainability,Population growth,Water grabbing,Rural area,Land use,Waste management,Food waste,Business","Jörn Fischer,David James Abson,Arvid Olof Daniel Bergsten,Neil French Collier,Ine Dorresteijn,Jan Hanspach,Kristoffer Hylander,Jannik Schultner,Feyera Senbeta,David Tilman,Christian Balzer,Jason Hill,Belinda L.

826,Farm-Level Agricultural Biodiversity in the Peruvian Andes Is Associated with Greater Odds of Women Achieving a Minimally Diverse and Micronutrient Adequate Diet.,2018-01-01,Journal of Nutrition,10.1093/JN/NXY166,"Background: The extent to and mechanisms by which agricultural biodiversity may influence diet diversity and quality among women are not well understood. Objectives: We aimed to 1) determine the association of farm-level agricultural biodiversity with diet diversity and quality among women of reproductive age in Peru and 2) determine the extent to which farm market orientation mediates or moderates this association. Methods: We surveyed 600 households with the use of stratified random sampling across 3 study landscapes in the Peruvian Andes with diverse agroecological and market conditions. Diet diversity and quality among women were assessed by using quantitative 24-h dietary recalls with repeat recalls among 100 randomly selected women. We calculated a 10-food group diet diversity score (DDS), the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) indicator, probability of adequacy (PA) of 9 micronutrients by using a measurement-error model approach, and mean PA (MPA; mean of PAs for all nutrients). Agricultural biodiversity was defined as a count of crop species cultivated by the household during the 2016-2017 agricultural season. Results: In regression analyses adjusting for sociodemographic and agricultural characteristics, farm-level agricultural biodiversity was associated with a higher DDS (incidence rate ratio from Poisson regression: 1.03; P  60%: OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.35). Farm market orientation did not consistently moderate these associations, and in path analyses we observed no consistent evidence of mediation of these associations by farm market orientation. Conclusions: Farm-level agricultural biodiversity was associated with moderately more diverse and more micronutrient-adequate diets among Peruvian women. This association was consistent across farms with varying levels of market orientation, although agricultural biodiversity likely contributed to diets principally through subsistence consumption.","Subsistence agriculture,Stratified sampling,Socioeconomics,Poisson regression,Micronutrient,Biology,Biodiversity,Biochemistry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural biodiversity,Surgery,Social protection,Psychological intervention,Wealth index,Psychology,Demographic economics,Vitamin,Status assessment,Riboflavin,Species richness,Per capita,Geography,Socioeconomics,Population,Market access,Socioeconomic status,Per capita income,Operationalization,Standard of living,Species richness,Species evenness,Variance function,Statistics,Proper linear model,Underweight,Socioeconomic status,Rural area,Technical skills,Psychological intervention,Poverty","Andrew D.

827,Cover crops to increase soil microbial diversity and mitigate decline in perennial agriculture. A review,2016-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-016-0385-7,"Commercial perennial agriculture is prone to declining productivity due to negative plant-soil feedback. An alternative to costly and environmentally harmful conventional treatment such as soil fumigation could be to manipulate soil microbial diversity through careful selection and management of cover crop mixtures. Although cover crops are already used in these systems for other reasons, their capacity to influence soil biota is unexploited. Here, we examine the role of plant diversity and identity on plant-soil feedbacks in the context of perennial agriculture. We identify key microorganisms involved in these feedbacks and explore plant-based strategies for mitigating decline of perennial crop plants. We conclude that (1) increasing plant diversity increases soil microbial diversity, minimizing the proliferation of soil-borne pathogens; (2) populations of beneficial microbes can be increased by increasing plant functional group richness, e.g., legumes, C4 grasses, C3 grasses, and non-leguminous forbs; (3) brassicas suppress fungal pathogens and promote disease-suppressive bacteria; (4) native plants may further promote beneficial soil microbiota; and (5) frequent tillage, herbicide use, and copper fungicides can harm populations of beneficial microbes and, in some cases, contribute to greater crop decline. Non-crop vegetation management is a viable and cost-effective means of minimizing crop decline in perennial monocultures but is in need of more direct experimental investigation in perennial agroecosystems.","Tillage,Soil biology,Perennial plant,No-till farming,Crop,Cover crop,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Soil pH,Soil microbiology,Microbial ecology,Trichoderma harzianum,Trichoderma,Systemic acquired resistance,Terrestrial ecosystem,Species richness,Soil water,Transmission (mechanics),Ecosystem services,Ecosystem,Terrestrial ecosystem,Species richness,Species diversity,Soil microbiology,Pseudomonas protegens,Pseudomonas chlororaphis,Terrestrial ecosystem,Spatial ecology,Soil biodiversity,Symbiosis,Strigolactone,Spore,Substrate (chemistry),Soil organic matter,Nitrogen,Soil texture,Soil test,Soil pH","Eric Vukicevich,Tom Lowery,Pat Bowen,José Ramon Úrbez-Torres,Noah Fierer,Robert B.

Soil fertility indicators that correlate with the intensification of dryland agriculture in pre-contact Hawai'i have been mapped across the Hawaiian archipelago. We investigated these soil fertility indicators and agricultural development in the unique environment of Kona, Hawai'i, the largest, culturally most significant, and geologically youngest of the dryland field systems in Hawai'i. Agriculture was intensified systematically on substrates ≥4,000 years old with appropriate climate and fertility in Kona, in keeping with archipelago-wide analyses. In comparison with other dryland agricultural systems in Hawaii, we found that soil fertility indicators used to predict pre-European agricultural intensification are shifted towards lower rainfall on the younger geological substrates of Kona. For example, base saturation reached low levels (<30%) at ∼1200 mm/yr rainfall on 1,200 year old substrate and at ∼1400 mm/yr on 7,500 year old substrate in Kona, versus ∼1800 mm/yr on 150,000 year old substrate on Kohala Volcano. We suggest that this difference reflects a kinetic, rather than an irreversible, limitation to soil fertility in Kona, and we discuss how this difference could have influenced opportunities for agricultural intensification and the distribution of agroecological zones.","Soil fertility,Precipitation,Fertility,Ecology,Biology,Archipelago,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural intensification,Agricultural development,Terrain,Spatial ecology,Precipitation,Soil water,Soil science,Redox,Weathering,Substrate (chemistry),Soil water,Wetland,Tropics,Soil fertility,Wetland,Tonne,Soil fertility,Spatial extent,Social impact,Geology,Volcano,Population density,Lava,Weathering,Tectonic uplift,Soil horizon,Soil properties,Ipomoea,Field system,Weathering,Soil water,Soil fertility","Noa Lincoln,Oliver Chadwick,Peter Vitousek,Thomas W.

829,How Agricultural Intensification Affects Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services,2015-01-01,Advances in Ecological Research,10.1016/BS.AECR.2016.08.005,"As the world's population continues to grow, the demand for food, fodder, fibre and bioenergy will increase. In Europe, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has driven the intensification of agriculture, promoting the simplification and specialization of agroecosystems through the decline in landscape heterogeneity, the increased use of chemicals per unit area, and the abandonment of less fertile areas. In combination, these processes have eroded the quantity and quality of habitat for many plants and animals, and hence decreased biodiversity and the abundance of species across a hierarchy of trophic levels and spatial scales within Europe. This biodiversity loss has led to profound changes in the functioning of European agroecosystems over the last 50 years. Here, we synthesize the findings from a large-scale pan-European investigation of the combined effects of agricultural intensification on a range of agroecosystem services. These include (1) the persistence of high conservation value species; (2) the level of biological control of agricultural pests and (3) the functional diversity of a number of taxonomic groups, including birds, beetles and arable weeds. The study encompasses a gradient of geography-bioclimate and agricultural intensification that enables the large-scale measurement of ecological impacts of agricultural intensification across European agroecosystems. We provide an overview of the role of the CAP as a driver of agricultural intensification in the European Union, and we demonstrate compelling negative relationships between the application of pesticides and the various components of biodiversity studied on a pan-European scale.","Population,European union,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Common Agricultural Policy,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural biodiversity,Mixed effects,Geography,Applied mathematics,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Habitat fragmentation,Habitat destruction,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat,Structural equation modeling,Statistics,Random effects model,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource","M.

Both counties lie in lower midland (LM) lower humidity to semiarid (LM4), and semiarid (LM5) agroecological zones (AEZ). We assessed food security, dietary diversity, and nutritional status of children and women. Materials and Methods. A total of 277 woman-child pairs aged 15–46 years and 6–36 months respectively, were recruited from farmer households. Food security and dietary diversity were assessed using standard tools. Weight and height, or length in children, were used for computation of nutritional status. Findings. No significant difference (P > 0.05) was observed in food security and dietary diversity score (DDS) between LM4 and LM5. Stunting, wasting, and underweight levels among children in LM4 and LM5 were comparable as were BMI scores among women. However, significant associations (P = 0.023) were found between severe food insecurity and nutritional status of children but not of their caregivers. Stunting was significantly higher in older children (>2 years) and among children whose caregivers were older. Conclusion. Differences in AEZ may not affect dietary diversity and nutritional status of farmer households.

834,"Why are ecological, low-input, multi-resistant wheat cultivars slow to develop commercially? A Belgian agricultural ‘lock-in’ case study",2008-01-01,Ecological Economics,10.1016/J.ECOLECON.2007.10.007,"The use of multi-resistant cultivars allows a significant reduction in fungicide use in low-input cropping systems. However, many major wheat cultivars used in Europe remain sensitive to frequent diseases and require fungicide protection. This paper aims at understanding the factors explaining the low level of adoption of multi-resistant wheat cultivars in Wallonia (Belgium). Cultivar adoption has been an important topic of research, but few analyses have been done in Europe in the past decades. We used a systems approach combining a survey among stakeholders in the food chain and a systematic analysis of the publications of extension services. We identified twelve factors impeding wider adoption of multi-resistant cultivars. These factors explain why current wheat-cropping systems are maintained in a 'pesticide lock-in' situation, an economic concept that could be used more frequently to study agricultural innovations. Considering these intangible 'barriers' to current and forthcoming innovations is a first step towards a more comprehensive policy to promote sustainable agriculture. Similarities between Wallonia and France are discussed and methods of promoting wide use of resistant cultivars are proposed.","Sustainable agriculture,Low input,Integrated pest management,Food chain,Economics,Ecology,Cultivar,Cropping,Agroecology,Agriculture,Technological transitions,Supply and demand,Subsidy,Path dependency,Path dependence,Path creation,Viable system model,Systems thinking,Systems methodology,Technological innovation system,Returns to scale,Market penetration,Monographella,Microdochium,Gibberella zeae,Sociology,Unruh effect,Technological change,Returns to scale,Social psychology,Public relations,Positive economics,Sustainability,Pesticide,Externality,Sustainable agriculture,Host specificity,Disease management","Gaëtan Vanloqueren,Philippe V.

835,Managing Permit Markets to Stabilize Prices,2005-01-01,Environmental and Resource Economics,10.1007/S10640-005-1761-Y,"The political economy of environmental policy favors the use of quantity-based instruments over price-based instruments (e.g., tradable permits over green taxes), at least in the United States. With cost uncertainty, however, there are clear efficiency advantages to prices in cases where the marginal damages of emissions are relatively flat, such as with greenhouse gases. The question arises, therefore, of whether one can design flexible quantity policies that mimic the behavior of price policies, namely stable permit prices and abatement costs. We explore a number of “quantity-plus” policies that replicate the behavior of a price policy through rules that adjust the effective permit cap for unexpectedly low or high costs. They do so without necessitating any monetary exchanges between the government and the regulated firms, which can be a significant political barrier to the use of price instruments.

836,The factors driving evolved herbicide resistance at a national scale,2018-01-01,Nature Ecology and Evolution,10.1038/S41559-018-0470-1,"Repeated use of xenobiotic chemicals has selected for the rapid evolution of resistance, threatening health and food security at a global scale. Strategies for preventing the evolution of resistance include cycling and mixtures of chemicals and diversification of management. We currently lack large-scale studies that evaluate the efficacy of these different strategies for minimizing the evolution of resistance. Here we use a national-scale data set of occurrence of the weed Alopecurus myosuroides (black-grass) in the United Kingdom to address this. Weed densities are correlated with assays of evolved resistance, supporting the hypothesis that resistance is driving weed abundance at a national scale. Resistance was correlated with the frequency of historical herbicide applications, suggesting that evolution of resistance is primarily driven by intensity of exposure to herbicides, but was unrelated directly to other cultural techniques. We find that populations resistant to one herbicide are likely to show resistance to multiple herbicide classes. Finally, we show that the economic costs of evolved resistance are considerable: loss of control through resistance can double the economic costs of weeds. This research highlights the importance of managing threats to food production and healthcare systems using an evolutionarily informed approach in a proactive not reactive manner.","Weed,Food security,Food processing,Economic cost,Diversification (marketing strategy),Biotechnology,Biology,Alopecurus myosuroides,Agroecology,Agriculture,Statistics,Smoothing spline,Restricted maximum likelihood,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide,Weed,Sustainable solutions,Resistance mutation,Surgery,Medicine,Limited access,Weed control,Weed,Propagule,Statistics,Sample size determination,Residual,Population growth,Pesticide resistance,Pesticide,Statistics,Random effects model,Quasi-likelihood","Helen L.

837,The added value of including key microbial traits to determine nitrogen-related ecosystem services in managed grasslands,2017-01-01,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/1365-2664.13010,"Despite playing central roles in nutrient cycles and plant growth, soil microbes are generally neglected in the study of ecosystem services (ES), due to difficulties to assess their diversity and functioning. However, to overcome these hurdles, new conceptual approaches and modern tools now provide a means to assess the role of micro-organisms in the evaluation of ES. In managed grasslands, soil microbes are central in providing nitrogen (N)-related ES such as maintenance of soil fertility and retention of mineral forms of N. Here, we applied state-of-the-art techniques in microbial ecology and plant functional ecology to uncover the intrinsic link between N-related bacterial functional groups, important plant functional traits, environmental factors and three proxies of maintenance of soil fertility and potential for N-leaching across managed grasslands in three regions of Europe. By constructing well-defined structural equation modelling, we showed that including key microbial traits improve on average more than >50% of the total variances of ES proxies, that is, ammonium (math formula) or nitrate (math formula) leaching, and soil organic matter content. Geographic differences arose when considering the direct relationships of these ES proxies with specific microbial traits: nitrate leaching was positively correlated to the maximum rate of nitrification, except in the Austrian site and potentially leached math formula–N was negatively correlated to the fungi/bacteria ratio, with the exception of the French site. Synthesis and applications. The integration of soil microbial functional traits in the assessment of nitrogen-related grassland ecosystem services has direct contributions for understanding sustainable management of grassland ecosystems. The fundamental aspects of this study suggest that integrating a soil microbial component in grassland management may enhance sustainability of such grass-based agroecosystems.","Soil organic matter,Soil fertility,Nutrient cycle,Microbial ecology,Leaching (agriculture),Functional ecology,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,RRNA Operon,Phylogenetics,Microbial ecology,Trophic level,Trait,Plant species,Terrestrial ecosystem,Species richness,Soil water,Terrestrial ecosystem,Soil food web,Soil biology,Soil water,Soil respiration,Soil pH,Structural equation modeling,Statistics,Statistical power,Trait,Plant functional type,Life history theory,Taxon,Species diversity,Soil microbiology,Soil water,Soil organic matter,Rhizosphere","Thomas Pommier,Amélie A.

The A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP79/150 is a multivalent scaffolding protein that coordinates the subcellular localization of second-messenger-regulated enzymes, such as protein kinase A, protein kinase C and protein phosphatase 2B. We developed a new strategy that combines RNA interference of the endogenous protein with a protocol that selects cells that have been rescued with AKAP79/150 forms that are unable to anchor selected enzymes. Using this approach, we show that AKAP79/150 coordinates different enzyme combinations to modulate the activity of two distinct neuronal ion channels: AMPA-type glutamate receptors and M-type potassium channels. Utilization of distinct enzyme combinations in this manner provides a means to expand the repertoire of cellular events that the same AKAP modulates.","Subcellular localization,Scaffold protein,RNA interference,Protein kinase C,Protein kinase A,Potassium channel,Molecular biology,Ion channel,Enzyme,Cell biology,Biology,Biochemistry,Personal genomics,Hybrid genome assembly,Genome,Sequence-tagged site,Reference genome,Hybrid genome assembly,Genetics,Cognitive science,Biology,Transport protein,Small molecule,Signal transduction,Second messenger system,Phosphorylation,Phosphatase,Synapse assembly,Synapse,Postsynaptic potential,Synaptic plasticity,Synaptic fatigue,Silent synapse,c-Raf,Scaffold protein,Protein kinase C,Signal transduction,Scaffold protein,Protein kinase A,Synaptic plasticity,Receptor,Protein kinase A","Naoto Hoshi,Lorene K.

Three small farms, located in Amparo County, in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, were studied. One of them, Duas Cachoeiras farm, uses agroecological concepts for its agricultural production. The two others (Santa Helena farm and Tres Lagos farm) use the conventional chemical model. In an attempt to improve the precision of the data used in emergy analysis, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was incorporated to the GIS tool to calculate the topsoil loss in the farms. The GIS tool also allowed the calculation of the amount of rain water that infiltrates the ground and can recharge the aquifer. This percolated water is a system output and was incorporated in the emergy accounting. Another modification in comparison to previous emergy analyses was that the renewability factor of each input was considered in the emergy accounting. Results showed that the agroecological farm is more sustainable and can be used as a model for small farms in their transition to ecological agriculture. The GIS–emergy tools were used to compare the environmental performance of the four main productive areas of Duas Cachoeiras farm (annual cultures, orchard, forest, and pasture). These results demonstrate the emergy performance of each kind of land use and may be used in watershed planning.","Watershed,Universal Soil Loss Equation,Statistics,Land use,Groundwater recharge,Geographic information system,Environmental protection,Emergy,Biology,Agroecology,Agricultural science,Agricultural productivity,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Geography,Environmental resource management,Transformity,International exchange,Environmental resource management,Recession,Physics,Peak oil,Throughput accounting,Sustainability,Natural capital accounting,WEPP,Universal Soil Loss Equation,Soil type,Transformity,Natural resource economics,Environmental science,Waste management,Waste disposal,Valorisation,Water resource management,Universal Soil Loss Equation,Soil loss tolerance,Transformity,Sustainability,Statistics","Feni Agostinho,Guaraci Diniz,Raúl Siche,Enrique Ortega,Robert Costanza,Rudolf de Groot,Stephen Farberk,Monica Grasso,Bruce Hannon,Walter V.

841,Caste dominance and economic performance in rural India,2014-01-01,Economic Development and Cultural Change,10.1086/675388,"Using household panel data for rural India covering 1993-94 and 2004-5, we test whether scheduled castes (SCs) and other minority groups perform better or worse in terms of income when resident in villages dominated by (i) upper castes or (ii) their own group. Theoretically, upper-caste dominance comprises a potential ""proximity gain"" and offsetting group-specific ""oppression"" effects. For SCs and other backward classes (OBCs), initial proximity gains dominate negative oppression effects because upper-caste-dominated villages are located in more productive areas: once agroecology is controlled for, proximity and oppression effects cancel each other out. Although the effects are theoretically ambiguous, we find large, positive own-dominance or enclave effects for upper castes, OBCs, and especially SCs. These village regime effects are restricted to the Hindu social groups. Combining pathway and income source analysis, we close in on the mechanisms underpinning identity-based income disparities; while education matters, landownership accounts for most enclave effects. A strong postreform SC own-village advantage turns out to have agricultural rather than nonfarm or business origins. We also find upper-caste dominance to inhibit the educational progress of other social groups, along with negative enclave effects on the educational progress of Muslim women and scheduled tribe men.","Tribe,Sociology,Social group,Panel data,Oppression,Nonfarm payrolls,Hinduism,Development economics,Caste,Agroecology,Statistics,Quasi-likelihood,Multilevel model,Social identity approach,Social exclusion,Psychology of self,World economy,Tax reform,Public policy,Welfare,Voucher,Treatment and control groups,Technical change,Profitability index,Panel data,Survey data collection,New economy,Microeconomics,Relative term,Poverty,Macroeconomics,Social group,Social exclusion,Rapid expansion,Socioeconomics,Social background,Rural india,Spanish Civil War,Poverty,Geography","Vegard Iversen,Adriaan Kalwij,Arjan Verschoor,Amaresh Dubey,A.

842,Is production intensification likely to make farm households food-adequate? A simple food availability analysis across smallholder farming systems from East and West Africa,2017-01-01,Food Security,10.1007/S12571-016-0638-Y,"Despite considerable development investment, food insecurity remains prevalent throughout East and West Africa. The concept of ‘sustainable intensification’ of agricultural production has been promoted as a means to meet growing food needs in these regions. However, inadequate attention has been given to assessing whether benefits from intensification would be realized by farm households considering highly diverse resource endowments, household and farm characteristics, and agroecological contexts. In this study, we apply a simple energy-based index of food availability to 1800 households from research sites in 7 countries in East and West Africa to assess the food availability status of each of these households and to quantify the contribution of different on- and off-farm activities to food availability. We estimate the effects of two production intensification strategies on food availability: increased cereal crop production from crop-based options, and increased production of key livestock products from livestock-based options. These two options are contrasted with a third strategy: increased off-farm income for each household from broader socioeconomic-based options. Using sensitivity analysis, each strategy is tested against baseline values via incremental production increases. Baseline results exhibit considerable diversity within and across sites in household food availability status and livelihood strategies. Interventions represented in the crop and livestock options may primarily benefit food-adequate and marginally food-inadequate households, and have little impact on the most food-inadequate households. The analysis questions what production intensification can realistically achieve for East and West African smallholders, and how intensification strategies must be augmented with transformational strategies to reach the poorest households.","Socioeconomic status,Livestock,Livelihood,Household income,Food security,Economics,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural economics,Vulnerability,Psychological resilience,Human Development Report,Sustainable development,Public policy,Political economy of climate change,Sustainable agriculture,Soil conservation,Integrated pest management,Population,Operations research,Expert consultation,Sustainability,Manure,Livestock,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Soil management,Yield gap,Sustainability,Land use,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Socioeconomics,Rural area,South asia,Sorghum,Food security,Sustainability,Small farm,Rural area","R.S.

Evaluation of changes in weed flora in arable fields of Nordic countries – based on Danish long-term surveys. Weed Research51, 214–226. Summary During the last 50 years, agricultural productivity has increased tremendously, as have changes in the weed flora. In several European countries, weed surveys have been conducted regularly, of which the most frequent and consistent ones are Danish surveys conducted in 1911–1915, 1945, 1960–1970, 1987–1989 and 2001–2004. The surveys were carried out on fields not sprayed with herbicide in the sampling year. On the basis of this frame of reference, we discuss the changes in the weed flora during this period and relate them to findings in other Nordic countries and review the role of different farming practices on the weed flora of the past. Numerous agronomic factors and political initiatives to protect the environment have operated in concert. During the last 30 years, winter-sown crops have increased by almost 70%, at the expense of spring annual crops and grass leys, and this has favoured winter annual weed species. Maize is now widely grown and new weed species are invading arable land. Also, increased fertilisation levels over time have affected the weed flora. It is, however, obvious that herbicides play a major role in determining the composition, diversity and abundance of weed flora, although other factors such as mechanisation and the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU are also important. For the last 20 years, we have experienced an increase in some of the most frequent weed species without reductions in yield. This is probably due to governmental policies mandating lower herbicide efficacy goals for farmers, but it has been partly counteracted by genetic improvement of crops and better management.","Weed control,Weed,Intensive farming,Botany,Biology,Biodiversity,Arable land,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat,Pesticide resistance,Pesticide,Management practices,Tillage,Strip-till,Soil structure,Weed science,Weed control,Weed,Weed control,Weed,Sustainable agriculture,Stellaria media,Predation,Population,Wildlife,Weed control,Weed,Weed control,Weed,Species diversity,Weed,Vegetation,Species richness,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide resistance","C Andreasen,J C Streibig,Tim G.

Many of the practices that contribute to the overall strategies are well known—such as intensive use of cover crops or reduced tillage. Reasons for why they have not been more widely used are discussed. The special challenges facing ecological agriculture in the poor countries of the Third World are also discussed.

This qualitative study was designed to evaluate the impact of the Limited Access Permit (LAP) legislation in Oregon and to understand the relationship between dental hygienists and dentists within this delivery system. The snowball sampling technique was used to identify LAP dental hygienists and collaborating dentists. The snowball sampling technique begins with the identification of a known expert in the field who serves as the initial “sampling unit.” Subsequent individuals are then recommended, or nominated, to the investigator by the initial study participant and are selected based upon the need to fill in or extend information. The final sample consisted of seven LAP dental hygienists and two collaborating dentists. Interviews, field observations, and document analysis were utilized for data collection. Factors that led to the creation of LAP dental hygiene practice, current LAP practice, personal characteristics, relationships between LAP dental hygienists and dentists, and the impact that LAP dental hygienists have had on access to oral health care were explored. Data revealed that the Oregon legislature twice expanded the LAP scope of practice to increase access to oral health care services. LAP dental hygienists practice in community and school-based settings. Common characteristics of LAP dental hygienists include entrepreneurship, lifelong learning, and a commitment to underserved populations. The findings from this study indicate that LAP dental hygienists and collaborating dentists have positive relationships. No evidence of lower quality of care in unsupervised dental hygiene practices was found. However, the impact of the LAP legislation is still unknown due to the limited numbers of LAP dental hygienists and the early nature of the LAP practice.","Underserved Population,Snowball sampling,Scope of practice,Qualitative research,Medicine,Medical education,Limited access,Lifelong learning,Legislation,Family medicine,Document analysis,Theoretical sampling,Sociology,Social science,Strategic planning,Public health,Orthodontics,Sociology,Social science,Research methodology,Statute,Reimbursement,Professional practice,Solo Practices,Referral,Quarter (United States coin),Practice management,Occupational safety and health,Medicine,Statistic,Psychology,Mail survey,Skills management,Nursing,Minimal supervision,Stratified sampling,Response rate (survey),Psychology","Ann M.

849,Enset in Ethiopia: a poorly characterized but resilient starch staple.,2019-01-01,Annals of Botany,10.1093/AOB/MCY214,"BACKGROUND: Enset (Ensete ventricosum, Musaceae) is an African crop that currently provides the staple food for approx. 20 million Ethiopians. Whilst wild enset grows over much of East and Southern Africa and the genus extends across Asia to China, it has only ever been domesticated in the Ethiopian Highlands. Here, smallholder farmers cultivate hundreds of landraces across diverse climatic and agroecological systems. SCOPE: Enset has several important food security traits. It grows over a relatively wide range of conditions, is somewhat drought-tolerant, and can be harvested at any time of the year, over several years. It provides an important dietary starch source, as well as fibres, medicines, animal fodder, roofing and packaging. It stabilizes soils and microclimates and has significant cultural importance. In contrast to the other cultivated species in the family Musaceae (banana), enset has received relatively little research attention. Here, we review and critically evaluate existing research, outline available genomic and germplasm resources, aspects of pathology, and explore avenues for crop development. CONCLUSION: Enset is an underexploited starch crop with significant potential in Ethiopia and beyond. Research is lacking in several key areas: empirical studies on the efficacy of current agronomic practices, the genetic diversity of landraces, approaches to systematic breeding, characterization of existing and emerging diseases, adaptability to new ranges and land-use change, the projected impact of climate change, conservation of crop wild relatives, by-products or co-products or non-starch uses, and the enset microbiome. We also highlight the limited availability of enset germplasm in living collections and seedbanks, and the lack of knowledge of reproductive and germination biology needed to underpin future breeding. By reviewing the current state of the art in enset research and identifying gaps and opportunities, we hope to catalyse the development and sustainable exploitation of this neglected starch crop.","Sustainable agriculture,Staple food,Germplasm,Food security,Ecology,Domestication,Crop,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Pandanales,Liliales,Icacinales,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Soil biology,Root microbiome,Rhizosphere,Technical progress,Plant production,Natural resource economics,Temperate climate,Plant production,Food security,Zingiberales,Poales,Plant genetics,Livelihood,Green Revolution,Food security,Vegetation,Remote sensing,Random forest,Plant disease resistance,PEST analysis,Introgression","Borrell Js,Biswas Mk,Goodwin M,Blomme G,H.

Such studies are numerous with annual crops and grasslands yet infrequent in more complex and structurally stable arboreal croplands, where high capacity to retain biodiversity is expected. Here, we explore to what extent landscape complexity and extensification of agricultural practices enhance biodiversity in olive groves of Andalusia (southern Spain). We monitored birds, ants and herbs in paired olive farms (extensive versus intensive ground herb cover management) from 20 localities spread over Andalusia and along a landscape complexity gradient. For each biological group, we obtained gamma diversity (diversity at the olive farm level), beta diversity (between the productive and unproductive areas located within the olive farm) and infield alpha diversity (in the productive area within the olive farm). We tested for multi-diversity, and for each group separately, three major hypotheses of the LMB: the intermediate-landscape complexity, the dominance of beta diversity, and the landscape species pool hypotheses. These hypotheses were corroborated with multi-diversity, which was affected by intensification of weed management and landscape simplification, suffering a combined impact of 26% of gamma biodiversity loss. The effectiveness of extensification to recover biodiversity depended on the landscape context and peaked at intermediate-complexity landscapes. Beta multi-diversity and infield alpha-diversity increased with landscape complexity. Birds, ants and weeds responded differently but were negatively affected either by landscape simplification or by management intensification. Birds mirrored better than other groups the multi-diversity pattern and were the best candidates for a rapid indicator of the impact of agriculture and land conversion on biodiversity. We provide recommendations for biodiversity conservation in olive groves-dominated landscapes and show that, if adequately managed, olive groves’ landscapes have potential for the conservation of biodiversity in the Mediterranean region. Our results illustrate the need to reformulate the future EU-Common Agricultural Policy and particularly, to adapt AES to each landscape.","Gamma diversity,Conservation biology,Biology,Biodiversity,Beta diversity,Alpha diversity,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural policy,Umbrella species,Regional Red List,Red List Index,Statistics,Regression,Recursive partitioning,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Wildlife conservation,Land management,Habitat,Species richness,Species diversity,Sampling (statistics),Vegetation,Terrestrial ecosystem,Soil retrogression and degradation,Spatial heterogeneity,Moderation,Landscape epidemiology","Pedro J.

Various strategies for adaptation to climate change have been proposed. In this paper we examine the prospects of what we call the ‘transgenic adaptation strategy’, i.e. the appeal to use transgenic seeds to adapt to climate change, through the lens of smallholder maize farming in Mexico. Landraces are the bedrock of maize production in Mexico. We consider how maize farmers may respond to climate change and the effects of those responses on crop diversity. In this paper, we argue that the promotion of the transgenic adaptation strategy is problematic for biological and social reasons. Smallholder livelihoods in southern Mexico could suffer a disproportionate negative impact if transgenic technology is privileged as a response to climate change. Agroecological and evolutionary approaches to addressing the effects of climate change on smallholder agriculture provides an alternative adaptive strategy.","Subsistence agriculture,Effects of global warming,Economics,Crop diversity,Climate justice,Climate change,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,South asia,Natural resource economics,Malnutrition,Growing season,Geography,Food prices,Negative response,Land use,Growing season,Plant genetics,Molecular marker,Introgression,Senescence,Photosynthesis,Genetically modified crops,Simulation modeling,Poverty,Latin Americans,Socioeconomics,Poverty,Natural resource economics,Vulnerability,Typology,Risk management,Water conservation,Species translocation,Restoration ecology","Kristin L.

In this study, the trend and variability of rainfall were compared with the perception of farmers in northern Ethiopia. Daily rainfall data obtained from five meteorological stations located in different agroecological zones were used to determine trends in annual and seasonal totals, onset and cessation dates, length of growing period (LGP) and dry spell length. Sen’s estimator and Mann-Kendall's statistical tests were used for trend detection. Two hundred fifty three farmers from three administrative areas (districts) that are close to the meteorological stations were interviewed in order to investigate farmers' perception on rainfall trend and variability in the study area. The results indicate that rainfall in the region is highly variable with a non-significant trend in both annual and seasonal totals for all stations. However, trends of rainfall events such as onset date, cessation date, LGP, and dry spell length were changed significantly in most stations, which agreed with the farmers’ perception. Moreover, most stations experienced drought conditions in the last decade. The results suggest the need for designing appropriate agronomic and water management strategies to offset the negative impacts of rainfall variability in the study area.","Tropics,Trend detection,Seasonality,Precipitation,Physical geography,Perception,Onset date,Geography,Dry spell,Agroecology,Tree planting,Soil conservation,Socioeconomics,Time series,Marketing,Business,Trend detection,Trend analysis,Spatial distribution,Tropical Eastern Pacific,Trend analysis,Teleconnection,Rift valley,Precipitation index,Precipitation,Watershed,Trend surface analysis,Trend analysis,Perception,Natural resource economics,Conservation agriculture,Wet season,Plateau,Participant observation,Statistical mean,Statistical analysis,Precipitation,Trend surface analysis,Teleconnection,Spatial variability","Gebre Hadgu,Kindie Tesfaye Fantaye,Girma Mamo,Belay Kassa,Temesgen Tadesse Deressa,Rashid M.

Among numerous candidates, c-LLZO offers multiple desirable properties: high ionic conductivities (0.1–1 mS cm−1), Li stability, a wide electrochemical operating window (∼6 V) and pH stability (7–11.5). However, incorporation into prototype cells has yet to be demonstrated as c-LLZO membranes at thicknesses <50 μm have not been achieved. Processing dense, thin films matching bulk counterpart properties remains a very difficult target arising from energy and/or equipment intensive sintering, Li volatilization, and contamination from substrates. We show that using metalloorganic derived flame made nanoparticles can overcome these processing challenges resulting in a significantly reduced energy input required for densification, 10–40 fold shorter dwell times at sintering temperatures, compared to common solid state reaction derived c-LLZO. Furthermore, surface/volume ratios of the films are determined to be a critical factor affecting final microstructures and phase compositions of the sintered films. Through careful control of the processing variables, 10–15 grains thick, dense (94 ± 1%) c-LLZO thin (<30 μm), flexible films with high ambient ionic conductivities (0.2 ± 0.03 mS cm−1) are achieved using conventional casting–sintering of flame made nanoparticles.

However, for many agricultural situations there is a lack of understanding about the structure of biological and ecological relationships that drive resource dynamics. Therefore, it remains a challenge to build tools for farmers and advisors that fit with these uncertainties and that are generic. In this paper, we define an “agroecological engineering” approach from a combination of several methods of knowledge production: analytical methods that are de-contextualised (e.g. experimentation, on-farm observations) and holistic and contextualised methods based on workshops and training sessions with stakeholders. The key feature of the approach is the construction of a “boundary object”, i.e. a support facilitating the communication between researchers and stakeholders, which evolves from a premise into a support tool during the course of a research project and then helps organise knowledge flows between methods. Two long-term studies involving grassland management were used to illustrate the approach. Based on these examples and on the literature, we show that the approach needs to address four issues for defining generic operational tools to find site-specific solutions: aims and principles of the approach, development of tool support throughout a research project, knowledge flow among knowledge-production methods, and the function of agroecosystem models. A remaining scientific challenge is the extrapolation of tool prototypes outside the case studies on which they were based.","Sustainable agriculture,Premise,Management science,Management practices,Knowledge production,Grassland management,Economics,Boundary object,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Scholarship,Water balance,Systems design,Supply chain,Viewpoints,Vertebrate zoology,Trading zones,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Natural capital,Trait,Plant functional type,Life history theory,Watershed,Systems simulation,Soil water,Stakeholder engagement,Stakeholder analysis,Stakeholder,Team learning,Social psychology,Social learning,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Process management,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture","M.

What agricultural strategies are needed to meet these challenges? To what extent are there synergies among these strategies? This paper examines these issues for smallholder producers in Kenya across several agroecological zones. Several practices emerge as triple wins, supporting climate adaptation, greenhouse gas mitigation, and profitability goals. In particular, integrated soil fertility management and improved livestock feeding are shown to provide multiple benefits across all agroecological zones examined. Triple wins of other agricultural practices are limited to specific agroecological zones. Irrigation and soil and water conservation, for example, are essential for adaptation, mitigation, and profitability in arid areas. The results suggest that agricultural investments targeted toward these triple-win strategies will have the greatest payoff in terms of increased resilience of farm and pastoralist households and global climate change mitigation. To reap the benefits of triple-win strategies will require that policymakers, researchers, and practitioners move away from isolated approaches focused on either adaptation or mitigation or rural income generation toward a more holistic assessment of joint strategies as well as their tradeoffs and synergies.","Soil conservation,Psychological resilience,Profitability index,Livelihood,Greenhouse gas,Global warming,Environmental resource management,Economics,Agroecology,Agriculture,Runaway climate change,Physical science,IPCC Fourth Assessment Report,Environmental science,Climatology,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Soil fertility,Systems engineering,Software design,Software,Primary market,Market price,International economics,Tree planting,Soil conservation,Socioeconomics,Vulnerability,Sustainable development,Political economy of climate change,Sustainability,Manure,Livestock,Precipitation,Meteorology,Land cover,Tree planting,Subsistence agriculture,Soil conservation","Elizabeth Bryan,Claudia Ringler,Barrack Okoba,Jawoo Koo,Jonathan Gregory,Ronald J.

857,Physiological and microbial adjustments to diet quality permit facultative herbivory in an omnivorous lizard,2016-01-01,The Journal of Experimental Biology,10.1242/JEB.138370,"ABSTRACT While herbivory is a common feeding strategy in a number of vertebrate classes, less than 4% of squamate reptiles feed primarily on plant material. It has been hypothesized that physiological or microbial limitations may constrain the evolution of herbivory in lizards. Herbivorous lizards exhibit adaptations in digestive morphology and function that allow them to better assimilate plant material. However, it is unknown whether these traits are fixed or perhaps phenotypically flexible as a result of diet. Here, we maintained a naturally omnivorous lizard, Liolaemus ruibali, on a mixed diet of 50% insects and 50% plant material, or a plant-rich diet of 90% plant material. We compared parameters of digestive performance, gut morphology and function, and gut microbial community structure between the two groups. We found that lizards fed the plant-rich diet maintained nitrogen balance and exhibited low minimum nitrogen requirements. Additionally, lizards fed the plant-rich diet exhibited significantly longer small intestines and larger hindguts, demonstrating that gut morphology is phenotypically flexible. Lizards fed the plant-rich diet harbored small intestinal communities that were more diverse and enriched in Melainabacteria and Oscillospira compared with mixed diet-fed lizards. Additionally, the relative abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the small intestine significantly correlated with whole-animal fiber digestibility. Thus, we suggest that physiological and microbial limitations do not sensu stricto constrain the evolution of herbivory in lizards. Rather, ecological context and fitness consequences may be more important in driving the evolution of this feeding strategy.","Vertebrate,Omnivore,Nitrogen balance,Microbial population biology,Lizard,Herbivore,Facultative,Ecology,Digestion,Biology,Software,MEDLINE,Imagej plugin,mothur,Throughput,Sequencing data,UniFrac,Supplementary data,Sequence clustering,UniFrac,Synergistetes,Ribosomal RNA,Throughput,Illumina dye sequencing,Genetics,Roseburia,Microbiome,Microbiology,UniFrac,Taxon,Sediment,User interface,Software portability,Software,Zoology,Phylogenetics,Omnivore,Statistical hypothesis testing,Statistical assumption,Ordination","Kevin D.

We first addressed: (i) the regulation of arthropod communities by weed diversity at genetic, species and habitat levels, (ii) the regulation of weed communities by arthropods through seed predation and dispersal and (iii) belowground weed-insect interactions. We then focussed on methodologies to study weed–arthropod interactions in agricultural landscapes and discuss techniques potentially available for data analysis and the importance of joint weed–arthropod trend detection. Lastly, we discuss the implications of research findings for biodiversity conservation policies (agri-environmental schemes) and suggest some priorities for future work. Results showed that to date research has largely ignored weed–arthropod interactions in agricultural landscapes. No information is available on the role of weed genetic diversity as driver of weed–arthropod interactions, whereas studies on effects of species and habitat diversity often lack a functional perspective and ⁄ or a spatial component. Also, information on how management of the wider agricultural biotope might express positive weed– arthropod functional interactions is scarce. Another area worth being explored is the relationship between weed-leaf ⁄ root herbivores and beneficial arthropods. Tools for spatial data analysis might be useful for elucidating weed–arthropod interactions in agricultural landscapes, but some methodological aspects, e.g. the definition of the most appropriate experimental design and sampling scale ⁄ frequency, must be refined. New studies on weed–arthropod interactions should encompass an explicit spatial component; this knowledge is particularly important for improving IPM ⁄ IWM systems and designing more targeted agri-environmental","Weed,Herbivore,Habitat,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Botany,Biology,Biological dispersal,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation,Wildlife conservation,Species richness,Landscape-scale conservation,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Total human ecosystem,Single species,Quantitative genetics,Stakeholder,Science policy,Rural area,Soybean aphid,Pest control,PEST analysis,Population genetics,Population,Keystone species,Stochastic simulation,Stochastic modelling,Spatial analysis,Spatial ecology,Population size,Population,Trophic level,Structural complexity,Spatial ecology","P Bàrberi,G Burgio,G Dinelli,A C Moonen,S Otto,C Vazzana,G Zanin,Douglas A.

859,Knowledge politics in participatory climate change adaptation research on agroecology in Malawi,2018-01-01,Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems,10.1017/S1742170518000017,"Climate change is projected to have severe implications for smallholder agriculture in Africa, with increased temperatures, increased drought and flooding occurrence, and increased rainfall variability. Given these projections, there is a need to identify effective strategies to help rural communities adapt to climatic risks. Yet, relatively little research has examined the politics and social dynamics around knowledge and sources of information about climate-change adaptation with smallholder farming communities. This paper uses a political ecology approach to historically situate rural people's experiences with a changing climate. Using the concept of the co-production of knowledge, we examine how Malawian smallholder farmers learn, perceive, share and apply knowledge about a changing climate, and what sources they draw on for agroecological methods in this context. As well, we pay particular attention to agricultural knowledge flows within and between households. We ask two main questions: Whose knowledge counts in relation to climate-change adaptation? What are the political, social and environmental implications of these knowledge dynamics? We draw upon a long-term action research project on climate-change adaptation that involved focus groups, interviews, observations, surveys, and participatory agroecology experiments with 425 farmers. Our findings are consistent with other studies, which found that agricultural knowledge sources were shaped by gender and other social inequalities, with women more reliant on informal networks than men. Farmers initially ranked extension services as important sources of knowledge about farming and climate change. After farmers carried out participatory agroecological research, they ranked their own observation and informal farmer networks as more important sources of knowledge. Contradictory ideas about climate-change adaptation, linked to various positions of power, gaps of knowledge and social inequalities make it challenging for farmers to know how to act despite observing changes in rainfall. Participatory agroecological approaches influenced adaptation strategies used by smallholder farmers in Malawi, but most still maintained the dominant narrative about climate-change causes, which focused on local deforestation by rural communities.

Applying a theoretical framework that incorporates territorial struggle, agroecology and popular education, we examine spatial and organizational aspects of each of these models for peasant education and movement-building. Recognizing that the models, their respective contexts, and the dialectical relationships therein have been in constant evolution, we share findings on the movement-place as a territorial system with socio-historical subjectivity, that is, peasant movements as territorially-embedded, collective historical actors. This leads to some conclusions in moving past educational theory that has centered upon individual subjects, and approaching a conception of territory as a subject of learning processes.","Subjectivity,Social movement,Popular education,Peasant,History general,Epistemology,Environmental resource management,Education theory,Economics,Dialectic,Agroecology,Zone of proximal development,Sociocultural perspective,Social psychology,Sustainable development,Rural sociology,Politics,Political economy,Peasant,Economics,Sociology,Social science,Political ecology,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Politics,Point of departure,Neoliberalism,Social movement,Peasant,Grassroots,Western Apache,Sense of place,Scholarship,Valuation (finance),Sociology,Food systems,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability","Nils McCune,Marlen Sánchez,Lev Vygotsky,Jan Douwe van der Ploeg,James C.

862,Organic fields sustain weed metacommunity dynamics in farmland landscapes.,2015-01-01,Proceedings of The Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,10.1098/RSPB.2015.0002,"Agro-ecosystems constitute essential habitat for many organisms. Agricultural intensification, however, has caused a strong decline of farmland biodiversity. Organic farming (OF) is often presented as a more biodiversity-friendly practice, but the generality of the beneficial effects of OF is debated as the effects appear often species- and context-dependent, and current research has highlighted the need to quantify the relative effects of local- and landscape-scale management on farmland biodiversity. Yet very few studies have investigated the landscape-level effects of OF; that is to say, how the biodiversity of a field is affected by the presence or density of organically farmed fields in the surrounding landscape. We addressed this issue using the metacommunity framework, with weed species richness in winter wheat within an intensively farmed landscape in France as model system. Controlling for the effects of local and landscape structure, we showed that OF leads to higher local weed diversity and that the presence of OF in the landscape is associated with higher local weed biodiversity also for conventionally farmed fields, and may reach a similar biodiversity level to organic fields in field margins. Based on these results, we derive indications for improving the sustainable management of farming systems.","Weed,Species richness,Organic farming,Metacommunity,Environmental science,Ecosystem,Ecology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Mixed effects,Geography,Applied mathematics,Nonlinear system,Nonlinear mixed effects model,Mixed effects,Statistical inference,Statistical hypothesis testing,Random effects model,Statistics,Statistical model,Model selection,Species sorting,Patch dynamics,Neutral model,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide,Unified neutral theory of biodiversity,Storage effect,Species diversity,Type I and type II errors,Statistics,Statistical model,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat,Statistics,Standardized coefficient,Mathematics","Laura Henckel,Luca Börger,Helmut Meiss,Sabrina Gaba,Vincent Bretagnolle,Douglas Bates,Martin Maechler,Ben Bolker,Steven Walker,Josae C.

863,Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic influences carabid beetles in agricultural landscapes,2016-01-01,Landscape Ecology,10.1007/S10980-015-0259-4,"Context Landscape spatio-temporal heterogeneity is regarded as an important driver of biodiversity. In agricultural landscapes, the composition and configuration of cultivated fields and their multi-year dynamics should be considered. But the habitat-matrix paradigm in landscape ecology has resulted in little consideration of cropped areas. Objectives The main objective of our study was to determine the influences of spatial and multi-year temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic on carabid beetle assemblages of agricultural landscapes. Methods Carabids were sampled in 40 cereal fields in western France, and their species richness, total abundance and abundance of species groups with different dispersal abilities were measured. For each sampling site, we computed different metrics that characterized crop mosaic spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We quantified relationships between carabid assemblages and heterogeneity metrics and tested their significance. Results Total carabid abundance increased with increase in temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic. However, all species were not influenced in the same way by spatial and temporal heterogeneity metrics. Some species with high dispersal power such as Trechus quadristriatus were more abundant in landscapes with high spatial heterogeneity, whereas the abundance of less mobile species such as Poecilus cupreus were only positively influenced by temporal crop dynamics. Conclusion Our results suggest that both the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic affects farmland biodiversity, at least for species that use crops during their life cycle or disperse through fields. We highlight the importance of taking this heterogeneity into account in further ecological studies on biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.","Species richness,Spatial heterogeneity,Poecilus cupreus,Landscape epidemiology,Landscape ecology,Ecology,Biology,Biological dispersal,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Software engineering,Software analytics,Reference software,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Statistics,Statistical model,Model selection,Vegetation,Statistics,Regression,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Random forest,Predictor variables,Machine learning,Spatial analysis,Landscape structure,Landscape pattern,Regression analysis,Random forest,Predictor variables,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat,Tree (graph theory),Statistics,Regression analysis","Colette Bertrand,Françoise Burel,Jacques Baudry,R Core Team,Jonathan A.

This is expected to be achieved by enhancing natural enemy abundance and functional efficiency through the designing of areas surrounding crops to provide alternative food sources (e.g., pollen, nectar, or prey) or escapes from agricultural disturbances (refugia) (2, 5). Now, in a metaanalysis on the role of surrounding vegetation on crop pests and their natural enemies, Karp et al. (6) come to the conclusion that there is no such general rule when the data are examined globally, across crops, landscapes, and biogeographical areas. Thus, on the surface, the conclusion questions what is assumed to be one of the core beliefs of many people working in the area of agroecology, especially those who regard agroecology rather as a philosophy than as a research field (7). Karp et al. (6) have compiled a pest-control database of over 130 studies, encompassing more than 6,700 sites worldwide to “model natural enemy and pest abundances, predation rates, and crop damage as a function of landscape composition.” While this database, made publicly available, is already a huge achievement in itself, it remains to be seen whether further inputs can significantly contribute to the intended purpose, “to answer critical questions about the ecology of pest control,” or whether its value will be mostly found in other ways, such as providing the beginnings of a global “taxonomy” of farmscapes through the lens of pest-control literature.

We conducted 2 years of point count censuses for summer resident birds, 2 years of Sherman live trapping for small mammals, and gathered vegetation structure data at 147 sampling points distributed over 16 sites spanning a cultivation intensification gradient. We calculated net annual revenue per hectare as an index of profitability from economic and management data collected during interviews with plantation owners/managers. Both the species richness and abundance of forest-affiliated birds were significantly greater in floristically and structurally diverse 'bajo monte' coffee and forest compared with commercial polyculture coffee, which was, in turn, significantly richer than statistically indistinguishable specialized shade and sun coffee. Mammal capture rates were extremely low at all but two sites. Forest bird species richness and abundance were explained by multiple linear regression models that included statistically significant effects of shade cover, percent of trees with epiphytes, and canopy height. We found no clear relationship between profitability and biodiversity, with biodiverse bajo monte coffee plantations ranking among the most profitable under all price scenarios. The high profitability of biodiverse bajo monte coffee systems was not dependent on the inclusion of long-term environmental costs or premium pricing systems. Our results demonstrate that high-biodiversity coffee cultivation can be compatible with high profitability, and has significant potential for conserving biodiversity in coffee-growing regions, but only as a substitute for low-biodiversity coffee cultivation, not forest.","Vegetation,Species richness,Hectare,Ecosystem,Canopy,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Valuation (finance),Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Taxonomy (biology),Plumage,Ornithology,Secondary forest,Predation,Population decline,Politics,Market economy,International trade,Ecology,Biology,Vegetation,Temperate climate,Species richness,Rainforest,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Species richness,Riparian zone,Pollinator","Caleb Gordon,Robert Manson,Jeffrey Sundberg,Andrea Cruz-Angón,Robert Costanza,Rudolf de Groot,Stephen Farberk,Monica Grasso,Bruce Hannon,Gretchen C.

870,Distribution of Aspergillus section Flavi in soils of maize fields in three agroecological zones of Nigeria,2008-01-01,Soil Biology & Biochemistry,10.1016/J.SOILBIO.2008.09.013,"Abstract Fungal communities in soils of Nigerian maize fields were examined to determine distributions of aflatoxin-producing fungi and to identify endemic atoxigenic strains of potential value as biological control agents for limiting aflatoxin contamination in West African crops. Over 1000 isolates belonging to Aspergillus section Flavi were collected from soil of 55 Nigerian maize fields located in three agroecological zones by dilution plating onto modified Rose Bengal agar. The most common member of Aspergillus section Flavi (85% of isolates) was the A. flavus L-strain followed by the unnamed taxon known as strain S BG (8%), A. tamarii (6%) and A. parasiticus (1%). Highest incidence of S BG was in Zaria district, and lowest was in Ogbomosho and Ado-Ekiti districts. Only 44% of 492 A. flavus isolates produced aflatoxins in liquid fermentation (limit of detection 5 ng g −1 ). Thirty-two percent of the A. flavus isolates produced >1 μg g −1 total aflatoxins but no A. flavus isolate produced G aflatoxins. When the agroecological zones were compared, significantly ( P A. flavus isolates were found in the Northern Guinea Savannah (61%) than in Southern Guinea Savannah (31%). The Derived Savannah was intermediate between the other two agroecological zones. Each of the regions had atoxigenic strains of potential value as biological control agents. All S BG and A. parasiticus isolates produced both B and G aflatoxins and greater than 300 μg g −1 total aflatoxins. S BG and A. parasiticus isolates were the greatest contributors to the aflatoxin-producing potential of fungal communities in regions where these isolates occurred.","Soil water,Mycotoxin,Crop,Botany,Biology,Biological pest control,Aspergillus,Agroecology,Agar,Aflatoxin","Matthias Donner,Joseph Atehnkeng,Richard A.

A recent example is the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS). We investigate effects of different free allocation schemes on incentives and identify significant perverse effects on abatement and output employing a simple multi-period model. Firms have incentives for strategic action if allocation in one period depends on their actions in previous ones and thus can be influenced by them. These findings play a major role where trading schemes become increasingly popular as environmental or resource use policy instruments. This is of particular relevance in the EU-ETS where the current period is a trial-period before the first commitment period of the Kyoto protocol.

874,European transitions towards a corporate-environmental food regime: Agroecological incorporation or contestation?,2015-01-01,Journal of Rural Studies,10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2015.06.001,"Abstract The ‘food regime’ concept helps to analyse potential transitions beyond the agro-industrial regime which has been globally dominant since the 1970s. As its multiple crises generate alternative production methods and products, some have been incorporated into a nascent ‘corporate-environmental food regime’. This nascent regime is illustrated here by two agendas prominent in Europe – ‘bioeconomy’ (Life Sciences) and ‘sustainable intensification’ (neoproductivism). As a significant difference, the prevalent ‘bioeconomy’ agenda marginalises agroecological practices, while ‘sustainable intensification’ selectively incorporates such practices within a broader toolkit including biotech. Regardless of that difference, both agendas reinforce a neoliberal productivist narrative: namely, more resource-efficient methods are necessary for increasing production to fulfill the greater market demand for food, feed, fuel, etc. In this way, the capital-accumulation driver is reified as ‘market demand’ arising exogenously from the food production system – which thereby accommodates societal needs. By contrast, the agroecology narrative diagnoses the problem as profit-driven agro-industrial monoculture systems making farmers dependent on external inputs, undermining their knowledge, and distancing consumers from agri-producers. Through such a narrative, new alliances have elaborated a different future linking farmers' knowledge-exchange, agroecology, food sovereignty, citizens' initiatives, public knowledge about food production, etc. Civil society organisations have facilitated such linkages among researchers, scientists and social movements. In those ways, contending narratives justify different trajectories for an agro-food transition. Each links different innovation paradigms of technique, quality and knowledge. These differences often remain implicit amidst broad terms such as bioeconomy, sustainable intensification, agroecology, etc. Making the divergences explicit can help contest transitions towards a corporate-environmental food regime, while also counterposing agroecological alternatives.","Supply and demand,Socioeconomics,Social movement,Neoliberalism,Food sovereignty,Food processing,Economics,Economic system,Civil society,CONTEST,Agroecology",Les Levidow,http://oro.open.ac.uk/43587/,71,Agroecology Permit Emissions Greenhouse gas Offset
875,Agroecology and permaculture: addressing key ecological problems by rethinking and redesigning agricultural systems,2016-01-01,Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,10.1007/S13412-015-0254-8,"Abstract This paper explores how industrial agriculture is a key contributor to many ecological problems and how redesigning agricultural systems using agroecological principles and methods could address many of these problems. Agriculture uses 85 % of freshwater and, directly or indirectly, produces nearly half of all greenhouse gas emissions. Industrial agriculture accounts for a large proportion of these ecological costs and also depends on high energy use and toxic chemicals. Agroecology presents an alternative paradigm of production based on ecological principles such as recycling wastes, minimizing energy and water use, maximizing genetic diversity, regenerating soil and increasing its carbon content, integrating livestock and crops into a holistic system, and promoting other beneficial biological synergies. Moreover, agroecological methods have the potential to actually boost production and farm incomes, particularly in the global South. Permaculture, perhaps the most widely practiced form of agroecology, also provides an ethical framework and principles that serve as a basis for discerning actions that enable the design of diverse, sustainable systems suited to a wide variety of cultural and ecological contexts. Widespread adoption of agroecological methods and permaculture principles could significantly reduce energy, pesticide, and freshwater usage while simultaneously restoring degraded soil, sequestering large quantities of carbon, creating more biodiverse agricultural systems, and satisfying human needs for healthy, nutritious food. As well, engaging in ecological agriculture may encourage practitioners to develop genuinely ecological dispositions and worldviews that enable them to approach problems and discern actions from a perspective that systematically promotes sustainability and social justice.","Sustainable development,Sustainability,Permaculture,Intensive farming,Fundamental human needs,Ecology,Business,Agroecology,Agroecological restoration,Agriculture,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Sustainability,Political economy of climate change,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Omnivore,Natural history,Ethnology,World population,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Water use,Water resources,Virtual water,Terrestrial ecosystem,Marine ecosystem,Eutrophication,Water resources,Water conservation,Return flow,Sustainable development,Peasant,Food sovereignty,Wilcoxon signed-rank test,Vitamin C,Toxicology","Mark D.

But agroecology still has not developed instruments and approaches to elaborate state and regional strategies, where the political and institutional aspects play a key role. This text contributes to overcoming these oversights by means of a theoretical foundation that demonstrates why agroecology should engage politics. First, we argue that agroecosystems, as socioecological constructions, are produced through power relations. Second, we show the close relationship between agroecosystem dynamics and politics, and, therefore, the crucial role that political agroecology plays in the agroecological transition. Finally, we evaluate the world food system as the context in which agroecological experiences should be developed.","Sustainability,Public policy,Politics,Tragedy of the commons,Tragedy of the anticommons,Natural resource,Water resources,Sustainability,Socio-hydrology,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Political science,Sociology,Social issues,Political economy,Social exclusion,Political ecology,Natural resource,Sociology,Social movement,Rural area,Speculation,Monopoly,Market economy,Valuation (finance),Sociology,Food systems","Manuel Gonzalez de Molina,Elinor Ostrom,Elinor Ostrom,Miguel A.

This paper uses empirical data of seed exchange practices for sorghum in eastern Ethiopia to analyze how social relationships influence access to off-farm seed for a major crop. Seed shortfalls are common, and farmer–farmer exchange is important for providing locally-adapted seed to fill this gap, but access varies considerably among households, also affecting quantities supplied and terms of exchange. Preferred sources for off-farm seed (neighbors, government, market) also vary among farmers, reflecting agroecology and asset-ownership, but also differing access to these sources. Social network theories highlight the importance of reciprocal ties, and the cultural norms underpinning them, in accessing seed. These cultural norms are contested, with some claiming that commercial transactions are increasingly common. Implications for interventions supporting farmer seed systems, particularly emergency seed aid, are discussed in relation to the socially-mediated nature of seed access.","Social relation,Social network,Norm (social),Mutual aid,Moral economy,Government,Environmental resource management,Economics,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Sociology,Social control,Public administration,Political economy,Peasant,Economics,Sovereignty,Sociology,Social science,Politics,Political science,Gender studies,Social dynamics,Rural area,Peasant,Tropics,Plant ecology,Nature reserve,Socioeconomics,Psychological intervention,Opportunity cost,Tropics,Repertoire,Plant ecology,Subsistence agriculture,Southeast asia,Peasant,Socioeconomics,Social organization,Seed system","Shawn J.

878,Agroecology as a vehicle for contributive justice,2015-01-01,Agriculture and Human Values,10.1007/S10460-014-9581-8,"Agroecology has been criticized for being more labor-intensive than other more industrialized forms of agriculture. We challenge the assertion that labor input in agriculture has to be generally minimized and argue that besides quantity of work one should also consider the quality of work involved in farming. Early assessments on work quality condemned the deskilling of the rural workforce, whereas later criticisms have concentrated around issues related to fair trade and food sovereignty. We bring into the discussion the concept of contributive justice to welcome the added labor-intensity of agroecological farming. Contributive justice demands a work environment where people are stimulated to develop skills and learn to be productive. It also suggests a fairer distribution of meaningful work and tedious tasks. Building on the notion of contributive justice we explore which capabilities and types of social relationships are sustainably promoted and reinforced by agroecological farming practices. We argue that agroecological principles encourage a reconceptualization of farm work. Farmers are continuously stimulated to develop skills and acquire valuable experiential knowledge on local ecosystems and agricultural techniques. Further, generalized ecological studies recognize the significance of the farmer’s observations on natural resources management. This contributes to the development of a number of capabilities and leads to more bargaining power, facilitating self-determination. Hereby farm work is made more attractive to a younger generation, which is an essential factor for safeguarding the continuity of family farms.","Sustainability,Sociology,Natural resource management,Food sovereignty,Fair trade,Experiential knowledge,Environmental resource management,Empowerment,Deskilling,Agroecology","Cristian Timmermann,Georges F.

Theory predicts that prey sharing a predator, such as a biological control agent, can indirectly reduce each other's density at equilibrium (apparent competition). From this premise, we (i) discuss the complexity of indirect interactions among pests in agroecosystems and highlight the importance of natural enemy-mediated indirect interactions other than apparent competition, (ii) outline factors that affect the nature of enemy-mediated indirect interactions in the field and (iii) identify the way to manipulate enemy-mediated interactions for biological control. We argue that there is a need to increase the link between community ecology theory and biological control to develop better agroecological methods of crop protection via conservation biological control.

A review,2017-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-017-0472-4,"There is ongoing debate among stakeholders about the future development of agricultural and food systems to meet the global challenges of food supply, biological and cultural diversity, climate change, and social justice. Among other options, agroecology and organic agriculture are discussed. Both have similar goals and use a systems approach; however, they are recognised and received differently by stakeholders. Here we review and compare principles and practices defined and described in EU organic agriculture regulations, International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movement (IFOAM) norms, and agroecology scientific literature. The main finding are as follows: (1) Regarding principles, EU organic regulations mainly focus on appropriate design and management of biological processes based on ecological systems, restriction of external inputs, and strict limitation of chemical inputs. IFOAM principles are very broad and more complete, and include a holistic and systemic vision of sustainability. Agroecology has a defined set of principles for the ecological management of agri-food systems, which also includes some socio-economic principles. (2) Many proposed cropping practices are similar for EU organic, IFOAM, and agroecology, e.g. soil tillage, soil fertility and fertilisation, crop and cultivar choice, crop rotation, as well as pest, disease and weed management. In contrast, the origin and quantity of products potentially used for soil fertilisation and pest, disease, and weed management are different. Additionally, some practices are only mentioned for one of the three sources. (3) In animal production, only a few proposed practices are similar for EU organic, IFOAM, and agroecology. These include integration of cropping and animal systems and breed choice. In contrast, practices for animal management, prevention methods in animal health, animal housing, animal welfare, animal nutrition, and veterinary management are defined or described differently. (4) Related to food systems, organic agriculture focusses on technical aspects, such as food processing, while in agroecology there is a prominent debate between a transformative and conformative agenda. Both agroecology and organic agriculture offer promising contributions for the future development of sustainable agricultural production and food systems, especially if their principles and practices converge to a transformative approach and that impedes the conventionalisation of agro-food systems.","Sustainable development,Sustainability,Organic farming,Food systems,Environmental planning,Ecological systems theory,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural economics,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Food systems,Social movement,Peasant,Grassroots,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Population,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Sustainability,Valuation (finance),Sociology,Food systems,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Whole food,Sustainable agriculture,Social science","Paola Migliorini,Alexander Wezel,Miguel A.

882,Intraspecific trait variation across multiple scales: the leaf economics spectrum in coffee,2017-01-01,Functional Ecology,10.1111/1365-2435.12790,"Understanding species differences in plant functional traits has been critical in developing a mechanistic understanding of terrestrial ecological processes. Greater attention is now being placed on understanding the extent, causes and consequences of intraspecific trait variation (ITV). ITV is especially important in governing ecological processes in cropping systems, where only a small number of species or genotypes exist in high abundances. However, it remains unclear if key principles of trait-based ecology – namely the leaf economics spectrum (LES) – also describe intraspecific variation in crop functional biology. There also remains a need to understand whether ITV within crops is random, or structured across environmental, management-related or biological levels of organization in agroecosystems. We employed a nested design field survey to evaluate ITV in leaf traits in coffee (Coffea arabica), one of the world's most widespread tropical crops. We evaluated ITV in eight physiological, morphological and chemical leaf traits, across five nested categorical levels (sites, management systems, spatial location, plant identity, branch identity). We compared patterns of LES trait covariation in coffee, to interspecific patterns observed across over 700 wild plant species. Patterns of bivariate and multivariate ITV in coffee were broadly consistent with, but considerably weaker than, interspecific patterns associated with the LES, indicating that crops may systematically diverge from global patterns of trait trade-offs observed in wild plants. Physiological traits varied most widely (coefficient of variation (cv) 42–107%), followed by morphological traits (cv = 15–38%) and chemical traits (cv = 3–11%). Physiological ITV was best explained by the site in which a coffee plant was growing (17–55% explained), while ITV for chemical traits was best explained by management treatments within sites (25–36%); morphological ITV was higher even at the individual tree level or branch level and remained largely unexplained. Our results support the hypothesis that artificial selection and high-resource agricultural environments lead crops to systematically deviate from patterns of leaf trait covariation observed across wild plants species. Coupled with an understanding of how different traits vary systematically across multiple levels of biological organization, these findings help integrate ITV into future analyses of agroecosystem structure and function.

Applied agroecological research and the development of regional and community food systems are key means through which pressing ecological and social externalities may be mitigated. However, progress in both of these areas has been limited, particularly in the USA, with constraints in each likely holding the other back. In this article, we first review and explore how public investment in agroecology research and development has been limited in the USA. We then discuss how agricultural research funds could be shifted to better support the development of more resilient and equitable food systems. Finally, we explore a broader set of structural obstacles to food system change and identify key policies that could work jointly to strengthen a positive feedback cycle of research, policy, education and practic...","Sustainable agriculture,Public investment,Psychological resilience,Food systems,Externality,Ecosystem services,Economics,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Underpinning,Planetary boundaries,Planet,Water pollution,Surface runoff,Ocean deoxygenation,Sociology,Public policy,Politics of the United States,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Land grabbing,Food security,Ecosystem services,Water resources,Greenhouse gas,Ecosystem services,Public health law,Politics,Political science,Terrestrial ecosystem,Sustainable yield,Soil biodiversity,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Geography","Albie Miles,Marcia S.

884,Farming in the West African Sudan Savanna: Insights in the context of climate change,2013-01-01,African Journal of Agricultural Research,10.5897/AJAR2013.7153,"Farming is the main livelihood activity in semi-arid rural West Africa, involving the largest portion of the population, contributing significantly to the regional economy and intimately intertwined with current environmental problems. Key vulnerabilities of the Sudan Savanna include its ecological fragility, institutional weakness, high levels of poverty and food insecurity, and political and economic instability, now aggravated by climate change. The characterization of current farming and cropping systems in the Sudan Savanna is the key for understanding and proposing meaningful adaptation strategies at the field, farm, local and national levels. This review begins by examining the agroecological (biophysical) profile, detailing climatic, edaphological and hydrological qualities. Next, the main socioeconomic features: demography, culture, and organizational and economic institutions are summarized, followed by a characterization of the main farming and cropping systems and associated management. The paper concludes by offering an outlook on targeted activities, interventions and strategies for cropping and farming systems to cope and adapt to climate change and variability, as well as soil fertility challenges within the current socio-ecological context.","Poverty,Population,Livelihood,Environmental protection,Environmental planning,Ecological farming,Cropping,Climate change,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Lysimeter,Irrigation management,Evapotranspiration,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Environmental health,Economic growth,Sustainability,Poverty,Population growth,Sustainable development,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Sustainability,Tithonia,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil governance,Sustainability,Small farm,Rural area,Vulnerability,Psychological resilience,Political economy of climate change,Vulnerability,Political economy of climate change,Food security,Sub saharan,Physics,Natural resource economics,Soil management,Population,Mulch","Daniel Callo-Concha,Thomas Gaiser,Heidi Webber,Bernhard Tischbein,Marc Müller,Frank Ewert,Richard G.

These outbreaks have caused significant hardship to coffee producers and laborers. This essay situates the Big Rust in a broader historical context. Over the past two centuries, coffee farmers have had to deal with the ""curse of the Red Queen""-the need to constantly innovate in the face of an increasing range of threats, which includes the rust. Over the 20th century, particularly after World War II, national governments and international organizations developed a network of national, regional, and international coffee research institutions. These public institutions played a vital role in helping coffee farmers manage the rust. Coffee farmers have pursued four major strategies for managing the rust: bioprospecting for resistant coffee plants, breeding resistant coffee plants, chemical control, and agroecological control. Currently, the main challenge for researchers is to develop rust control strategies that are both ecologically and economically viable for coffee farmers, in the context of a volatile, deregulated coffee industry and the emergent challenges of climate change.","World War II,Rust,Public institution,Hemileia vastatrix,Curse,Coffea,Botany,Bioprospecting,Biology,Agroecology,Vulnerability,Socioeconomics,Profitability index,Threatened species,Taxonomy (biology),Taxonomic database,Vulnerability,Sociology,Social science,Weed,Tying,Red queen,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Ecosystem valuation,Witch,Prologue,Jazz,Plant disease,Fungicide,Disease control,Socioeconomics,Social relation,Restructuring,Soil pH,Soil acidification,Rust,Plant ecology,Pest control,Integrated pest management","Stuart McCook,John Vandermeer,Jacques Avelino,Marco Cristancho,Selena Georgiou,Pablo A.

Answering many of the critical questions in conservation, development and environmental management requires integrating the social and natural sciences. However, understanding the array of available quantitative methods and their associated terminology presents a major barrier to successful collaboration. 2. We provide an overview of quantitative socio-economic methods that distils their complexity into a simple taxonomy. We outline how each has been used in conjunction with ecological models to address questions relating to the management of socio-ecological systems. 3. We review the application of social and ecological quantitative concepts to agro-ecology and classify the approaches used to integrate the two disciplines. Our review included all published integrated models from 2003 to 2008 in 27 journals that publish agricultural modelling research. Although our focus is on agro-ecology, many of the results are broadly applicable to other fields involving an interaction between human activities and ecology. 4. We found 36 papers that integrated social and ecological concepts in a quantitative model. Four different approaches to integration were used, depending on the scale at which human welfare was quantified. Most models viewed humans as pure profit maximizers, both when calculating welfare and predicting behaviour. 5. Synthesis and applications. We reached two main conclusions based on our taxonomy and review. The first is that quantitative methods that extend predictions of behaviour and measurements of welfare beyond a simple market value basis are underutilized by integrated models. The second is that the accuracy of prediction for integrated models remains largely unquantified. Addressing both problems requires researchers to reach a common understanding of modelling goals and data requirements during the early stages of a project.","Welfare,Terminology,Social ecological model,Quantitative model,Publication,Market value,Human welfare,Ecology,Biology,Agroecology,Stern Review,Stern,Political economy of climate change,Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology,Theory of reasoned action,Theory of planned behavior,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Geography,Environmental resource management,Theory of planned behavior,Psychology,Management science,Theory of reasoned action,Theory of planned behavior,Technology acceptance model,Quarter century,Multiple-criteria decision analysis,Multiple criteria,Multiple-criteria decision analysis,Machine learning,Evidential reasoning approach,Weighted product model,VIKOR method,R-CAST,Mathematics,Heuristics,Econometrics","Ira R.

Authors of articles published in psychology, behavioural neuroscience, and medical journals were asked, via email, to interpret two fictitious studies that found similar results, one statistically significant, and the other non-significant. Responses from 330 authors varied greatly, but interpretation was generally poor, whether results were presented as CIs or using NHST. However, when interpreting CIs respondents who mentioned NHST were 60% likely to conclude, unjustifiably, the two results conflicted, whereas those who interpreted CIs without reference to NHST were 95% likely to conclude, justifiably, the two results were consistent. Findings were generally similar for all three disciplines. An email survey of academic psychologists confirmed that CIs elicit better interpretations if NHST is not invoked.

The Sahel is a major global agroecological region and its success in adaptation will influence the achievement of the global Millennium Development Goals. From simple typologies of adaptation strategies, our understanding of adaptive capacity has evolved over time (with accumulating observations) into a contextual model which places drought management at the center of a development process. Climate change impacts in future are very uncertain. Policies and interventions should therefore aim to build on the platform of past achievements and existing local knowledge to enable flexibility and diversity and the protection of assets of small-scale farmers and herders.

This impact was evaluated by analyzing species richness, vegetation structure, carbon sequestration and above ground biomass. We hypothesize that: (a) plant (tree and herbs) species richness is negatively correlated to management intensity and (b) vegetational density predictably change with management intensity. Our results show that management as practiced in traditional cocoa forest gardens in southern Cameroon following a gradient of intensification from extensive cocoa forest gardens with high floristic diversity to intensive ones strongly impacts plant diversity, plant biomass and to some extend carbon storage with possible negative consequences on biodiversity. Great differences in species richness, species composition, and, for trees, diameter at breast height and basal area were evident among the five types of traditional cocoa forest garden systems investigated. In terms of plant species richness, we found a decreasing gradient of plant species numbers from extensive forest gardens to intensive ones. This study also highlights the importance of the Management Index for quantifying differences in the management; this index could be used to standardize certification procedures and assess conservation progress and success. Our findings support the idea that traditional cocoa forest gardens can help to protect many forest species, sustains smallholder production and offer more scope for conservation of biodiversity, at both species-level and landscape-level. Moreover, diverse traditional cocoa forest gardens may help in regulating pests and diseases and allow for efficient adaptation to changing socioeconomic conditions.","Vegetation,Species richness,Forest management,Forest gardening,Floristics,Ecology,Biology,Biodiversity,Basal area,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Structural diversity,Species diversity,Species discovery curve,Tropics,Resource management,Landscape ecology,Tropical rainforest,Species richness,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Understory,Taxonomic rank,Species richness,Species richness,Price premium,Latin Americans,Sustainability,Predation,Ecosystem services,Tree species,Resource use,Population density,Natural resource management,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Predation,PEST analysis,Insectivore,Mathematics,Mathematical theory,Management science","D B Bisseleua Hervé,Stefan Vidal,Anne E.

These principles can be applied using various practices and strategies, each having different effects on productivity, stability and resiliency of the target farming system. By breaking the monoculture nature of farming systems, agroecological diversification aims at mimicking ecological processes leading to optimal nutrient cycling and organic matter turnover, soil biological activation, closed energy flows, water and soil conservation and balanced pest-natural enemy populations. All these processes are key maintaining the agroecosystem’s health, productivity and its self-sustaining capacity. By enhancing functional biodiversity, a major goal of the conversion process is achieved: strengthening the weak ecological functions in the agroecosystem, allowing farmers to gradually eliminate inputs altogether by relying instead on ecological processes and interactions.","Sustainability,Soil conservation,Monoculture,Ecology,Ecological farming,Biology,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Agroecological restoration,Agriculture,Agricultural engineering,Socio-ecological system,Social network,Social learning,Organic farming,Business,Agroforestry,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Soil organic matter,Organic farming,No-till farming,Zero Budget Farming,Natural farming,Mixed farming,Sustainable agriculture,Soil fertility,Soil conservation,Sustainable development,Resource management,Natural resource management,Water conservation,Population,Biology,Intercropping,Geography,Facilitation,Vicia faba,Rhizosphere,Phosphorus","Nicholls Ci,Altieri Ma,Vazquez L,Carl Folke,Minou Yussefi-Menzler,Paul Maeder,David Pimentel,Paul Hepperly,James Hanson,David Douds,Rita Seidel,Claire Kremen,Albie Miles,Anastasios Lithourgidis,Christos Dordas,C.

In North American agroforestry, however, little emphasis has been placed on production capacity of the woody plants themselves, taking into account their ability to transform portions of the landscape from annual monoculture systems to diversified perennial systems capable of producing fruits, nuts, and timber products. In this paper, we introduce the concept of multifunctional woody polycultures (MWPs) and consider the design of long-term experimental trials for supporting research on agroforestry emphasizing tree crops. Critical aspects of long-term agroforestry experiments are summarized, and two existing well-documented research sites are presented as case studies. A new long-term agroforestry trial at the University of Illinois, “Agroforestry for Food,” is introduced as an experiment designed to test the performance of increasingly complex woody plant combinations in an alley cropping system with productive tree crops. This trial intends to address important themes of food security, climate change, multifunctionality, and applied solutions.

VRC01-class bnAbs that target the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) of trimeric HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein spikes are particularly attractive to elicit because of their extraordinary breadth and potency of neutralization in vitro and their ability to protect against infection in animal models. Glycans bordering the CD4bs impede the binding of germline-reverted forms of VRC01-class bnAbs and therefore constitute a barrier to early events in initiating the correct antibody lineages. Deleting a subset of these glycans permits Env antigen binding but not virus neutralization, suggesting that additional barriers impede germline-reverted VRC01-class antibody binding to functional Env trimers. We investigated the requirements for functional Env trimer engagement of VRC01-class naive B cell receptors by using virus neutralization and germline-reverted antibodies as surrogates for the interaction. Targeted deletion of a subset of N-glycans bordering the CD4bs, combined with Man5 enrichment of remaining N-linked glycans that are otherwise processed into larger complex-type glycans, rendered HIV-1 426c Env-pseudotyped virus (subtype C, transmitted/founder) highly susceptible to neutralization by near germline forms of VRC01-class bnAbs. Neither glycan modification alone rendered the virus susceptible to neutralization. The potency of neutralization in some cases rivaled the potency of mature VRC01 against wildtype viruses.

Taking as a paradigm the holistic scientific approach fostered by agroecology, we present a methodological proposal for the implementation of participatory action research in rural areas. Our aims were various: to solve a specific problem, i.e. the exclusion of small- and medium-scale organic farmers from the official certification system; to find solutions collectively through an exchange of knowledge between researchers, technicians, producers and consumers; and to generate endogenous social change in rural areas through processes based on local skills and collective creativity. This paper examines the methods applied, and provides a participatory reflexive analysis of those methods. Both the keys to the success and the constraints are analysed, in order to conclude the contributions that agroecology and PAR processes can make to sustainable and innovative research proposals.","Sociology,Socioeconomics,Social change,Reflexivity,Participatory action research,Participatory GIS,Environmental resource management,Citizen journalism,Certification,Agroecology,Action research,Sustainability,Statistics,Principles of Organic Agriculture,Third world,Socioeconomics,Economics,Sociology,Language/action perspective,Ideal speech situation,Sociology,Social science education,Social science,Sustainable development,Rural sociology,Politics,Sociology,Sociological theory of diffusion,Product innovation,Third world,Problematization,Poverty,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Standard of living,Socialism,Poverty,Trustworthiness,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability","Mamen Cuéllar-Padilla,Ángel Calle-Collado,Helga Willer,Minou Yussefi,Amarjit Sahota,Beate Huber,Susan Greenhalgh,Arturo Escobar,Jürgen Habermas,Thomas McCarthy,Silvio O.

For example, permits have different validities across time (e.g., banking, borrowing, and seasons) and space (e.g., zonal restrictions), and compliance timing can be annual, in overlapping cycles, or in multi-year periods. We discuss nine prominent cap and trade programs along these dimensions and construct a general model of permit validity and compliance timing. We derive sufficient conditions under which abatement is invariant to compliance timing, i.e., compliance timing cannot smooth abatement cost shocks. Under these conditions, (i) expected compliance costs are invariant, (ii) the variance of compliance costs increases with the delayed compliance, (iii) equilibrium prices may not be unique, and (iv) the delayed compliance equilibrium may rely on “degenerate” prices not determined by marginal abatement costs. We demonstrate the model's broad applicability by illustrating different types of temporal permit validity.","Welfare economics,Microeconomics,Invariant (mathematics),Emissions trading,Economics,Sustainable energy,Primary energy,Parliament,Welfare,Water pollution,Pollution,Single market,International economics,European union,Normative,Natural resource economics,Finance,Public economics,Political history,Legislation,Political economy,Natural disaster,Launched,Member state,Kyoto Protocol,International trade,Suite,Public economics,Natural disaster,Restructuring,Microeconomics,Environmental compliance,Sulfur dioxide,Strategic bidding,Pollution","Stepehen P.

A field study was initiated in 1986 with zero-, minimum-, and conventional-tillage systems. In 1989 and 1990, the fourth and fifth years of study, weed community diversity and relative composition were assessed prior to and following the application of post-emergence non-residual herbicides. Weed communities were assessed at the level of tillage system to balance the effect of different crop sequences and crop-herbicide combinations within each comparison. In general, herbicides did not reduce community diversity when compared by Shannon's H’and dominance-diversity curves. An increase in species richness and evenness, as assessed by Shannon's E and Margalef's DMG occurred in some cases. Differences in relative community composition among tillage systems were apparent before the application of herbicides, but disappeared following herbicide application. The use of herbicides in this study reduced weed densities, maintained weed diversity, and inhibited community changes that were due to changing tillage systems.","Weed,Tillage,Species richness,Species evenness,Species diversity,Hordeum vulgare,Botany,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroecology,Species richness,Species diversity,Spatial ecology,Weed,Tillage,Biology,Vegetation,National park,Long period,Weed,Summary data,Successive sampling,Weed,Tillage,Summer fallow,Weed,Setaria viridis,Secale,Forestry,Biology,Agronomy,Tillage,No-till farming,Mulch-till,Water pollution,Wader,Intertidal zone,Tillage,Soil tillage,No-till farming","D.

One effort to meet this challenge has been organic farming, with outcomes that are generally positive. However, a number of challenges remain. Organic yields lag behind those in conventional agriculture, and greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient leaching remain somewhat problematic. In this paper, we examine current organic and conventional agriculture systems and suggest that agroforestry, which is the intentional combination of trees and shrubs with crops or livestock, could be the next step in sustainable agriculture. By implementing systems that mimic nature’s functions, agroforestry has the potential to remain productive while supporting a range of ecosystem services. In this paper, we outline the common practices and products of agroforestry as well as beneficial environmental and social effects. We address barriers to agroforestry and explore potential options to alter policies and increase adoption by farmers. We conclude that agroforestry is one of the best land use strategies to contribute to food security while simultaneously limiting environmental degradation.","Sustainable agriculture,Organic farming,Land use,Food security,Environmental degradation,Ecosystem services,Economics,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Soil science,Population,Organic farming,Sustainability,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Soil organic matter,Organic farming,No-till farming,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Species richness,Pest control,PEST analysis,Sustainability,Soil quality,Poverty,Soil carbon,Radiative forcing,Methane,Soil science,Soil production function,Soil governance,Population density,Population,Invertebrate","Matthew Heron Wilson,Sarah Taylor Lovell,Paul Maeder,Verena Seufert,Navin Ramankutty,Jonathan A.

Environmental pressures on plants (wind, dust, drought, water, temperature) vary by geography and characterizing the impact of these variable pressures on phyllosphere microbiota will contribute to improved stewardship of fresh produce for both plant and human health. A higher resolution understanding of the incidence of human pathogens on food plants and co-occurring phytobiota using metagenomic approaches (metagenome tracking) may contribute to improved source attribution and risk assessment in cases where human pathogens become introduced to agro-ecologies. Between 1990 and 2007, as many as 1990 culture-confirmed Salmonella illnesses were linked to tomatoes from as many as 12 multistate outbreaks (Bell et al., 2012; Bell et al., 2015; Bennett et al., 2014; CDC, 2004; CDC, 2007; Greene et al., 2005a; Gruszynski et al., 2014). When possible, source attribution for these incidents revealed a biogeographic trend, most events were associated with eastern growing regions. To improve our understanding of potential biogeographically linked trends in contamination of tomatoes by Salmonella , we profiled microbiota from the surfaces of tomatoes from Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and California. Bacterial profiles from California tomatoes were completely different than those of Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina (which were highly similar to each other). A statistically significant enrichment of Firmicutes taxa was observed in California phytobiota compared to the three eastern states. Rhizobiaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae and Xanthobacteraceae were the most abundant bacterial families associated with tomatoes grown in eastern states. These baseline metagenomic profiles of phyllosphere microbiota may contribute to improved understanding of how certain ecologies provide supportive resources for human pathogens on plants and how components of certain agro-ecologies may play a role in the introduction of human pathogens to plants.","Taxon,Phyllosphere,Outbreak,Microbiology,Metagenomics,Food safety,Firmicutes,Ecology,Biology,Biogeography,Agroecology,mothur,Throughput,Sequencing data,UniFrac,Supplementary data,Sequence clustering,UniFrac,Ribosomal RNA,Operational taxonomic unit,mothur,UniFrac,Tenericutes,Throughput,Illumina dye sequencing,Genetics,User interface,Software portability,Software,k-nearest neighbors algorithm,Speedup,Pairwise comparison,Whole genome sequencing,Sequence analysis,Nucleic acid sequence,Virology,Subtyping,Salmonella,Woody plant,Species diversity,Phylogenetics","Andrea Ottesen,Padmini Ramachandran,Elizabeth Reed,Ganyu Gu,Sasha Gorham,Diane Ducharme,Michael Newell,Steven Rideout,Thomas Turini,Thomas Hill,Errol Strain,Eric Brown,J Gregory Caporaso,Justin Kuczynski,Jesse Stombaugh,Kyle Bittinger,Frederic D Bushman,Robert C.

907,The intersection of food security and biodiversity conservation: a review,2017-01-01,Regional Environmental Change,10.1007/S10113-015-0873-3,"Food security and biodiversity conservation are key challenges of the twenty-first century. While traditionally these two challenges were addressed separately, recently, papers have begun to specifically address the nexus of food security and biodiversity conservation. We conducted a structured literature review of 91 papers addressing this nexus. To ascertain how a given paper approached the topic, we assessed to what extent it covered 68 potentially relevant issues. The resulting dataset was analyzed using cluster analysis. Two main branches of literature, containing a total of six clusters of papers, were identified. The “biophysical-technical” branch (clusters: “sustainable intensification” and “production focus”) was dominated by the natural sciences, focused strongly on the production aspect of food security, and sought general solutions. In contrast, the “social-political” branch (clusters: “social-ecological development”; “empowerment for food security”; “agroecology and food sovereignty”; and “social-ecological systems”) often drew on the social sciences and emphasized social relations and governance, alongside broader considerations of sustainability and human well-being. While the biophysical-technical branch was often global in focus, much of the social-political branch focused on specific localities. Two clusters of papers, one from each branch, stood out as being particularly broad in scope—namely the clusters on “sustainable intensification” and “agroecology and food sovereignty.” Despite major differences in their conceptual basis, we argue that exchange between these two research clusters could be particularly helpful in generating insights on the food–biodiversity nexus that are both generally applicable and sufficiently nuanced to capture key system-specific variables.","Sustainability,Social relation,Nexus (standard),Food sovereignty,Food security,Environmental resource management,Empowerment,Economics,Corporate governance,Agroecology,Software engineering,Software analytics,Reference software,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Sustainable development,Poverty,Food security,Summit,Population,Nationality,Statistics,Ridge,Response surface methodology,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Greenhouse gas,Food systems,Land grabbing,Food security,Ecosystem services,Tropics,Habitat destruction,Ecology","Josefine Glamann,Jan Hanspach,David J.

908,Intraspecific leaf economic trait variation partially explains coffee performance across agroforestry management regimes,2015-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2014.11.014,"The leaf economics spectrum (LES) refers to a suite of correlated leaf-level physiological, morphological, and chemical traits that can be used to describe life-history strategy among plant species. Documenting LES trait variation across environmental gradients has been important for understanding natural plant community dynamics in response to environmental change. However few studies have examined how LES traits covary within crops, or how the LES is correlated with farm-level management practices or goals, especially for important tree-crops such as coffee. We analyzed within-species variation in eight leaf traits in 60 Coffea arabica plants, across four management treatments differing in shade-tree species composition, to test (i) if hypothesized LES patterns also describe within-species trait variation, and (ii) if LES traits vary in response to management regimes, or are correlated with reproductive output. Leaf traits varied widely across coffee plants with photosynthetic rates (Amass) and leaf area showing especially high variation. In bivariate and multivariate analyses, coffee leaf traits covaried in patterns consistent with the LES, suggesting shifts between leaf-level resource acquisition and conservation traits among plants may also underpin coffee responses to agroforestry management. The position of a coffee plant along the LES (as described by a principal component analysis score) was best explained by light availability, but did not vary systematically with shade tree composition. LES traits were weakly but significantly related to plant-level reproductive output: coffee plants associated with lower Amass and leaf N values, and higher leaf mass per area were associated with greater reproductive output. In showing that the LES describes resource capture and/or conservation strategies among coffee plants, our study represents a novel adoption of the LES to address applied questions in managed systems. Since within species differences in leaf traits partially explain differences in coffee yield, we also suggest that trait-based research in agroecology can contribute to an applied and comprehensive understanding of crop functional biology, and ultimately, agroecosystem structure and function.","Trait,Shade tree,Plant community,Intraspecific competition,Environmental change,Ecology,Coffea arabica,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Visualization,Public domain,Pixel,Vegetation,Trait,Specific leaf area,Trophic level,Trait,Plant species,Tree species,Taxon,Secondary chemistry,Vegetation,Trait,Species richness,Type I and type II errors,Statistics,Regression analysis,Trait,Terminology,Plant traits,Sustainability,Soil quality,Poverty,Trait,Storage effect,Species diversity,Terrestrial ecosystem,Reactive nitrogen,Nitrogen cycle","Stephanie Gagliardi,Adam R.

909,Doubled-up legume rotations improve soil fertility and maintain productivity under variable conditions in maize-based cropping systems in Malawi,2016-01-01,Agricultural Systems,10.1016/J.AGSY.2016.03.008,"Smallholder farmers in Malawi must cope with small farm size, low soil fertility and production risks associated with rainfed agriculture. Integration of legumes into maize-based cropping systems is advocated as a means to increase production of diverse nutrient-dense grains and improve soil fertility. It is difficult to achieve both aims simultaneously, however. Short-duration grain legumes rarely produce enough biomass to appreciatively improve soils, and long duration pigeonpea, commonly grown in Malawi as a dual purpose crop, produces little or no edible grain as a consequence of grain-filling into the dry season. A novel technology is the doubled-up legume rotation (DLR) system in which two legumes with complementary phenology are intercropped and grown in rotation with maize. Initial performance from on-farm research is favorable; however, it is crucial to understand competition for resources in mixed cropping systems under variable soil and climate conditions. We used soil and crop yield data from farmer participatory trials to parameterize the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and evaluate its performance in simulating observed treatments at three locations in central Malawi. We used the calibrated APSIM model to investigate the performance of DLR and other maize-based systems across 26 growing seasons (1979–2005) in the three agroecologies. We simulated two DLR systems (maize rotated with a groundnut/pigeonpea or soybean/pigeonpea intercrop), maize rotated with groundnut or soybean, maize intercropped with pigeonpea, and continuous maize under a range of N fertilizer inputs. We extended findings to the household level by determining calorie and protein yields of these systems, and calculating the chance that an average household could meet their food requirements by dedicating all available farmland to a given system. Simulated maize grain yields in DLR and maize-grain legume rotations were essentially equivalent, and exceeded yields in maize/pigeonpea intercrop and sole cropped maize receiving comparable fertility inputs. All rotation systems were more likely to meet household calorie and protein needs than other systems receiving equivalent inputs. DLR systems accumulated higher total soil C and N over time than traditional rotation systems in areas where pigeonpea performed well. However, the effects of improved soil fertility on maize yields were counterbalanced by factors including N immobilization and water availability. We conclude that where growing conditions allow, DLR can harness the complementary phenology of pigeonpea to build soil quality for the future without reducing maize yields or compromising household food production in the immediate term.","Soil quality,Soil fertility,Rainfed agriculture,Growing season,Economics,Cropping,Crop yield,Crop,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Sea ice,Satellite,Physics,Seasonal forecasting,Predictability,Operational forecasting,Water balance,Systems design,Supply chain,Population,Operations research,Expert consultation,Watershed,Topographic map,Terrain,Sustainable agriculture,Literature survey,Ecosystem services,Sustainable agriculture,Monoculture,Green Revolution,Sub saharan,Physics,Natural resource economics,Ion exchange,Inorganic chemistry,Chemistry,Tillage,Striga,Mulch","Alex Smith,Sieglinde Snapp,John Dimes,Chiwimbo Gwenambira,Regis Chikowo,Suranjana Saha,Shrinivas Moorthi,Hua-Lu Pan,Xingren Wu,Jiande Wang,Suranjana Saha,Shrinivas Moorthi,Xingren Wu,Jiande Wang,Sudhir Nadiga,B.

910,Structuring Markets for Resilient Farming Systems,2019-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-019-0572-4,"Diversified farms have received considerable attention for their potential to contribute to environmentally sustainable, resilient, and socially just food systems. In response, some governments are building new forms of public support for social-ecological services through the creation of mediated markets, such as targeted public food procurement programs. Here, we examine the relationship between farmer participation in Brazil’s National School Feeding Program and farm diversification and household autonomy, as key indicators of farm household resilience. We hypothesized that two key features of the food procurement program—structured demand for diversified food products, and a price premium for certified organic and agroecological production—would increase farm-level agrobiodiversity and the use of agroecological practices. We designed a comparative study between family farmers who do, and do not, participate in Brazil’s National School Feeding Program in the plateau region of Santa Catarina in Southern Brazil. We used semi-structured surveys to collect data on farm agrobiodiversity, management practices, and farm household autonomy, and we conducted land use history assessments. Here, we suggest for the first time that the National School Feeding Program played a role in driving the following: (1) transitions on family farms from low agrobiodiversity, input-intensive farming systems to diversified farming systems (i.e., horticultural production) and (2) a significant increase in the cropped area under diversified farming systems. This transition was supported by making horticultural production an economically viable alternative to field crops typically linked to volatile, unpredictable markets. The convergence of public policies supporting mediated markets, increased farm household autonomy, and farm diversification represents an integrated mechanism with the potential to enhance food system resilience.","Sustainable development,Procurement,Price premium,Food systems,Diversification (marketing strategy),Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Agricultural biodiversity,Water resources,Greenhouse gas,Ecosystem services,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource,Sustainable development,Rural sociology,Politics,Species richness,Per capita,Geography,Socioeconomics,Population,Market access,Zero Budget Farming,Natural farming,Mixed farming,Warning system,Validation Studies as Topic,Terminology,Standard of living,Species richness,Species evenness,Tree diversity,Software,Geography,Standardization,Socioeconomic status,Reference Period","Vivian Valencia,Hannah Wittman,Jennifer Blesh,Alison G.

911,Natural living—a precondition for animal welfare in organic farming,2006-01-01,Livestock Science,10.1016/J.LIVPRODSCI.2005.08.005,"Abstract This article discusses animal welfare in organic farming systems in relation to values and aims in organic farming. It sums up experiences from a 4-year interdisciplinary project. An important finding is that animal welfare is understood somewhat differently in organic farming from what is common in conventional agriculture. It is interpreted in terms of natural living, which includes the possibility to perform a natural behaviour, feed adapted to the animal's physiology and a natural environment. Some of the criticism of animal welfare in organic farming may stem from different understandings of what “welfare” actually means. However, although welfare is an important aim in organic farming, the overall concern is to develop sustainable farming systems. This causes some welfare dilemmas. For example, a healthy system does not automatically mean good welfare for the individual. Based on available literature the actual welfare situation in organic systems was scrutinized. Unfortunately little research has been done, but a careful conclusion was that animal health is as good or better than in conventional farming—with the exception of parasitic diseases. Organic farming systems have a “welfare potential”, but organic farmers must deal with the dilemmas and take animal welfare issues seriously.","Welfare,Sustainable agriculture,Organic farming,Natural resource economics,Integrated production,Integrated farming,Biology,Biochemistry,Animal welfare,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Welfare,Quality assurance,Organic farming,Welfare,Social psychology,Meat packing industry,Welfare,Public health,Organic farming,Human ecology,Geography,Environmental ethics,Veterinary medicine,Raillietina cesticillus,Heterakis gallinarum,Welfare,Stereotypy (non-human),MEDLINE,Qualitative interviews,Organic farming,Normative,Virology,Veterinary parasitology,Redress,Zoology,Veterinary medicine,Skin damage,Stocking,Pasture,Organic farming","Vonne Lund,Albert Sundrum,Hein Te Velde,Noelle Aarts,Cees Van Woerkum,M Hovi,A Sundrum,S.M Thamsborg,Arne Næss,A.

912,Action versus Result-Oriented Schemes in a Grassland Agroecosystem: A Dynamic Modelling Approach,2012-01-01,PLOS ONE,10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0033257,"Effects of agri-environment schemes (AES) on biodiversity remain controversial. While most AES are action-oriented, result-oriented and habitat-oriented schemes have recently been proposed as a solution to improve AES efficiency. The objective of this study was to compare action-oriented, habitat-oriented and result-oriented schemes in terms of ecological and productive performance as well as in terms of management flexibility. We developed a dynamic modelling approach based on the viable control framework to carry out a long term assessment of the three schemes in a grassland agroecosystem. The model explicitly links grazed grassland dynamics to bird population dynamics. It is applied to lapwing conservation in wet grasslands in France. We ran the model to assess the three AES scenarios. The model revealed the grazing strategies respecting ecological and productive constraints specific to each scheme. Grazing strategies were assessed by both their ecological and productive performance. The viable control approach made it possible to obtain the whole set of viable grazing strategies and therefore to quantify the management flexibility of the grassland agroecosystem. Our results showed that habitat and result-oriented scenarios led to much higher ecological performance than the action-oriented one. Differences in both ecological and productive performance between the habitat and result-oriented scenarios were limited. Flexibility of the grassland agroecosystem in the result-oriented scenario was much higher than in that of habitat-oriented scenario. Our model confirms the higher flexibility as well as the better ecological and productive performance of result-oriented schemes. A larger use of result-oriented schemes in conservation may also allow farmers to adapt their management to local conditions and to climatic variations.","Theoretical ecology,Population,Habitat,Grazing,Grassland,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem,Ecology,Biology,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Vegetation,Umbrella species,Measurement of biodiversity,Viability theory,Computer science,Biochemical engineering,Surprise,Structuring,Restructuring,Regional policy,Profit (economics),Landscape assessment,Wildlife,Urban sprawl,Population,Temporal scales,Sustainability,Stock (geology),Transaction cost,Pillar,Intrinsic motivation,Water efficiency,Water conservation,Sustainable management,Wader,Vanellus,Tringa,Zoology,Vanellus,Sturnus","Rodolphe Sabatier,Luc Doyen,Muriel Tichit,David Kleijn,R.

The original model, in which members support a farming operation by paying for produce in advance and receive a share of the farm's produce in return, has been adapted, with much innovation. Since little research existed on CSAs in the Central Valley, we surveyed and carried out in-depth interviews with 54 CSA farmers and two CSA organizers in the Central Valley and surrounding foothills. Here we focus on four aspects of these CSA operations: type, economic viability, farmer characteristics and farm attributes. We found two main CSA models, box and membership/share. Fifty-four percent of the CSAs reported being profitable, and the average gross sales per acre were $9,084. CSA farmers are diverse in political orientation, yet are generally younger, better educated and more likely to be women than the general farming population. CSA farms are relatively small, with a median size of 20 acres; have a median membership of 60 (585 average); use agroecological methods; cultivate agrobiodiversity; and utilize growing practices that generally meet or exceed National Organic Program standards.","Thriving,Population,Foothills,Environmental protection,Direct marketing,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Agricultural biodiversity,A share,Socioeconomics,Social relation,Social engagement,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Good agricultural practice,Food systems,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Natural resource economics,Resource management,Environmental resource management,Environmental planning,Local economy,Local culture,Local adaptation,Geography,Economy,CONQUEST,Sociology,Social science,Social role,Slow growth,Regional science,Population,Organic farming,Natural resource,Geography","Ryan E.

914,Transdisciplinary Research for a Sustainable Agriculture and Food Sector,2008-01-01,Agronomy Journal,10.2134/AGRONJ2007.0073,"Research in agriculture has strongly focused on discipline-oriented, natural science-based approaches to increasing production with success measured by short-term, neoclassical economic evaluation. This strategy has contributed to impressive increases in food production over the last half century. Growing concerns include environmental impacts, changes in rural communities, and distribution of benefits of current agricultural systems. One major theme of this paper is a holistic, ecological, and transdisciplinary strategy for research in the agriculture and food sector, including attention to production and economics along with environmental and social factors. Agroecology provides an integrative alternative to the conventional division of research into specialized disciplines. The other primary theme is potential for a broader geographical approach to research, using the Nordic Region model as a case study for designing an educational platform to integrate research with teaching. We believe that students must develop a capacity to deal with future complexity and uncertainty, and thus be prepared to search out and answer difficult questions that have not yet been asked. In a university culture of curiosity and commitment, we need learning landscapes that prepare students to deal with change, embrace multiple dimensions of the food challenge, and establish participatory interactions with clients, communities, and organizations. In connecting scientists and consumers with the origins of their food and building awareness of the importance of the natural environment, we encourage wider support by society for research toward long-term sustainable agriculture and food supplies. We provide a working model of how to plan regional, transdisciplinary research to sustain agriculture and food systems.","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Interdisciplinarity,Food systems,Food processing,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural education","C.

The reduction of N2O into N2 by microorganisms carrying the nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ) is the only biological process known to eliminate this greenhouse gas. Recent studies showed that a previously unknown clade of N2O-reducers was related to the capacity of the soil to act as an N2O sink, opening the way for new strategies to mitigate emissions. Here, we investigated whether the agricultural practices could differently influence the two N2O reducer clades with consequences for denitrification end-products. The abundance of N2O-reducers and producers was quantified by real-time PCR, and the diversity of both nosZ clades was determined by 454 pyrosequencing. Potential N2O production and potential denitrification activity were used to calculate the denitrification gaseous end-product ratio. Overall, the results showed limited differences between management practices but there were significant differences between cropping systems in both the abundance and structure of the nosZII community, as well as in the [rN2O/r(N2O+N2)] ratio. More limited differences were observed in the nosZI community, suggesting that the newly identified nosZII clade is more sensitive than nosZI to environmental changes. Potential denitrification activity and potential N2O production were explained mainly by the soil properties while the diversity of the nosZII clade on its own explained 26% of the denitrification end-product ratio, which highlights the importance of understanding the ecology of this newly identified clade of N2O reducers for mitigation strategies.","Soil microbiology,Sink (computing),Nitrous-oxide reductase,Nitrogen cycle,Greenhouse gas,Ecology,Denitrification,Cropping system,Biology,Agroecology,mothur,UniFrac,Software,UniFrac,Supplementary data,Sequence clustering,Water resources,Sustainability and environmental management,Runaway climate change,genomic DNA,Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis,Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer analysis,Statistics,Sampling (statistics),Regression,User interface,Software portability,Software,Ozone layer,Ozone depletion,Ozone,Vector graphics,Tree of life,Phylogenetic tree,Respiratory nitrate reductase,Paracoccus denitrificans,Nitrous-oxide reductase,Type I and type II errors,Statistical hypothesis testing,Estimator","Luiz A.

917,"Ecological sustainability evaluation of traditional management in different vineyard systems in Berisso, Argentina",2007-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2006.08.001,"Abstract The ecological principles underlying traditional agricultural management practices are not always understood. On the coast of Berisso, Argentina, traditional management practices are applied to “old” vineyards located in flood plain areas, subject to periodic floods. Over the last few years, “new” vineyards have been planted at slightly higher altitudes, protecting them from river flooding. Despite the ecological differences between the low and high areas, farmers have largely extended traditional management practices to the new vineyards. This study was undertaken to evaluate the risks involved when traditional agricultural management practices are applied to different ecological settings while the underlying ecological principles of those practices are not well understood. The evaluation relies on three distinct sections: (1) assessing the sustainability of a traditional vineyard management system, (2) analyzing its underlying ecological principles and (3) investigating the potential consequences of applying management practices utilized in flood plain zones to higher altitudes. To carry out the evaluation, a methodology based on indicators was used. In particular, an evaluation was developed to examine traditional vineyard management effects on both internal resources, such as soil properties and biodiversity, and external resources, such as nonrenewable energy and water resources. In old vineyards situated within the flood plain, traditional management practices recycle organic matter, preserve biodiversity, provide for an efficient use of nonrenewable energy and ensure a low risk of underground water contamination from pesticides. Furthermore, the soil nutrient balance is maintained via nutrient input from river sediments. In contrast, new vineyards present a negative soil nutrient balance. Our findings thus suggest that traditional management practices are ecologically sound when considered within their original ecological context, but may be inappropriate in new ecological settings.","Water resources,Vineyard,Sustainability,Non-renewable resource,Management system,Floodplain,Environmental resource management,Ecology,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecology,World Reference Base for Soil Resources,Unified Soil Classification System,USDA soil taxonomy,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Sustainable development,Resource management,Natural resource management,Politics,Need to know,Measurement of biodiversity,Pepper,Nutrient,Greenhouse,Water quality,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Water flow,Land use,Environmental resource management,Sustainability,Soil quality,Organic farming,Water resources,Sustainability,Soil management,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Scientific method","Esteban A.

Non- chemical control methods can be preferable to prevent pest damage. One way to achieve this involves the establishment of ground cover or the restoration of vegetation adjacent to the crop. Either of these methods can effectively increase the abundance of natural enemies, particularly in perennial crops, but their interaction has been typically neglected. In this study we used maximum likelihood methods to analyse the synergistic effects of ground cover and different types of adjacent vegetation (herbaceous, woody) on the abundance of the main natural enemy groups of insect pests in olive groves. A Gaussian function was used to predict their abundance as a response of time, ground cover, different types of adjacent vegetation and year (2010, 2011). We examined 40 different alternative models for each group of natural enemies: spiders, ants, predatory Heteroptera, and parasitoids. Spiders, parasitoids, and one species of predatory Heteroptera (Deraeocoris punctum), showed a greater abundance in ground cover plots. Overall, herbaceous and large woody vegetation adjacent to the crop influenced the abundance of natural enemies more than small woody vegetation. However, this effect was modulated by ground cover. When both structures were present in the crop, the abundance of some groups of natural enemies (spider and parasitoids) was positively influenced by adjacent vegetation, whereas this effect was lower or even reversed in bare soil crops. We thus encourage olive farmers to use both habitat management approaches simultaneously, since the interaction of these ecological infrastructures produce an effect","Vegetation,Pesticide,PEST analysis,Herbaceous plant,Habitat,Ecology,Crop,Biology,Biological pest control,Agronomy,Agroecology","Daniel Paredes,Luis Cayuela,Mercedes Campos,R Core Team,Kenneth P.

Increasing efficiency of crop production is unlikely to be sufficient to meet the demand, presenting a long-term threat to humanity’s ‘well-being’. Knowledge of the system-level behaviour of agroecosystems, however, remains surprisingly limited, reflecting the agricultural focus on particular species. This is starting to change towards an ecosystem and network-based approach, following the recent revolution in thinking about resource use and sustainability in our other global food production industry: commercial fisheries. Agroecosystems appear to retain plasticity of ecological processes that might be manipulated for productivity and sustainability. Network structure and dynamics have substantial impacts on ecosystem performance, but evidence from agroecosystems lags behind network theory. Here, we provide an introduction to network theory and application in agroecosystems, identify network metrics for management and environmental change, and, finally, we highlight gaps in our current knowledge and key research themes.

Though cotton may potentially benefit from animal mediated pollination, it is unknown if the species is indeed pollen limited across agroecological landscapes. Our study had three objectives: (1) identify the land use attributes that impact wild pollinator abundance and diversity, (2) investigate the relationship between pollinator community composition and cotton pollen limitation and (3) determine the extent of direct and indirect effects of land use on pollinator community composition and pollination service. To address these objectives, we used a combination of pollinator community surveys, GIS analysis, and pollen limitation experiments across 12 cotton landscapes in South Texas. Overall, we found that pollinator community composition was closely related to the abundance of natural areas (250 m radius). We also found evidence of substantial cotton pollen limitation, as significantly larger bolls were produced with the addition of outcross pollen. Further, we reveal that pollen limitation was negatively correlated with pollinator abundance and richness. Path analysis confirmed the two direct effects of land use composition on pollinator community and pollinator community composition on pollen limitation. Overall, our results reveal potential for increased crop yields via wild pollinator-mediated fruit set, equivalent to more than $108/acre with a regional gain of over $1.1 million USD. Further, our research provides insight into the specific land management practices that support pollinator communities within cotton agroecosystems. Cotton landscapes that maintain natural areas promote wild pollinator abundance and diversity, and subsequently experience reduced pollination limitation and increased crop yields.","Species richness,Pollinator,Pollination,Pollen,Land use,Land management,Land cover,Ecology,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Software engineering,Software analytics,Reference software,Statistics,Smoothing spline,Restricted maximum likelihood,Structural equation modeling,Statistics,Statistical hypothesis testing,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination management,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Valuation (finance),Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Xylocopinae,Stingless bee,Pollen basket,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Worker bee,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat","Sarah Cusser,John L.

Sustainability was highest for the agroecological scale (59/100), intermediate for the socioterritorial scale (53/100), and lowest on the economic scale (43/100). The sustainability of a farm is the lowest score of the three scales. In most farms, the lowest was the economic scale. A cluster analysis led to the identification of five distinct groups: Cluster 1 defined two farms not related to others, cluster 2 farms (4) were those with high agroecological scores, cluster 3 farms (8) were most representative of the area, cluster 4 included two farms with low socioterritorial and economic sustainability scores, and cluster 5 was made up of the remaining six farms with the highest economic sustainability score, but limited by the agroecological and socioterritorial scales.

A total of 558 small ruminants (458 sheep and 100 goats) were examined using standard parasitological procedure. The study revealed that the overall prevalence of helminthiasis was 47.67%. The species level prevalence of helminthiasis was 46.07% and 55% in sheep and goats respectively. Strongyles were the most prevalent parasites encountered in the area followed by Fasciola. A statistically significant difference was found in prevalence between sheep and goat. Agroecology was found to be associated with prevalence rate and species of parasite found. Sex and age of the animals were shown to have association with prevalence but significant difference was not found. Therefore during the control and treatment of small ruminant helminthiasis agroecology, species, age and sex of the animals should be considered as potential risk factors for the occurrence of the disease in the study areas.","Veterinary medicine,Species level,Significant difference,Prevalence,Helminths,Helminthiasis,Fasciola,Epidemiology,Biology,Agroecology,Zoology,Trematoda,Protozoa,Veterinary medicine,Significant difference,Parasitism,Total cost,Societal level,Public economics,Virology,Fasciola gigantica,Epidemiology,Veterinary medicine,Toxocara vitulorum,Prevalence,Veterinary medicine,Mixed farming,Helminths,Veterinary medicine,Trichuris,Trichostrongylus,Zoology,Trichuris ovis,Raillietina,Milk yield,Livestock,Immunology,Veterinary medicine,Tanzania,Helminths","Shimelis Dagnachew,Asmare Amamute,Wudu Temesgen,J.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate phenotypic variation of RCA formation in Malawi maize germplasm and confirm the utility of RCA formation in different agroecologies at field stations and on smallholder farms in Malawi. Forty maize accessions collected across Malawi were grown under rainfed field conditions, and a subset contrasting for RCA were grown under well-watered and water stressed conditions at two research stations and under natural drought on farms across two agroecological zones in Malawi. We found substantial variation for RCA in local germplasm ranging from 0% to 37% of root cross sectional area. Suboptimal water availability increased RCA from 54% to 77% across environments. Under water stress high RCA genotypes had 23% to 29% greater leaf relative water content, 67% to 96% greater shoot biomass 70 days after planting, and 78% to 143% greater grain yield than low RCA genotypes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that RCA improves plant growth under drought by reducing the metabolic costs of soil exploration and improving water acquisition. RCA has value as a selection criterion to improve the performance of maize and possibly other cereal crops in water limited environments.","Zea mays,Water content,Sowing,Plant growth,Germplasm,Crop,Botany,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Aerenchyma,Software engineering,Software analytics,Reference software,Mixed effects,Geography,Applied mathematics,Vulnerability,Group ii,Environmental science,Growing season,Geography,Food prices,Subsidy,Green Revolution,Government,Topsoil,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil fertility,Whorl (botany),Root system,Root hair,Terrestrial ecosystem,Soil water,Plant roots,Water-use efficiency,Population,Plant breeding,Trait,Sowing,Root system","Joseph G.

It begins with an account of the struggles of rural social movements working at the deepest grassroots level of the country’s “agroecological field.” The processes that led to the creation and development of the National Agroecology Alliance (ANA) and the Brazilian Agroecology Association (ABA-Agroecologia) are presented as a key part of the construction now under way. Taking as a baseline the evolutions in the internalization of agroecology in official teaching, research, and rural extension services, the article identifies some of the powerful practical, theoretical, and politico-ideological obstacles preventing the rupture with the paradigm of modernization on the part of state institutions.","Social movement,Modernization theory,Institutionalisation,Grassroots,Economics,Economic growth,Development economics,Alliance,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Social movement,Social mobilization,Politics,Political science,Humanities,Molecular interactions,Food supply,Food processing,Sociology,Humanities,Economic growth,Sustainable development,Social sustainability,Public policy","Paulo Petersen,Eros Marion Mussoi,Fabio Dal Soglio,Wendy Wolford,Roberto Ringuelet,Jeff Tollefson,N.E.

933,Management of service crops for the provision of ecosystem services in vineyards: A review,2017-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2017.09.030,"Service crops are crops grown with the aim of providing non-marketed ecosystem services, i.e. differing from food, fiber and fuel production. Vineyard soils face various agronomic issues such as poor organic carbon levels, erosion, fertility losses, and numerous studies have highlighted the ability of service crops to address these issues. In addition to their ability to increase soil organic matter and fertility, and reduce runoff and erosion processes, service crops provide a large variety of ecosystem services in vineyards such as weed control, pest and disease regulation, water supply, water purification, improvement of field trafficability and maintenance of soil biodiversity. However, associating service crops with grapevines may also generate disservices and impair grape production: competition for soil resources with the grapevine is often highlighted to reject such association. Consequently, vinegrowers have to find a balance between services and disservices, depending on local soil and climate conditions, on their objectives of grape production and on the nature and temporality of the ecosystem services they expect during the grapevine cycle. This study proposes a review of the services and disservices provided by service crops in vineyards, and a framework for their management. Vinegrowers' production objectives and pedoclimatic constraints form the preliminary stage to consider before defining a strategy of service crop management. This strategy assembles management options such as the choice of species, its spatial distribution within the vineyard, the timing of its installation, maintenance and destruction. These management options, defined for both annual and long-term time scales, form action levers which may impact cropping system functioning. Finally, we underline the importance of implementing an adaptive strategy at the seasonal time scale. Such tactical management allows adapting the cropping system to observed climate and state of the biophysical system during the grapevine cycle, in order to provide targeted services and achieve satisfactory production objectives.","Water supply,Surface runoff,Soil organic matter,Soil biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Cropping system,Cover crop,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation,Total human ecosystem,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Environmental resource management,Soil science,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Viticulture,Vineyard,Soil contamination,Valuation (finance),Public policy,Environmental resource management,Water table,Water balance,Vine,Soil science,Soil salinity,Soil retrogression and degradation,Surface runoff,Soil structure,Soil organic matter,Surface runoff,Straw,Soil water","Léo Garcia,Florian Celette,Christian Gary,Aude Ripoche,Héctor Valdés-Gómez,Aurélie Metay,Robert Costanza,Rudolf de Groot,Stephen Farberk,Monica Grasso,Bruce Hannon,Douglas A.

934,Limiting livestock production to pasture and by-products in a search for sustainable diets,2015-01-01,Food Policy,10.1016/J.FOODPOL.2015.10.008,"A method was developed for designing ‘fair’ diets (not using more than globally available arable land per capita) and for assessing the sustainability of such diets. The diets were based on the principle of ‘ecological leftovers’ for livestock production, i.e. raising livestock on pasture and by-products not suitable for or wanted by humans. The method was applied to Sweden using three different scenarios for livestock production, all taking the starting point that semi-natural pastures should be grazed by ruminants for reasons of biodiversity conservation. The scenarios also included differing use of by-products (from crop production and food processing) to either boost milk production (I-Milk scenario) or produce eggs and pig meat (E-Milk and Suckler scenarios). In I-Milk, milk and meat were produced in intensive systems in which dairy cows and their offspring only grazed to a limited extent, resulting in the human diet containing recommended levels of dairy products (350ml milk per day) and meat twice a week. Milk could also be exported. In E-Milk, pasture was used more for dairy cows and their offspring, resulting in fewer animals and less milk (150ml milk per day) and four servings of meat per week. In the Suckler scenario, pasture was grazed by suckler herds providing no milk but meat four times per week. The environmental impacts of the diets were assessed using the planetary boundaries framework. The results showed substantially lower environmental impacts compared with the average current Swedish diet, but the strict absolute climate boundary and the N and P input boundaries were still exceeded for all diets. The approach adopted, of letting the ecological resource capacity act as the constraining factor for livestock production, is in line with agroecology principles and efficient use of land to improve food security, and could be useful in discussions about sustainable consumption of animal products.","Sustainability,Per capita,Pasture,Livestock,Food security,Food processing,Economics,Arable land,Animal science,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agricultural economics,Public administration,Political science,Physical science,Planetary boundaries,Humanity,Fresh water,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Underpinning,Planetary boundaries,Planet,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Nutrient,Environmental science,Agronomy,Geography,Food waste,Food systems,Sustainable development,Poverty,Planet,Urbanization,Sustainability,Public health,Geography,Ecosystem diversity,Ecosystem","Elin Röös,Mikaela Patel,Johanna Spångberg,Georg Carlsson,Susan Solomon,Johan Rockström,Will Steffen,Kevin Noone,Åsa Persson,F.

935,Participatory variety selection and characterization of Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) elite accessions from Malawian gene pool using farmer and breeder knowledge,2008-01-01,African Journal of Agricultural Research,,"Participatory approaches for variety selection, breeding, ex-situ and in-situconservation of neglected crops in Malawi was initiated in 1998. The specific objective of the present study was to select diverse and productive sorghum lines adapted to local conditions and accepted by farmers and consumers at large using farmers’ knowledge and breeders’ scientific approach. Participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) were conducted on the major characteristics of sorghum landraces. This was done in village meetings by focused group discussions (FGDs), matrix ranking, and individual interviews. Participatory variety selection was applied to select diversified sorghum lines that possess farmer-preferred plant and grain traits. During the first season, male and female farmers were invited to research stations to select 20 accessions from a pool of 101 landraces. These 20 accessions were evaluated by farmers on community plots managed by them at several sites in different agroecological areas for two years. Selection was based primarily on agronomic traits such as time to maturity, height, drought tolerance, insect resistance, and grain yield. Protein content and genetic differences assessed by the breeders were also used as selection tools. Overall, the results of the present study showed that farmers’ characterization of several accessions combined with statistical, nutritional, and genetic analyses performed by the breeders has allowed selection of sorghum landraces that have out-performed breeder-developed lines on more than one criterion. These lines have been adopted by the farmers and are still being grown in many communities five years avec local release.

936,Tree biodiversity in farmer cooperatives of a shade coffee landscape in western El Salvador,2007-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2006.07.004,"Conservation of tropical biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has become more important as the area covered by natural ecosystems decreases. We analyzed the effects of local livelihoods, cooperative types, and selected biophysical variables (elevation, slope, percent shade, distance to the forest, coffee density, and coffee age) on tree biodiversity in shade coffee cooperatives of El Salvador. Tree inventories from 51 quadrats in coffee cooperatives included 2743 individuals from 46 families and 123 identified tree species. Species richness and tree diameters differed among some cooperatives, with greater richness associated with greater stem density; other biophysical variables had little impact on diversity. The amount of shade in the coffee plantations differed among cooperatives, particularly in the wet season. Of the tree species reported in a recent study of a neighboring forest and in the cooperatives (N = 227 species combined), 16% were present at both sites. The three coffee plantations shared 35% of total species reported from all cooperatives. Our research shows that the number of tree species found in a coffee plantation increases with the density of shade trees included in the system. In turn, agroecological management, as influenced by farmer livelihood strategies and cooperative types, directly affects shade canopy composition. Important factors to take into account are the types of farmer organizations present, the cost of maintaining species of conservation concern, and the potential benefits that conservation could bring to the livelihood strategies of farm households. # 2006 Elsevier B.V.

937,Food quality assessment in organic vs. conventional agricultural produce: Findings and issues,2017-01-01,Applied Soil Ecology,10.1016/J.APSOIL.2017.10.014,"Organic food is increasingly attracting the interest of consumers, as it is perceived to be healthier than food produced by conventional agriculture, and to be more sustainable for the environment. This paper provides a review on the quality of organic produce in terms of its nutritional value, the presence of pesticide residues, heavy metals, mycotoxins and bacterial contamination, and the issue of antibiotics. The use of Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone is addressed. Hydroponic techniques are also discussed. Compared to conventional produce, organic produce is richer in some useful compounds. Nevertheless, heterogeneous findings have been reported. Studies concord in finding organic food much less contaminated by pesticides, and with residues of much lower toxicity compared to those found in conventional foods. As for heavy metals, mycotoxins and bacterial contamination, there are no significant differences in organic produce compared to conventional produce (with the exception of Cd, found to be lower in organic produce, which is a positive finding). More effective and detailed guidelines should be devised for the design and reporting of both primary studies and meta-analyses. Pesticide residues should be assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The issue of multiple residues should also be addressed. Of course, organic produce cannot be assumed, a priori, to be safe. Sound monitoring needs to be constantly performed. It is concluded that organic agriculture can provide important benefits to human health and to the environment, and promote a more compassionate treatment of animals. It is hoped that agricultural policies will pay more attention to organic, agroecological and low-input agricultural practices, and invest in research and innovation.","Pesticide residue,Pesticide,Organic farming,Heavy metals,Food quality,Contamination,Biotechnology,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture",Tiziano Gomiero,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5844566,53,Agroecology Permit Emissions Greenhouse gas Offset

Yet, the benefits of NRM technologies for farmers are often debated. Impacts seem to be context-specific, which are especially relevant in the small farm sector with its large degree of agroecological and socioeconomic heterogeneity. This was not always considered in previous research. We analyze the impacts of SRI adoption on rice yield and household income among smallholder farmers in Timor Leste. Heterogeneity is accounted for in an endogenous switching regression framework. Comparing mean yield and income levels, we find no significant differences between SRI adopters and non-adopters. This is due to negative selection bias; SRI seems to be adopted more on plots and by farmers with less than average yields. Controlling for this bias reveals significant yield and income gains. Poor and non-poor households benefit from SRI adoption; small farms benefit more than larger farms. The results also suggest that in the context of Timor Leste SRI may not be beneficial when compared to conventional rice grown under favorable conditions. Some implications for future research are discussed.","System of Rice Intensification,Small farm,Productivity,Natural resource management,Household income,Environmental resource management,Environmental degradation,Economics,Economic growth,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Variables,Spatial econometrics,Multivariate probit model,Sustainable agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Variables,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Sustainability,Productive capacity,Ecosystem services,Sustainability,Poverty,Population,Unobservable,Simultaneous equations model,Food security,Sustainable development,Resource management,Natural resource management,System of Rice Intensification,Resource poor,Irrigation,Production–possibility frontier,Frontier,Economics,Welfare,Economics,Developing country","Martin Noltze,Stefan Schwarze,Matin Qaim,G.

Seventeen percent of crops from markets contained aflatoxin concentrations above allowable levels in Zambia (10 μg kg−1). Proportions of crops unsafe for human consumption differed significantly (P<0.001) among agroecologies with more contamination (38%) in the warmest (Agroecology I) and the least (8%) in cool, wet Agroecology III. Aflatoxin in groundnut (39 μg kg−1) and maize (16 μg kg−1) differed (P=0.032). Poor storage (31°C, 100% RH, 1 week) increased aflatoxin in safe crops by over 1,000 fold in both maize and groundnut. The L morphotype of A. flavus was negatively correlated with post-harvest increases in groundnut. Conclusions Aflatoxins are common in Zambia's food staples with proportions of unsafe crops dependent on agroecology. Fungal community structure influences contamination suggesting Zambia would benefit from biocontrol with atoxigenic A. flavus. Significance and Impact of Study Aflatoxin contamination across the three agroecologies of Zambia are detailed and the case for aflatoxin management with atoxigenic biocontrol agents provided. The first method for evaluating the potential for aflatoxin increase after purchase is presented. This article is protected by copyright.

941,"Ecological Intensification Through Pesticide Reduction: Weed Control, Weed Biodiversity and Sustainability in Arable Farming",2015-01-01,Environmental Management,10.1007/S00267-015-0554-5,"Amongst the biodiversity components of agriculture, weeds are an interesting model for exploring management options relying on the principle of ecological intensification in arable farming. Weeds can cause severe crop yield losses, contribute to farmland functional biodiversity and are strongly associated with the generic issue of pesticide use. In this paper, we address the impacts of herbicide reduction following a causal framework starting with herbicide reduction and triggering changes in (i) the management options required to control weeds, (ii) the weed communities and functions they provide and (iii) the overall performance and sustainability of the implemented land management options. The three components of this framework were analysed in a multidisciplinary project that was conducted on 55 experimental and farmer’s fields that included conventional, integrated and organic cropping systems. Our results indicate that the reduction of herbicide use is not antagonistic with crop production, provided that alternative practices are put into place. Herbicide reduction and associated land management modified the composition of in-field weed communities and thus the functions of weeds related to biodiversity and production. Through a long-term simulation of weed communities based on alternative (?) cropping systems, some specific management pathways were identified that delivered high biodiversity gains and limited the negative impacts of weeds on crop production. Finally, the multi-criteria assessment of the environmental, economic and societal sustainability of the 55 systems suggests that integrated weed management systems fared better than their conventional and organic counterparts. These outcomes suggest that sustainable management could possibly be achieved through changes in weed management, along a pathway starting with herbicide reduction.","Weed control,Weed,Sustainable management,Sustainability,Land management,Economics,Cropping system,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide,Soil science,Population,Organic farming,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Greenhouse gas,Food systems,Land use,Land management,Habitat,Terrestrial ecosystem,Sustainable yield,Soil biodiversity,Weed control,Weed,Trophic level,Species richness,Organic farming,Land use,Manure,Environmental pollution,Environmental health,Umbrella term,Sociology of scientific knowledge,Performance indicator","Sandrine Petit,Nicolas Munier-Jolain,Vincent Bretagnolle,Christian Bockstaller,Jonathan A.

942,Improved tree fallows in smallholder maize production in Zambia: do initial testers adopt the technology?,2005-01-01,Agroforestry Systems,10.1007/S10457-004-2410-0,"In eastern Zambia, population growth has reduced per-capita land availability to such an extent that traditional bush fallows can no longer be practiced, and low soil fertility is a major constraint to crop production. Improved fallows (IF) based on leguminous trees are a low cash-input agroforestry practice to restore soil fertility. The objective of the study reported here was to assess the adoption of IF by farmers who tested the technology, including the extent to which the technology is practiced relative to its potential scale. The socioeconomic and agroecological determinants of the incidence and scale of adoption are estimated using a two-stage Heckman regression model that corrects for sample selection bias. Seventy-five percent of the testers have adopted the technology, which shows that IF are a suitable practice under conditions of capital scarcity, inadequate access to markets for fertilizer, and relatively low population density, which prevail in large parts of southern Africa. Adopters practice the technology to 42% of its potential scale; a non-linear relationship was found between wealth and the incidence as well as the scale of adoption; land and labor availability limit further expansion. Hence, future on-farm research should emphasize IF options which reduce land and labor requirements such as intercropping IF species with maize, and IF species which can be seeded directly.","Soil fertility,Selection bias,Scarcity,Population growth,Intercropping,Cultural practice,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Verification bias,Statistics,Simple linear regression,Variable cost,Technological change,Small farm,Soil fertility,Natural resource economics,Natural resource,Traditional knowledge,Soil fertility,Sesbania sesban,Tropics,Sustainability,Soil fertility,Soil fertility,Opportunity cost,Intercropping,Weed,Sesbania sesban,Sesbania,Technology transfer,Soil fertility,Innovation adoption,Sowing,Sesbania sesban,Poor people,Technological change,Rural area,Incentive","Alwin Keil,Manfred Zeller,Steven Franzel,James Heckman,G.

943,Dual targeting: Combining costimulation blockade and bortezomib to permit kidney transplantation in sensitized recipients.,2019-01-01,American Journal of Transplantation,10.1111/AJT.15067,": Previous evidence suggests that a homeostatic germinal center (GC) response may limit bortezomib desensitization therapy. We evaluated the combination of costimulation blockade with bortezomib in a sensitized non-human primate kidney transplant model. Sensitized animals were treated with bortezomib, belatacept, and anti-CD40 mAb twice weekly for a month (n = 6) and compared to control animals (n = 7). Desensitization therapy-mediated DSA reductions approached statistical significance (P = .07) and significantly diminished bone marrow PCs, lymph node follicular helper T cells, and memory B cell proliferation. Graft survival was prolonged in the desensitization group (P = .073). All control animals (n = 6) experienced graft loss due to antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) after kidney transplantation, compared to one desensitized animal (1/5). Overall, histological AMR scores were significantly lower in the treatment group (n = 5) compared to control (P = .020). However, CMV disease was common in the desensitized group (3/5). Desensitized animals were sacrificed after long-term follow-up with functioning grafts. Dual targeting of both plasma cells and upstream GC responses successfully prolongs graft survival in a sensitized NHP model despite significant infectious complications and drug toxicity. Further work is planned to dissect underlying mechanisms, and explore safety concerns.","Memory B cell,Medicine,Lymph node,Kidney transplantation,Immunology,Germinal center,Desensitization (telecommunications),Bortezomib,Bone marrow,Belatacept,Transplant glomerulopathy,Serology,Pathology,Medicine,Immunology,Family medicine,Urinary system,Transplantation Conditioning,Transplantation,Transplantation,Reporting system,Molecular pathology,Waiting list,Treatment outcome,Pediatrics,Transplantation,Surgery,Regimen,Transplantation,Toxicity,Proteasome inhibitor,Transplantation,Survival rate,Surgery,Urinary system,Transplant glomerulopathy,Positive crossmatch,Transplantation,Rituximab,Proteasome inhibitor","Christopher K.

944,Regenerative agriculture: merging farming and natural resource conservation profitably,2018-01-01,PeerJ,10.7717/PEERJ.4428,": Most cropland in the United States is characterized by large monocultures, whose productivity is maintained through a strong reliance on costly tillage, external fertilizers, and pesticides (Schipanski et al., 2016). Despite this, farmers have developed a regenerative model of farm production that promotes soil health and biodiversity, while producing nutrient-dense farm products profitably. Little work has focused on the relative costs and benefits of novel regenerative farming operations, which necessitates studying in situ, farmer-defined best management practices. Here, we evaluate the relative effects of regenerative and conventional corn production systems on pest management services, soil conservation, and farmer profitability and productivity throughout the Northern Plains of the United States. Regenerative farming systems provided greater ecosystem services and profitability for farmers than an input-intensive model of corn production. Pests were 10-fold more abundant in insecticide-treated corn fields than on insecticide-free regenerative farms, indicating that farmers who proactively design pest-resilient food systems outperform farmers that react to pests chemically. Regenerative fields had 29% lower grain production but 78% higher profits over traditional corn production systems. Profit was positively correlated with the particulate organic matter of the soil, not yield. These results provide the basis for dialogue on ecologically based farming systems that could be used to simultaneously produce food while conserving our natural resource base: two factors that are pitted against one another in simplified food production systems. To attain this requires a systems-level shift on the farm; simply applying individual regenerative practices within the current production model will not likely produce the documented results.","Soil conservation,Regenerative agriculture,Monoculture,Food systems,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Conservation agriculture,Biology,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural science,Soil organic matter,Soil management,Soil fertility,Land grabbing,Food security,Ecosystem services,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Land cover,Population,Pest control,Ostrinia,Yield gap,Phosphorus,Organic farming,Water quality,Surface runoff,Pesticide,Urban planning,Soil science,Soil quality,Toxicology,Medicine,Internal medicine,Tillage,Soil water,Soil test,Tillage,Soil structure,Soil organic matter","Claire E.

This pest recently invaded the Mediterranean Basin where it threatens Solanaceous crops. Holistic approaches are required to project the potential geographic distribution and relative abundance of invasive species and hence are pivotal to developing sound policy for their management. This need is increasing dramatically in the face of a surge in biological invasions and climate change. However, while holistic analyses of invasive species are often advocated, they are rarely implemented. We propose that physiologically based demographic models (PBDMs) in the context of a geographic information system (GIS) can provide the appropriate level of synthesis required to capture the complex interactions basic to manage invasive species such as T. absoluta.

946,Advances and Perspectives to Improve the Phosphorus Availability in Cropping Systems for Agroecological Phosphorus Management,2014-01-01,Advances in Agronomy,10.1016/BS.AGRON.2015.06.003,"Abstract Phosphorus (P) is a limiting nutrient for the productivity of many agroecosystems, and the depletion of global mineral P reserves is of concern for global food security. On the other hand, overfertilization with P and its subsequent export through runoff can cause eutrophication of water bodies and natural terrestrial habitats. An important challenge is therefore to develop productive farming systems in which P availability in soils is increased, while reducing mineral P inputs, outputs, and negative off-site impacts. Increasing the P availability in cropping systems requires several approaches including management of soil properties and P amendments, agroecology of cropping systems, and plant breeding. The objective of the present review is to identify new research perspectives in agronomy and emerging strategies to improve the P availability in cropping systems. For this purpose, we explore the following: (1) the use of renewable waste-derived P resources (including crop residues, excreta, struvite, and biochar) to improve P availability, particularly the impacts of applications of such renewable P sources on the chemical properties of the soil, soil organic matter dynamics, soil microbial and rhizospheric activity, and, ultimately, P availability; (2) the effects of multispecies cropping system on P availability, notably the incorporation of the concepts of positive plant–soil feedback on P availability, previously demonstrated in grassland and forest ecosystems, to multispecies cropping systems; and (3) the identification of genetic traits of plant–microorganism relations involved in the tolerance of low-P soils to improve plant breeding outcomes. The challenge for sustainable management of P resources for agriculture is now to reengineer agricultural systems at several scales and to define P management strategies in cropping systems by combining the use of renewable P resources and the management of soil properties, multispecies cropping system, and crop cultivars that increase soil P availability.","Sustainable management,Soil organic matter,Soil fertility,Forest ecology,Cropping system,Cropping,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Physics,Library science,Chemistry,Scarcity,Phosphorus,Phosphorite,Soil organic matter,Soil fertility,Soil conditioner,Engineering physics,Chemistry,Politics,History,Greenhouse gas removal,Soil carbon,Slash-and-char,Greenhouse gas,Water treatment,Water pollution,Wastewater,Plant breeding,Phosphorus deficiency,Phosphorus,Soil science,Soil pH,Soil organic matter,Terrestrial ecosystem,Phosphorus metabolism,Phosphorus","Michel-Pierre Faucon,David Houben,Jean-Paul Reynoird,Anne-Maïmiti Mercadal-Dulaurent,Romain Armand,Hans Lambers,David R Lide,Dana Cordell,Jan-Olof Drangert,Stuart White,Johannes Lehmann,Matthias C.

We have attempted to reverse the silencing of this HSC genetic program by the sequential treatment of human cord blood CD34+ cells with the chromatin-modifying agents, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5azaD) and trichostatin A (TSA). We determined that all CD34+CD90+ cells treated with 5azaD/TSA and cytokines after 9 days of incubation divide, but to a lesser degree than cells exposed to only cytokines. When CD34+CD90+ cells that have undergone extensive number of cell divisions (5-10) in the presence of cytokines alone were transplanted into immunodeficient mice, donor cell chimerism was not detectable. By contrast, 5azaD/TSA-treated cells that have undergone similar numbers of cell divisions retained their marrow repopulating potential. The expression of several genes and their products previously implicated in HSC self-renewal were up-regulated in the cells treated with 5azaD/TSA as compared to cells exposed to cytokines alone. These data indicate that HSC treated with chromatin-modifying agents are capable of undergoing repeated cell divisions in vitro while retaining their marrow-repopulating potential.","Trichostatin A,Stem cell,Immunology,Haematopoiesis,Cytokine,Cord blood,Cell division,CD90,CD34,Biology,TaqMan,Sample handling,Real-time polymerase chain reaction,Stem cell,Stem Cell Self-Renewal,Programmed cell death,Stem cell theory of aging,Stem cell factor,Stem cell,Stem cell,Integrin,Hematopoietic stem cell,Stem cell,Proliferation kinetics,Molecular biology,Transcription factor,Stem cell,Progenitor cell,Stem cell,Progenitor cell,Immunology,Molecular biology,Haematopoiesis,GATA2,Stem cell,Self renewal,Progenitor cell,Immunology,Growth factor,Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor","Hiroto Araki,Kazumi Yoshinaga,Piernicola Boccuni,Yan Zhao,Ronald Hoffman,Nadim Mahmud,C A Heid,J Stevens,K J Livak,P M Williams,In Kyung Park,Dalong Qian,Mark Kiel,Michael W.

Three periods of the soil transformation are distinguished. The first period was characterized by the use of machines with relatively small pressure on the soil and by the dynamic equilibrium between the physical state of the soils and the processes of the humification-mineralization of the soil organic matter. The use of power-intensive machines in the next period resulted in greater soil compaction with negative changes in the soil physical properties. At the same time, the physical properties of the chernozems remained close to optimum on the fields where heavy machines were not used. The third period was characterized by the use of heavy machines and by the decrease in the rates of the organic and mineral fertilizers and certain disturbances in the crop rotation systems because of the economic difficulties.

949,Landscape scale management affects weed richness but not weed abundance in winter wheat fields,2016-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2016.02.031,"Abstract Farmland biodiversity provides ecological services that support food production, but the spatial scale(s) at which its management should be implemented is an acute question today. Effective management of weeds is a particularly hot issue as these plants can cause yield loss but support farmland biodiversity. In a general context of pesticide reduction, a clear understanding of how agricultural managements at different spatial scales interact with one another in shaping weed communities is required to develop sustainable weed management strategies. Here, we analyzed the contribution of potential drivers of weed species richness and weed abundance in 125 winter-wheat fields under a gradient of crop management intensity. We hypothesized that (i) local management practices in fields and (ii) the structure and composition of the landscape surrounding these fields would both explain the variations in weed richness and weed abundance observed within the study area. Linear mixed-effects models that included sequentially three sets of explanatory variables (farming system, local management practices, landscape structure and management) were applied and the relative performance of models was compared by AIC. Our analysis showed that weed species richness responded to factors acting at multiple spatial scales, with a predominant effect of landscape scale management, namely the proportion of organic farming within a 1 km radius. In contrast, weed abundance was difficult to predict and responded solely to few local management practices. As weed richness and abundance did not respond at the same spatial scales, we conclude that it may be possible to combine local and longer-term landscape management levers to deliver reduced weed infestation levels and enhanced arable biodiversity.","Weed control,Weed,Species richness,Spatial ecology,Organic farming,Ecology,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Statistical theory,Statistical inference,Model selection,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide,Source–sink dynamics,Sink (computing),Reproductive success,Weed control,Weed,Trophic level,Organic farming,Land use,Environmental change,Species richness,Pollinator,Pollination,Sustainable development,Species richness,Landscape ecology,Species richness,Spatial ecology,Plant community,Temperate climate,Intensive farming,Grassland","Sandrine Petit,Sabrina Gaba,Anne-Laure Grison,Helmut Meiss,Kenneth P.

950,Crop competition in winter wheat has a higher potential than farming practices to regulate weeds,2018-01-01,Ecosphere,10.1002/ECS2.2413,"Management of biotic interactions has been recognized as a potential substitute for costly agrochemical inputs. Competition is one of the most important biotic interactions known to regulate populations and govern species assemblages. However, although theoretical and empirical work has been produced on competition, in situ experimental evidence is much scantier, mainly because of the difficulty of manipulating competition in the field. Arable weeds offer an outstanding opportunity to meet this challenge, because of the relative ease of in situ experimental manipulation and because of the urgent need to find sustainable weed management strategies. Here, we assess the importance of crop competition and two main conventional farming practices (N fertilizer and weed control) on weed species richness, abundance, and biomass. We set up an experiment with a design with two factors, presence/absence of crops and presence/absence of N fertilizer and weed control, in working farm fields with winter cereals as the target crop. We found that the crop competition reduced weed biomass production by almost 65%, as a result of the crop's competitive advantage from its greater ability to take up N, while the effect on weed species richness was less important. Our results also show that the effect of crop competition on the weed assemblage was much stronger than the effect of N fertilizer and weed control. The decrease in weed abundance and biomass mainly resulted from a strong effect of the crop on the dominant species, while the abundance of intermediate species tended to be much less affected, a result consistent with studies in grasslands where the removal of the dominant species provides a competitive release for subordinate ones.

Dairy farms in many world regions are larger and concentrated in fewer hands. Higher productivity can increase overall economic gains but also incurs site-specific social and environmental costs. In this paper, we review the drivers and impacts of dairy intensification. We identify in the literature four prominent concerns about dairy intensification: the environment, animal welfare, socioeconomic well-being, and human health. We then critically assess three frameworks—sustainable intensification, multifunctionality, and agroecology—which promise win–win solutions to these concerns. We call for research and policy approaches that can better account for synergies and trade-offs among the multiple dimensions of dairy impacts. Specifically, we suggest the need to (1) consider dairy system transitions within broader processes of social-environmental change and (2) investigate how certain framings and metrics may lead to uneven social-environmental outcomes. Such work can help visualize transformations towards more equitable, ethical, and sustainable food systems.","Sustainable agriculture,Socioeconomic status,Natural resource economics,Multiple time dimensions,Human health,Food systems,Environmental resource management,Biology,Animal welfare,Agroecology,Agricultural intensification,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Urbanization,Sustainability,Public health,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Greenhouse gas,Food systems,Supply chain,Natural resource economics,Livestock,Sustainable agriculture,Soil conservation,Integrated pest management,Sustainability,Livestock,Greenhouse gas,Valuation (finance),Per capita,Gross domestic product,Population,Per capita,Land use,Water quality,Sustainability science,Reactive nitrogen","Nathan Clay,Tara Garnett,Jamie Lorimer,H.

They have put forward several proposals for new directions. These include particularly ecologically intensive agriculture, which is examined here. The objective of this paper is to contribute to analyzing the possible pathways to and socioeconomic challenges facing ecologically intensive agriculture, founded upon the sustainable use of natural processes and ecosystem functions while achieving a good level of yield. Firstly, the notion of ecological intensification by comparison/opposition with conventional forms of agricultural intensification is presented. The positions of the various actors, in relationship to the concept of ecologically intensive agriculture, are then examined. If this movement towards ecological intensification is apparently garnering a rather good consensus, there are in fact many hurdles to the implementation of these practices. Finally, we analyze some opportunities, barriers and facing the development of ecologically intensive agriculture. Such an evolution notably requires a context in agreement with it.","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Sustainability,Opposition (planets),Multidisciplinary approach,Intensive farming,Environmental resource management,Environmental planning,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Soil management,Renewable resource,Renewable energy,Polyculture,Spatial heterogeneity,Soil structure,Soil quality,Paradigm shift,Land use,Food processing,Sustainability,Population growth,Green Revolution,Sustainable agriculture,Publics,Livestock,Sustainable agriculture,Remote sensing,Land use,Public sector,Psychological resilience,Natural resource economics,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Self-sufficiency,Social dynamics,Reflexivity,Participatory action research","Sylvie Bonny,Pablo Tittonell,Ken E.

To that end, several policies, including hybrid price-quantity mechanisms and the newly introduced “market stability reserve” (MSR) systems, have been introduced and even implemented in some cases. I develop a stochastic dynamic model of a cap-and-trade system, parameterized to values relevant to the European Union׳s Emission Trading System (EU ETS) to analyze the performance of these policies aimed at adding stability to the system or at least at reducing perceived over-allocations of permits. Results suggest that adaptive-allocation mechanisms such as a price collar or MSR can reduce permit over-allocations and permit price volatility in a more cost-effective manner than simply reducing scheduled permit allocations. However, it is also found that the performance of these adaptive allocation policies, and in particular the MSR, are greatly affected by assumed discount rates and policy parameters.","Volatility (finance),Microeconomics,Market stability,European union,Emissions trading,Economics,Collar,Natural borrowing limit,Microeconomics,Greenhouse gas,Welfare economics,Scrutiny,Resource allocation,Stochastic programming,Price ceiling,Microeconomics,Theory,Stochastic programming,Optimization problem,Welfare economics,Microeconomics,Marginal utility,Public economics,Pollution,Natural resource economics,Safety valve,Microeconomics,Interest rate,Total cost,Public finance,Pollution,Pollution,Optimal control,Microeconomics,Minimum price,Microeconomics,Macroeconomics","Harrison G.

955,"Family poultry: Multiple roles, systems, challenges, and options for sustainable contributions to household nutrition security through a planetary health lens",2018-01-01,Maternal and Child Nutrition,10.1111/MCN.12668,": Achieving sustainable production of eggs by family poultry production systems that meet both environmental health and welfare standards is a complex endeavour. Humans have been raising different species of poultry for thousands of years across many different agroecological zones. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has identified four different family poultry production systems: small extensive, extensive, semi-intensive, and intensive. Each of these systems varies in terms of inputs, outputs, gender dimensions, poultry health and welfare, and environmental impacts. This paper addresses key issues associated with the production of family poultry eggs in support of both improved maternal and child nutrition and sustainable, nutrition-sensitive agricultural practices. It provides an overview of the history of poultry raising; characteristics of the different family poultry production systems; challenges and solutions to poultry production in low- and middle-income countries; poultry husbandry (including breeds, nutrition, and shelter); infectious disease prevention and control in line with national and international animal health regulations; and food safety (microbial pathogens, toxins, and egg storage). To ensure that bird, human, and environmental health can flourish, it is essential for interdisciplinary research and development teams to work in collaboration with communities to ensure the long-term environmental and economic sustainability of family poultry production enterprises that are a good fit with local circumstances.","Welfare,Planetary health,Nursing,Natural resource economics,Medicine,Key issues,Food security,Food safety,Animal husbandry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Livestock,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Waste treatment,Waste management,Waste disposal,World health,Workgroup,Public health,Wildlife conservation,Psychological intervention,Poverty,Population,Per capita,Livestock,Toxicology,Laundry,Ingestion,Virology,Socioeconomics,Rural area,Risk factor,Prospective cohort study,Pediatrics,Veterinary medicine,Risk factor,Meta-analysis,Veterinary Drugs,Pharmacology,Pharmacokinetics","Robyn G.

However, debates also exist on whether OF can feed a world with increasing human population. We hypothesized that some improvements on OF may produce adequate crops and reduce environmental pollutions from CF. This paper makes comparative analysis of crop yield, soil organic matter and economic benefits within the practice on Biodiversity Management of Organic Farming (BMOF) at Hongyi Organic Farm (HOF) over eight years and between BMOF and CF. Linking crop production with livestock to maximal uses of by-products from each production and avoid xenobiotic chemicals, we have achieved beneficial improvement in soil properties, effective pest and weed control, and increased crop yields. After eight years experiment, we have obtained a gradual but stable increase in crop yields with a 9.6-fold increase of net income. The net income of HOF was 258,827 dollars and 24,423 dollars in 2014 and 2007 respectively. Thus, BMOF can not only feed more population, but also increase adaptive capacity of agriculture ecosystems and gain much higher economic benefits.","Soil organic matter,Population,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Intensive crop farming,Crop yield,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Sustainable development,Poverty,Planet,Soil water,Soil pH,Soil classification,Waterlogging (agriculture),Leaching (agriculture),Irrigation,Zoology,Toxicology,Toxicity,Soil science,Population,Organic farming,Species richness,Species diversity,Global warming,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Natural capital,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource","Haitao Liu,Jie Meng,Wenjing Bo,Da Cheng,Yong Li,Liyue Guo,Caihong Li,Yanhai Zheng,Meizhen Liu,Tangyuan Ning,Guanglei Wu,Xiaofan Yu,Sufei Feng,Tana Wuyun,Jing Li,Lijun Li,Yan Zeng,Shi V.

A core hypothesis behind this claim is that crop genotypes with the highest individual fitness in a mixture of genotypes will not produce the highest population yield, because fitness is often increased by “selfish” behaviors, which reduce population performance. We tested this hypothesis by growing 35 cultivars of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in mixtures and monocultures, and analyzing the relationship between population yield in monoculture and individual yield in mixture. The relationship was unimodal, as predicted. The highest-yielding populations were from cultivars that had intermediate fitness, and these produced, on average, 35% higher yields than cultivars with the highest fitness. It is unlikely that plant breeding or genetic engineering can improve traits that natural selection has been optimizing for millions of years, but there is unutilized potential in traits that increase crop yield by decreasing individual fitness.","Population,Plant breeding,Natural selection,Monoculture,Group selection,Ecology,Cultivar,Crop yield,Biotechnology,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Sociobiology,Social evolution,Pluralism (political theory),Weed control,Toxicology,Glyphosate,Genetic diversity,Ecosystem services,Ecosystem diversity,Unit root,Shoot,Point of delivery,Shade avoidance,Sensory ecology,Plant community,Toxicology,Organism,Marine research,Vegetation,Signalling,Shoot,Soil volume,Root mass,Plant roots,Oryza sativa,Molecular interactions,Intensive farming,Natural selection,Mathematics,Group selection","Jacob Weiner,Yan‐Lei Du,Cong Zhang,Xiao‐Liang Qin,Feng‐Min Li,David Sloan Wilson,Edward O.

965,Indigenous burning as conservation practice: neotropical savanna recovery amid agribusiness deforestation in Central Brazil.,2013-01-01,PLOS ONE,10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0081226,"International efforts to address climate change by reducing tropical deforestation increasingly rely on indigenous reserves as conservation units and indigenous peoples as strategic partners. Considered win-win situations where global conservation measures also contribute to cultural preservation, such alliances also frame indigenous peoples in diverse ecological settings with the responsibility to offset global carbon budgets through fire suppression based on the presumed positive value of non-alteration of tropical landscapes. Anthropogenic fire associated with indigenous ceremonial and collective hunting practices in the Neotropical savannas (cerrado) of Central Brazil is routinely represented in public and scientific conservation discourse as a cause of deforestation and increased CO2 emissions despite a lack of supporting evidence. We evaluate this claim for the Xavante people of Pimentel Barbosa Indigenous Reserve, Brazil. Building upon 23 years of longitudinal interdisciplinary research in the area, we used multi-temporal spatial analyses to compare land cover change under indigenous and agribusiness management over the last four decades (1973–2010) and quantify the contemporary Xavante burning regime contributing to observed patterns based on a four year sample at the end of this sequence (2007–2010). The overall proportion of deforested land remained stable inside the reserve (0.6%) but increased sharply outside (1.5% to 26.0%). Vegetation recovery occurred where reserve boundary adjustments transferred lands previously deforested by agribusiness to indigenous management. Periodic traditional burning by the Xavante had a large spatial distribution but repeated burning in consecutive years was restricted. Our results suggest a need to reassess overreaching conservation narratives about the purported destructiveness of indigenous anthropogenic fire in the cerrado. The real challenge to conservation in the fire-adapted cerrado biome is the long-term sustainability of indigenous lands and other tropical conservation islands increasingly subsumed by agribusiness expansion rather than the localized subsistence practices of indigenous and other traditional peoples.","Sustainability,Subsistence agriculture,Indigenous,Geography,Fire protection,Environmental protection,Deforestation,Biome,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agribusiness","James R.

966,Yield of synthetic backcross-derived lines in rainfed environments of Australia,2007-01-01,Euphytica,10.1007/S10681-007-9381-Y,"Wheat is one of the major food crops in the world. It is Australia's largest crop and most important agricultural commodity. In Australia the crop is grown under rainfed conditions with inherently important regional environmental differences; wheat growing areas are characterized by winter dominant rainfall in southern and western Australia and summer rainfall in northern Australia. Maximizing yield potential across these diverse regions is dependent upon managing, either genetically or agronomically, those factors in the environment that limit yield. The potential of synthetic backcross lines (SBLs) to increase yield in the diverse agroecological zones of Australia was investigated. Significant yield advantages were found for many of the SBLs across diverse environments. Depending on the environment, the yield of the SBLs ranged from 8% to 30% higher than the best local check in Australia. Apart from adaptation to semiarid water stressed conditions, some SBLs were also found to be significantly higher yielding under more optimal (irrigated) conditions. The four testing environments were classified into two groups, with the northern and southern environments being in separate groups. An elite group of SBLs was identified that exhibited broad adaptation across all diverse Australian environments included in this study. Other SBLs showed specific adaptation to either northern or southern Australia. This study showed that SBLs are likely to provide breeders with the opportunity to significantly improve wheat yield beyond what was previously possible in a number of diverse production environments.","Rainfed agriculture,Poaceae,Pattern analysis,Northern australia,Crop,Botany,Biology,Backcrossing,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agricultural commodity,Data science,Biplot,Biology,Ward's method,Ward method,Mutually exclusive events,Variogram,Statistics,Spatial variability,Statistics,Square root of a 2 by 2 matrix,Square matrix,Status report,Plant breeding,Pattern analysis,Sowing,Plant breeding,Physiology,New materials,Growing region,Grain yield,Plant breeding,Gene–environment interaction,Genetic model,Geography,Ethnology,Tropics,Statistical analysis,Soil science","Francis C.

Interviews demonstrated the importance of socially influential farmers working in tandem with public and private agencies to build initial interest in these practices.

The method of FAO's agroecological zones was applied to the assessment of the attainable sugarcane yield, while Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE) data were used as observed yield. Sugarcane efficiency production in Sao Paulo state was evaluated in two growing seasons, and its correlation with some physical factors that regulate production was calculated. A strong relationship was identified between crop production efficiency and soil aptitude. This allowed inferring the effect of agribusiness factors on crop production efficiency. The relationships between production efficiency and climatic variables were also quantified and indicated that solar radiation, annual rainfall, water deficiency, and maximum air temperature are the main factors affecting the sugarcane production efficiency.","Thermal efficiency,Simulation modeling,Growing season,Geoprocessing,Crop yield,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural engineering,Agribusiness,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Renewable resource,Water balance,Simulation modeling,Irrigation,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Water supply,Water supply,Solar energy,Soil water,Water use,Sugar,Simulation modeling,Xylem,Stomatal conductance,Soil water,Waste management,Renewable fuels,Primary energy,Sunshine duration,Random variable,Probability distribution,Sugar,Stalk,Soil water,Spontaneous process,Solar energy,Solar constant","Fábio Ricardo Marin,Maria Leonor Lopes-Assad,Eduardo Delgado Assad,Carlos Eduardo Vian,Marcelo Cabral Santos,José Goldemberg,Gordon Y.

970,Sugarcane land use and water resources assessment in the expansion area in Brazil,2016-01-01,Journal of Cleaner Production,10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2016.06.074,"Abstract Given that sustainability of Brazilian ethanol is intrinsically associated with the effects of sugarcane expansion on land use changes, this paper aims to assess sugarcane land use using data such as sugarcane yield, water requirements, land expansion and production costs under rainfed and irrigated management. The Paranaiba basin was selected as a case study because of recent large scale expansion of sugarcane. Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) methodology was used to identify sugarcane dynamics during four crop seasons. Crop water requirements, through the water footprint methodology, cane yield, and production costs were estimated by combining the Agroecological Zone Model and CanaSoft. Results show that most sugarcane was spatially distributed in the central area of the basin, with less potential for yield gain through irrigation. This region has significant water availability issues. A 54% increase in sugarcane area (617,000–947,000 ha) was identified, mostly from the central region to the west, and to a lesser extent to the southeast. Both expansion areas represent improved edaphoclimatic (soil and climatic) conditions, hence, higher yields, lower water footprint, and lower production costs under rainfed and irrigated managements. Furthermore, there are less subbasins with water quantity problems and almost none with water quality or both quantity and quality concerns, which suggests greater possibilities for accessing water for irrigation; however, there is an environmental cost associated with this practice on average, 13 m 3  Mg −1 (Mega gram, 10 6  g) of blue water footprint. In the context of this highly water-intensive crop, sugarcane expansion in the Paranaiba basin in areas of improved soil and climatic conditions enhances the sustainability of ethanol production in Brazil.","Water use,Water resources,Water resource management,Water quality,Land use,Irrigation,Enhanced vegetation index,Economics,Crop,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Lysimeter,Irrigation management,Evapotranspiration,Water use,Water transport,Water supply,Water use,Water pollution,Water balance,Spatial analysis,Soft classification,Sampling scheme,Variogram,Stochastic simulation,Statistics,Vantage point,Urban landscape,Remote sensing,Straw,Remote sensing,Pasture,Water use,Environmental science,Environmental engineering,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Water supply,Water use,Soil water,Irrigation management","Fábio Vale Scarpare,Thayse Aparecida Dourado Hernandes,Simone Toni Ruiz-Corrêa,Michelle Cristina Araújo Picoli,Richard G.

971,Extending agroecology: Grower participation in partnerships is key to social learning,2006-01-01,Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems,10.1079/RAF2005131,"The extension of agroecology requires an alternative extension pedagogy. Agroecology is more than merely the promotion of new technologies or practices, but rather a fresh understanding of how to optimize the configuration of biological and technological components of farming systems informed by ecological principles. This necessarily requires a shift in roles among growers and extensionists so that they can actively participate in networks of social learning. Agro-environmental partnerships have emerged in California as the primary strategy for extending alternative, agroecological knowledge in conventional agriculture. Partnerships are an intentional, multi-year relationship among at least growers, a growers' organization, and one or more scientists to extend agroecological knowledge and protect natural resources through a field-scale demonstration. Partnerships have been particularly successful in perennial crop farming systems, and have played critical roles in helping California's almond and pear growers to reduce organophosphate use by over 75%. This study provides a cross partnership comparison of grower participation in partnerships and proposes a five-part typology to rank this.","Social network,Social learning,Natural resource,General partnership,Emerging technologies,Economics,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agroecological restoration,Agricultural extension,Trustworthiness,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Tourism,Rural settlement,Rural poverty,Sustainable development,Resource management,Natural resource management,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Technology transfer,Rural area,Participatory technology development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Sustainability,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Information technology,Information system,Business,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Personal knowledge management,Organizational learning,Knowledge management","Keith Douglass Warner,Jules N.

972,The use of human waste for peri-urban agriculture in Northern Ghana,2005-01-01,Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems,10.1079/RAF200491,"In Ghana, studies on the use of organic materials to increase soil productivity have focused on crop-residue management, use of green and animal manures, and legume cover cropping. Few studies have assessed the use of human waste for agriculture, even though this is widely practiced by farmers in the northern part of the country. This study was carried out to investigate the stakeholders in the use of faecal sludge (FS) for crop production in Tamale and Bolgatanga municipalities in the guinea savanna agroecological zone of Ghana. The aim was to determine the driving factors, constraints and potentials for this practice. Field survey and focus group discussions were carried out among 90 farmers who use FS, and officials of the Municipal Sanitation Unit were interviewed. Sixty-four percent of farmers interviewed used FS as a cost-effective way to improve soil fertility and increase yields of maize and sorghum. Sludge is discharged by spreading it on the soil surface, or it is stored and dried in pits during the dry season and incorporated into the soil at the onset of the rainy season. The high temperatures of the savanna climate and this long period of drying allow sludge to be handled easily. Although this treatment is perceived to reduce the number of pathogens in dried sludge, 22% of farmers complained of itching feet and foot rot after working with FS, which is done without wearing protective foot covering. This constraint is coupled with the foul smell, transport problem and public mockery associated with the use of human waste for agriculture. In spite of these problems, there is competition for FS among farmers, due to benefits derived from its use. Further investigation is required to ascertain the causes of itching feet and foot rot, and there is a need for education on proper handling and appropriate hygiene practices when working with FS. Information regarding optimal FS application rates is also required.","Wet season,Soil fertility,Sanitation,Peri-urban agriculture,Human waste,Economics,Cover crop,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Wastewater,Sanitation,Public health,White paper,Sewerage,Sanitation,Water resource management,Water quality,Wastewater,Waste management,Stabilization pond,Sludge bulking,Urban agriculture,Sanitation,Geography","Olufunke O.

It is the result of a broad-based multi-stakeholder discussion from 2013 until 2016 under the lead of IFOAM - Organics International, the global organic umbrella. The process of its articulation has been supported by research and it became obvious that further strong research support is required to implement the Organic 3.0 strategies. This paper lays the foundation for deepened research and summarizes how the global organic movement sees its future developing under the title Organic 3.0, in which 1.0 marks the time of the organic pioneers and 2.0 the present situation and systems with certified organic agriculture that has an uptake of about 1% of global agriculture and food markets. Organic 3.0 aims at better contributing to solve challenges in the food chain such as healthy and affordable food for everyone, minimized environmental and food pollution, fairness for producers, high animal welfare, and efficiency in resource utilization.

Starting in 1993, experimentation with coffee agroforestry was gradually initiated on an increasing number of farms (37 in total), resulting in the simultaneous management of sun coffee (SC) and agroforestry coffee (AF) plots. We aimed (1) to identify factors that determine the farmers’ selection of trees used in AF; (2) to describe the agroecological farms in transition; and (3) to perform an economic comparison between AF and SC. These objectives were addressed by combining data from botanical surveys in 1993/1994 and 2007, by interviews with farmers and by detailed data on the production value and costs of labour and material inputs. The results showed considerable diversity in farming strategies and management among the farmers. Early adopters of AF had diversified towards production of different marketable products. The use of native trees in AF for this purpose, and for restoration of soil fertility (e.g., leguminous trees), had increased since the start of the experiments, while exotic tree species were eliminated. Over a period of 12 years AF was more profitable than SC due to the production of a diversity of agricultural goods, despite somewhat higher establishment costs. Other ecosystem services delivered by AF, such as biodiversity and cultural services are currently not valorized. Payment schemes for environmental services could further improve the economic benefits of AF for family farmers and alleviate establishment and learning costs.","Sustainable agriculture,Livelihood,Ecosystem services,Early adopter,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Agriculture,Umbrella species,Regional Red List,Red List Index,Species richness,Species distribution,Spatial distribution,Total human ecosystem,Social system,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Sustainability,Soil quality,Poverty,Water flow,Proxy (climate),Primary productivity,Sustainable forest management,Socioeconomics,Reforestation,Soil conservation,Soil carbon,Silvopasture,Metapopulation,Measurement of biodiversity,Livelihood,Tropics,Tree allometry,Forestry,Morelia,Latin Americans,Ecology","Helton Nonato de Souza,Jan de Graaff,Mirjam M.

976,Controlling variables and emission factors of methane from global rice fields,2018-01-01,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,10.5194/ACP-18-10419-2018,"Abstract. Rice cultivation has long been known as one of the dominant anthropogenic contributors to methane (CH4) emissions, yet there is still uncertainty when estimating its emissions at the global or regional scale. An increasing number of rice field measurements have been conducted globally, which allow us to reassess the major variables controlling CH4 emissions and develop region- and country-specific emission factors (EFs). The results of our statistical analysis show that the CH4 flux from rice fields was closely related to organic amendments, the water regime during and before the rice-growing season, soil properties and agroecological conditions. The average CH4 fluxes from fields with single and multiple drainage were 71 % and 55 % that of continuously flooded rice fields. The CH4 flux from fields that were flooded in the previous season were 2.4 and 2.7 times that of fields previously drained for a short and long season, respectively. Rice straw applied at 6 t ha−1 in the preseason can decrease CH4 emissions by half when compared to that applied shortly before rice transplanting. The global default EF was estimated to be 1.19 kg CH4 ha−1 day−1 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0.80 to 1.76 kg CH4 ha−1 day−1 for continuously flooded rice fields without organic amendment and with a preseason water status of short drainage. The lower EFs were found in countries from South Asia (0.85 kg CH4 ha−1 day−1) and North America (0.65 kg CH4 ha−1 day−1) relative to other regions, indicative of geographical variations at sub-regional and country levels. In conclusion, these findings can provide a sound basis for developing national inventories and mitigation strategies of CH4 emission from rice fields.","Transplanting,Paddy field,Methane,Flux (metallurgy),Flux,Drainage,Chemistry,Atmospheric sciences,Amendment,Agroecology,Methanogenesis,Methane,Greenhouse gas,Radiative forcing,Physics,Meteorology,Troposphere,Radiative forcing,Methane,Trend analysis,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Waterlogging (agriculture),Straw,Paddy field,Soil carbon,Potash,Paddy field,Spatial variability,Soil water,Soil texture,Paddy field,Methane,Hydrology,Phylogenetic tree,Methanogenesis,Methane,Unbalanced data,Statistics,Quadratic form","Jinyang Wang,Hiroko Akiyama,Kazuyuki Yagi,Xiaoyuan Yan,Ralph J.

However, current microarray data often feature multiple scores for a given tissue sample and antibody combination. Furthermore, an efficient and systematic method for combining scores that takes into account the differing staining properties of tissue epitopes has not been described. We thus present the TMA-Combiner, a new Microsoft Excel-based macro that permits analysis of data for which tissues may have two or more scores per antibody, and permits combination of data from multiple different tissue microarrays. It accomplishes this by rendering one score per tissue per antibody from two or more scores, using one of multiple user-selectable combination rules developed to account for the differing staining properties of tissue epitopes. This greatly facilitates analysis of tissue microarrays, particularly for users with large repositories of data, and may facilitate discovery of biological trends and help refine diagnostic accuracy of tissue markers in clinical samples.","Tissue microarray,Software tool,Software,Replicate,Rendering (computer graphics),Pathology,Microarray analysis techniques,Diagnostic accuracy,Data analysis,Computational biology,Biology,Bioinformatics,Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma,Tissue microarray,Pathology,Treatment decision making,Progesterone metabolism,Predictive value of tests,Tyrosine kinase,Tissue microarray,Stromal tumor,Tissue microarray,Survival analysis,Proteomics,Tumor suppressor gene,Mutation,Immunology,Tissue microarray,Prostate-specific antigen,Prostate cancer,Worksheet,Tissue microarray,Software,Trastuzumab,Mammary gland,Immunology,Univariate analysis,Tissue microarray,Pathology,Tissue microarray,Synovial sarcoma,Soft tissue","Chih Long Liu,Kelli D Montgomery,Yasodha Natkunam,Robert B West,Torsten O Nielsen,Maggie C U Cheang,Dmitry A Turbin,Robert J Marinelli,Matt van de Rijn,John P T Higgins,Torsten O.

To address low yields and low income both, the soil fertility, the agroecosystem functions, and the source of income can be restored by diversification with nitrogen-fixing trees and the cultivation of indigenous tree species that produce nutritious and marketable products. Biodiversity conservation studies indicate that mature cash crop systems, such as cacao and coffee with shade trees, provide wildlife habitat that supports natural predators, which, in turn, reduce the numbers of herbivores and pathogens. This review offers suggestions on how to examine these agroecological processes in more detail for the most effective rehabilitation of degraded land.

Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is performed to permit ABO-incompatible (ABO-I) kidney transplants, but little is known about how well TPE reduces ABO antibodies or complications related to TPE in this clinical setting. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated 46 individuals that received TPE to permit ABO-I kidney transplant. The number of TPE treatments was based on a goal ABO titer at the anti-human globulin (AHG) phase of 16 or less before surgery. RESULTS: Before TPE, the median titer of recipient was 32 (range, 2-128) at room temperature (RT) phase and 64 (range, 4-1024) at AHG phase. The first TPE reduced the total agglutination reactivity score at AHG phase by 10.2 percent. Before transplantation, there was a mean of 6.2 +/- 2.5 TPE treatments and total agglutination reactivity score at AHG phase was reduced by 53.5 percent. The median titer remained reduced at 3 to 6 months after transplantation at 4 (range, 0-64) at RT phase and 8 (range, 1-64) at AHG phase. TPE complications were minimal. During at least one procedure, 15 (32.6%) individuals had either urticaria or pruritus, 18 (39.1%) individuals experienced mild citrate-induced hypocalcemia, 5 (10.2%) individuals had hypotension, 6 (13.0%) individuals had nausea or vomiting, and 1 (2.2%) individual had West Nile virus encephalitis. CONCLUSIONS: With current infectious disease blood screening protocols, TPE has minimal complications and can reduce ABO antibody titers to permit ABO-I renal transplantation.","Vomiting,Transplantation,Titer,Medicine,Kidney transplantation,Kidney,Immunology,Diabetes mellitus,Antibody titer,ABO blood group system,Therapeutic apheresis,Modalities,Medicine,Surgery,Medicine,Inflammation,Urinary system,Transplantation,Surgery,Transplantation Conditioning,Transplantation,Splenectomy,Transplantation,Thrombotic microangiopathy,Staining,Urinary system,Population,Medicine,Transplantation,Single Center,Plasmapheresis,Transplantation Conditioning,Transplantation,Surgery,Tacrolimus,Regimen,Mycophenolic acid,Transplantation,Titer,Medicine","Aaron A.R.

982,The problems that exist when considering the anatomic variability between the channels that permit interventricular shunting.,2014-01-01,Cardiology in The Young,10.1017/S1047951114000869,": Although steps are being taken to produce a universally acceptable coding system for categorisation of the congenitally malformed hearts, obstacles remain in the search for consensus. One of the groups of lesions continuing to produce the greatest problems is those that permit interventricular shunting. The difficulties relate partly to the words used to describe the group itself, as those using Germanic languages describe the holes as ventricular septal defects, whereas those using Romance languages consider them to represent interventricular communications. The two terms, however, are not necessarily synonymous. Further disagreements relate to whether the lesions placed within the group should be sub-categorised on the basis of their geographical location within the ventricular mass, as opposed to the anatomic nature of their borders. In reality, attention to both the features is necessary if we are to recognise the full extent of phenotypic variability. In this review, we first review the evolution and theories of analysis naming the channels that permit interventricular shunting. We then demonstrate that embryologic techniques provide evidence that the changing morphology of the developing murine heart parallels the anatomy of the different lesions encountered in the congenitally malformed human heart. We suggest that, with attention paid to the temporal development of the normal murine heart, combined with a strict definition of the plane of separation between the right and left ventricular cavities, it will be feasible to produce a categorisation that is acceptable to all.","Ventricular mass,Shunting,Medicine,Internal medicine,Human heart,Cognitive psychology,Coding system,Cardiology,Cardiac anatomy,Anatomy,Vascular resistance,Surgery,Natural history,Physics,Nuclear magnetic resonance,Heart tube,Pharynx,Pathology,Outflow,Neuroscience,Imaging heart,High resolution,Pathology,Neural crest,Mesoderm,Ventricle,Tetralogy of Fallot,Tetralogy,Ventricle,Maldevelopment,Internal medicine,Trabecular septum,Radiography,Primary interatrial foramen,Ventricular outflow tract,Tricuspid valve,Trabecular septum,Medicine,Internal medicine,Diabetes mellitus","Frédérique Bailliard,Diane E.

In French Mediterranean mountainous areas, feeding patterns for sheep herds have been changing over the past decades in a manner which may not be favorable for agroecology. We hypothesize that labor plays a key role in this evolution. To test this hypothesis, we carried out observations and interviews, using the agrarian systems framework, with retired and active farmers in two areas of France. We built 7 sheep farm models and defined indicators assessing the contribution of different feed resources and the physical labor productivity in feed units in 1970 and 2013. The comparison of farm models highlights that herd growth has led to a focus on less labor-demanding feed resources, namely: (i) purchased feed in the Cevennes; (ii) meadows for single transhumance farms in the Alpine foothills; (iii) lowland winter grazing for double transhumance farms in the Alpine foothills. These changes are problematic from an agroecological perspective. This focus on labor offers a new perspective on changes in trajectories of livestock farming in the French Mediterranean region and serves as a basis for discussion on the importance of labor in agroecological transition.","Mediterranean climate,Livestock farming,Herd,Grazing,Foothills,Feeding patterns,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Economics,Agroecology,Agricultural economics,Agrarian society,Socio-ecological system,Regime shift,Psychological resilience,Power relations,Positive economics,Payment for ecosystem services,Sustainable development,Rural sociology,Politics,Natural resource economics,Land use,European union,Wood fuel,Sustainability,Soil conservation,Sustainable development,Resource management,Natural resource management,Valuation (finance),Sustainability,Public good,Vegetation,Reforestation,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Sustainable agriculture,Sociocultural evolution,Environmental resource management,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Smallholding","Claire Aubron,Laurent Noël,J.

985,Multi-functional landscapes from the grassroots? The role of rural producer movements,2016-01-01,Agriculture and Human Values,10.1007/S10460-015-9611-1,"Abstract Around the world, agricultural landscapes are increasingly seen as “multi-functional” spaces, expected to deliver food supplies while improving rural livelihoods and protecting and restoring healthy ecosystems. To support this array of functions and benefits, governments and civil society in many regions are now promoting integrated farm- and landscape-scale management strategies, in lieu of fragmented management strategies. While rural producers are fundamental to achieving multi-functional landscapes, they are frequently viewed as targets of, or barriers to, landscape-oriented initiatives, rather than as leading agents of change. In reality, however, rural producers in many areas have embraced elements of multi-functional land management. In this paper, we explore the role and recent evolution of producer movements in influencing multi-functional farm and landscape management. We explore these roles through six case studies, including a land reform movement in Brazil, indigenous territorial development in Bolivia, conservation agriculture associations in Canada, environmental cooperatives in the Netherlands, indigenous and biocultural heritage associations in Peru, and Landcare groups in the Philippines. These experiences suggest that producer movements are playing pivotal roles in supporting landscape multi-functionality, not only through agroecological farming practices but also through off-farm efforts to conserve ecosystems and support multi-stakeholder landscape planning. On the other hand, interests of producer movements are not always fully aligned with multi-functional landscape management approaches. The contribution of producer movements to multi-functional landscapes depends on these movements including farm and landscape stewardship in their values and goals, and having the political support and capacity to engage meaningfully in multi-stakeholder processes.","Livelihood,Landscape planning,Land reform,Land management,Indigenous,Grassroots,Environmental resource management,Economics,Civil society,Agroecology,Sociology,Social science,Social psychology,Sustainable agriculture,Soil conservation,Integrated pest management,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant,Sustainable development,Rural sociology,Politics,Water-use efficiency,Sustainability,Poverty,Zero Budget Farming,Natural farming,Mixed farming,Sociology,Soil carbon,Population,Life-cycle assessment,Sociology,Social movement,Criminology,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization","Abigail K.

Moreover, there is growing worldwide concern regarding the emission of greenhouse gases and their effect on our climate, which is directly related to the use of fossil energy. All this creates a need for energy studies on changing tendencies in the management of agricultural systems, among which we find that of organic farming. This article uses energy balances to evaluate the contribution of organic farming to the increase of energy efficiency in Spanish agriculture. To achieve this objective, comparative studies were carried out on 78 organic crops and their conventional counterparts. Primary data were obtained via direct surveys carried out at farms distributed across the whole of Spain.

Here we describe three primary strategies of agricultural intensification – conventional intensification, temporal intensification, and spatial intensification – and how they can be used to manage and integrate food and second-generation crop portfolios. While each strategy has individual merits, combining them to meet case-specific targets may achieve optimum results. Multiple experiments and examples from the USA and the EU illustrate the potential of combining these approaches for agroecological intensification that can provide ecosystem services while maintaining or increasing economic output, thus striking a balance between ‘land sparing’ and ‘land sharing’. Management strategies will vary by the types of markets available, e.g., food, fuel and/or ecosystem services, and the scale of markets supplied, e.g., small heat and power vs. large cellulosic ethanol.

988,Current situation and future prospects for beef production in Europe - A review.,2018-01-01,Asian-australasian Journal of Animal Sciences,10.5713/AJAS.18.0196,": The European Union (EU) is the world's third largest producer of beef. This contributes to the economy, rural development, social life, culture and gastronomy of Europe. The diversity of breeds, animal types (cows, bulls, steers, heifers) and farming systems (intensive, extensive on permanent or temporary pastures, mixed, breeders, feeders, etc) is a strength, and a weakness as the industry is often fragmented and poorly connected. There are also societal concerns regarding animal welfare and environmental issues, despite some positive environmental impacts of farming systems. The EU is amongst the most efficient for beef production as demonstrated by a relative low production of greenhouse gases. Due to regional differences in terms of climate, pasture availability, livestock practices and farms characteristics, productivity and incomes of beef producers vary widely across regions, being among the lowest of the agricultural systems. The beef industry is facing unprecedented challenges related to animal welfare, environmental impact, origin, authenticity, nutritional benefits and eating quality of beef. These may affect the whole industry, especially its farmers. It is therefore essential to bring the beef industry together to spread best practice and better exploit research to maintain and develop an economically viable and sustainable beef industry. Meeting consumers' expectations may be achieved by a better prediction of beef palatability using a modelling approach, such as in Australia. There is a need for accurate information and dissemination on the benefits and issues of beef for human health and for environmental impact. A better objective description of goods and services derived from livestock farming is also required. Putting into practice ""agroecology"" and organic farming principles are other potential avenues for the future. Different future scenarios can be written depending on the major driving forces, notably meat consumption, climate change, environmental policies and future organization of the supply chain.","Natural resource economics,Livestock,Goods and services,European union,Environmental impact assessment,Biology,Beef cattle,Animal welfare,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Prospect theory,Microeconomics,Mental accounting,Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics,Manure management,Livestock,Production chain,Preference behavior,Perception,Sustainability,Sociology of scientific knowledge,Point of sale,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Livestock,Sustainability,Strengths and weaknesses,Social psychology,Wheat gluten,Law,Food science,Polyunsaturated fatty acid,Lipolysis,Linolenic acid,World view,Willingness to pay,Supply chain,Preventive health,Health food,Food supply","Jean-François Hocquette,Marie-Pierre Ellies-Oury,Michel Lherm,Christele Pineau,Claus Deblitz,Linda Farmer,Richard H.

OBJECTIVES: To examine whether farmers will adopt varieties with a distinct visible trait, young children will eat OFSP in sufficient quantities to improve vitamin A intake, OFSP can serve as an entry point for promoting a more diversified diet, and lessons can be drawn to assure sustained adoption. METHODS: The 2-year quasi-experimental intervention study followed households and children (n = 741; mean age, 13 months at baseline) through two agricultural cycles in drought prone-areas of Mozambique. RESULTS: OFSP is acceptable to farmers when introduced by using an integrated approach. In the second year, intervention children (n = 498) were more likely than control children (n = 243) to have consumed OFSP (54% vs. 4%), dark-green leaves (60% vs. 46%), or ripe papaya (65% vs. 42%) on 3 or more days in the previous week (p < .001 for all comparisons). Their vitamin A intakes were nearly eight times higher than those of control children (median, 426 vs. 56 1g RAE [retinol activity equivalents], p < .001). Diet diversification was limited by difficult agroecological conditions and low purchasing power. However, dietary diversity was higher among intervention than control children (32% vs. 9% consuming food from more than four groups; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: An integrated OFSP-based approach had a positive impact on the vitamin A intake of young children. A market development component and improved vine multiplication systems are recommended to assure sustained adoption.","Vitamin A deficiency,Vitamin,Trait,Retinol,Orange (colour),Medicine,Food science,Crop,Biotechnology,Agroecology,Agriculture,Treatment evaluation,Psychology,Programme theory,Vitamin A deficiency,Vitamin,Retinol,Sustainable development,Socioeconomics,Rural area,Staple food,Psychological intervention,Plant breeding,Vitamin,Tubercle,Soluble solids,Postharvest,Orange (colour),Food science,Vitamin A deficiency,Psychological intervention,Primary component,Vitamin A intake,Vitamin A deficiency,Research methodology,Micronutrient,Malnutrition,Macro","Jan W.

I analyze how certain MST educational programs are based in a critical place-based pedagogy. This type of pedagogy can serve as a form of territoriality, influencing individuals’ interactions with the land. Drawing upon a political ecology of education perspective, I conclude that MST educators can serve as Gramscian ‘organic intellectuals’, by using a critical pedagogy of place as a form of territoriality to: (1) create a conception of place that is not discrete, but instead relational, and (2) advocate counter-hegemonic land usage.","Territoriality,Sociology,Social science,Political ecology,Critical pedagogy,Agroecology,Sociology,Social science,Social pedagogy,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant,Sociology,Social science,Social reproduction,International trade,Human rights,Food sovereignty,Transformative learning,Psychology,Personal perspectives,Sociology,Prison,Criminology,Social movement,Social mobilization,Politics,Territoriality,Sociology,Anthropology,Sociology of Education,Sociology,Social science,Geography,Genealogy,Ethnology","David Meek,David A.

999,Contribution of organic farming to public goods in Denmark,2017-01-01,Organic agriculture,10.1007/S13165-017-0193-7,"The potential contribution of organic farming to the public goods, ‘Nature and Biodiversity’, ‘Environment’, ‘Energy and Climate’, ‘Human Health and Welfare’ and ‘Animal Health and Welfare’ in Denmark is guided and partly secured by the principles and specific requirements of the EU Organic Regulation. However, other factors, such as the production type, farm size, geographical location and—not the least—the management of the farm, also influence the contribution. Using the ban on synthetic pesticides and restricted use of antibiotics, including the requirements to compensate for and prevent such uses in organic farming, as examples, the positive and negative contributions of organic farming in relation to selected public goods were analysed. The contributions of organic farming to Nature and Biodiversity and Human and Animal Health and Welfare are mainly positive compared to conventional farming for all farm types, whilst the effects on Environment and Energy and Climate are mixed; i.e. some effects are positive and others are negative. The analysis revealed a need for further documentation and revision of the organic principles and specific organic requirements— in particular in relation to the public goods Energy and Climate, which at present are not addressed in the EU Organic Regulation. Moreover, some organic farming requirements and practices cause dilemmas; e.g. more space per animal and outdoor access improves Animal Health and Welfare but at the same time has negative effects on Environment, Energy Consumption and Climate Change. These dilemmas should be solved before OA may be fully attractive as an integrated policy measure supporting jointly several public goods objectives.","Welfare,Sustainable development,Public good,Organic farming,Natural resource economics,Intensive farming,Environmental resource management,Ecological farming,Business,Agroecology,Agriculture,Computer science,Computer network,Urbanization,Sustainability,Public health,Sustainability,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Species richness,Population density,Organic farming,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Toxicology testing,Toxicology,Risk assessment,Risk assessment,Pesticide,Invertebrate,Soil organic matter,Organic farming,Nutrient management,Species richness,Organic farming,Land use,Species richness,Species evenness,Species diversity","Lizzie Melby Jespersen,Dorte Lau Baggesen,Erik Fog,Kirsten Halsnæs,John Erik Hermansen,Lise Andreasen,Beate Strandberg,Jan Tind Sørensen,Niels Halberg,David J.

1000,The role of coffee agroforestry in the conservation of tree diversity and community composition of native forests in a Biosphere Reserve,2014-01-01,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",10.1016/J.AGEE.2014.03.024,"Agroforestry is considered a promising alternative to conventional agriculture that can both conserve biodiversity and support local livelihoods. Coffee agroforestry may be particularly important for sustaining trees of conservation concern and late-successional stage, but this possibility remains unclear. Here, we examined whether coffee agroforestry systems can serve as conservation reservoirs of tree species native to nearby forests. We compared tree diversity, composition and structure between coffee agroforests and forests in La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico. We found that, although at the landscape level the full set of coffee agroforests appears to conserve comparable tree species richness to nearby native forests, the species composition that is being conserved is different. Coffee agroforests had a lower proportion of trees of conservation concern, a higher proportion of pioneer trees, were dominated by Inga spp., harbored lower tree species diversity at the plot level, and were composed of different tree species compared to native forests. We suggest that conservation practitioners and policy makers seeking to promote coffee agroforestry as a conservation strategy should consider how such agroforestry systems differ in species diversity and composition from the native forests of conservation interest. Further, promoting different coffee agroforest management strategies, such as discouraging the replacement of diverse agroforest canopies with Inga-dominated canopies, would help improve the conservation value of coffee agroforests through more sustainable practices.","Species richness,Species diversity,Livelihood,Inga,Biosphere,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Regional Red List,Red List Index,Not evaluated,Umbrella species,Regional Red List,Red List Index,Statistical model,Spatial analysis,Simple linear regression,Taxon,Species richness,Species diversity,Statistical hypothesis testing,Statistical assumption,Ordination,Species richness,Species diversity,Species discovery curve,Vegetation,Temperate climate,Species richness,Tropics,Rainforest,Nature reserve,Environmental resource management,Environmental impact assessment,Crop production,Tree diversity,Software,Geography","Vivian Valencia,Luis García-Barrios,Paige West,Eleanor J.

However, to date, methods for using existing statistical data to assess the emissions of the construction sector and to make decisions affecting permit allocation are still unclear. In this context, a process is proposed in this study to calculate the life-cycle emissions of regional construction sectors in China, and a multi-criteria Gini coefficient is introduced as an indicator for emission permit allocation. Statistical data of the construction sector for 2004–2013 were analyzed. The results indicated an overall trend of increased emissions from China’s construction sector, of which the production phase of buildings was shown to be the largest contributor. Various characteristics for different life-cycle sub-processes were also discussed at the provincial level. Finally, a case study of emissions from the construction sector was conducted on the basis of a multi-criteria Gini coefficient. Relevant analyses revealed the major regions in carbon reduction practices from a comprehensive view of efficiency and equality.

1002,Diagnosis of nutrient imbalances with vector analysis in agroforestry systems.,2011-01-01,Journal of Environmental Quality,10.2134/JEQ2010.0144,": Agricultural intensification has had unintended environmental consequences, including increased nutrient leaching and surface runoff and other agrarian-derived pollutants. Improved diagnosis of on-farm nutrient dynamics will have the advantage of increasing yields and will diminish financial and environmental costs. To achieve this, a management support system that allows for site-specific rapid evaluation of nutrient production imbalances and subsequent management prescriptions is needed for agroecological design. Vector diagnosis, a bivariate model to depict changes in yield and nutritional response simultaneously in a single graph, facilitates identification of nutritional status such as growth dilution, deficiency, sufficiency, luxury uptake, and toxicity. Quantitative data from cocoa agroforestry systems and pigeonpea intercropping trials in Ghana and Tanzania, respectively, were re-evaluated with vector analysis. Relative to monoculture, biomass increase in cocoa ( L.) under shade (35-80%) was accompanied by a 17 to 25% decline in P concentration, the most limiting nutrient on this site. Similarly, increasing biomass with declining P concentrations was noted for pigeonpea [ (L). Millsp.] in response to soil moisture availability under intercropping. Although vector analysis depicted nutrient responses, the current vector model does not consider non-nutrient resource effects on growth, such as ameliorated light and soil moisture, which were particularly active in these systems. We revisit and develop vector analysis into a framework for diagnosing nutrient and non-nutrient interactions in agroforestry systems. Such a diagnostic technique advances management decision-making by increasing nutrient precision and reducing environmental issues associated with agrarian-derived soil contamination.","Water content,Surface runoff,Soil contamination,Nutrient,Monoculture,Intercropping,Chemistry,Biomass,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Intercropping,Geography,Facilitation,Shoot,Photosynthesis,Nutrient,Water resources,Nutrient management,Nutrient cycle,Temperate climate,Research areas,Operational approach,Temperate climate,Sustainable agriculture,Soil carbon,Water conservation,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Surface runoff,Soil conservation,Nonpoint source pollution,Intercropping,Biology,Agroforestry,Natural resource management,Intercropping,Biology","Marney E.

These two concerns, however, may conflict in a dynamic setting. Anticipating the regulator's future desire to give more permits to firms that appear to need them, firms purchase permits to signal their need. This raises the price above marginal costs and the market becomes inefficient. If the social cost of pollution is high and the government intervenes frequently in the market, the distortions are greater than the gains from trade and non-tradable permits are better.

1004,"Towards an Agroecology of Knowledges: Recognition, Cognitive Justice and Farmers’ autonomy in France.",2016-01-01,Journal of Rural Studies,10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2016.07.012,"Abstract Most collective agroecological initiatives in Europe today are built around a plurality of knowledge systems. Going beyond the well-documented instrumental goals of this knowledge-plurality, this paper highlights another, perhaps less obvious objective: the pursuit of recognition and cognitive justice. The subordination of alternative farming practices, such as agroecology, to industrial high-input farming leads to the misrecognition of peasant communities. Challenging industrial agriculture hence requires both equality between different forms of doing farming and an active engagement with different ways of knowing farming. Cognitive justice, a concept originating in decolonial thought, encompasses not only the right of different practices to co-exist, but entails an active engagement across their knowledge-systems. Using an example of participatory maize breeding in France, the paper illustrates how peasant movements in Europe organize an ’agroecology of knowledges’, a counter-hegemonic engagement with modern agronomic science, through the recovery and co-production of situational, environment-specific knowledge, and the reskilling of farmers. It aims not only at improving agricultural science, but also at rebuilding collective identities and reclaiming autonomy.","Sociology,Socioeconomics,Situational ethics,Peasant,Intensive farming,Collective identity,Citizen journalism,Autonomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sociology,Social studies,Social science,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Redistribution (cultural anthropology),Political science,Political economy,Sociology,Social science,Redistribution (cultural anthropology),Sociology,Environmental ethics,Redistribution (cultural anthropology),Politics,Political science,Natural resource economics,Liberian dollar,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Sociology,Religious studies,Redistribution (cultural anthropology),Sustainable development,Rural sociology,Politics,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture","Brendan Coolsaet,Alexander L.

The research approaches taken by these systems explicitly or implicitly seek simple, one-size-fits-all solutions for problems and opportunities that are extremely diverse. Radical change is needed to facilitate the agroecological intensification of smallholder farming. We propose that large-scale participatory approaches, combined with innovations in information and communications technology (ICT), could enable the effective matching of diverse options to the wide spectrum of socio-ecological context that characterize smallholder agriculture. We consider the requirements, precedents and issues that might be involved in the development of farmer research networks (FRNs). Substantial institutional innovation will be needed to support FRNs, with shifts in roles and relationships amongst researchers, extension providers and farmers. Where farmers’ organizations have social capital and strong facilitation skills, such alignments may be most feasible. Novel information management capabilities will be required to introduce options and principles, enable characterization of contexts, manage data related to option-by-context interactions and enable farmers to visualize their findings in useful and intelligible ways. FRNs could lead to vastly greater capacity for technical innovation, which could in turn enable greater productivity and resilience, and enhance the quality of rural life.","Social capital,Rural area,Psychological resilience,Information management,Information and Communications Technology,Citizen journalism,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Transformational leadership,Sustainable development,Sustainability science,World Wide Web,Systems architecture,Server,Sustainability,Precision agriculture,Information system,Sustainability,Mobile phone,Mobile payment,Sustainable agriculture,Literature survey,Ecosystem services,Systems medicine,Systems biology,Social network,Soil conservation,Scarcity,Population,Soil type,Soil quality,Soil organic matter,Trait,Resource allocation,Plant breeding,Poverty,Plant breeding,Famine","Rebecca Nelson,Richard Coe,Bettina I.

A challenge to farmer uptake is high spatial and temporal variability in cover crop growth and performance. Since topography plays an important role in spatial processes that ultimately affect plant performance, it could be used to quantify cover crop spatial variability and cover crop contribution to a subsequent cash crop. We assessed the effects of topography and cover crop (red clover) biomass on corn yields. Hierarchical path analysis was used to identify direct and indirect relationships among topography, red clover biomass, and corn yield, while taking into account the effects of agricultural management practices, multiple years, and multiple experimental fields. We observed that topography contribute significantly to explaining the variability in both red clover biomass and corn yields. Higher red clover biomass was produced in flat areas, whereas higher corn yield was produced in areas with high curvature. Red clover biomass positively influenced corn yield, however, the magnitude of that effect varied both temporally and spatially. The effect of red clover on corn yields was significant only in the years with lowest precipitation; and its magnitude was more pronounced at summit and slope topographical positions. Therefore, a good cover crop stand will be most beneficial to subsequent corn crop at summit and slope positions. Accounting for variability in fields and years using a hierarchical model significantly improved analysis of the interactive relationships between topography, red clover, and corn; therefore we encouraged its use in agroecological research.","Spatial variability,Red Clover,Precipitation,Software engineering,Software analytics,Reference software,Statistical analyses,Data set,Data science,Variable-order Bayesian network,Probabilistic programming language,Markov chain,Regression analysis,Proper linear model,Polynomial regression,Model complexity,Engineering,Econometrics,Variogram,Statistics,Spatial ecology,Software,Programming language,Probabilistic programming language,Statistics,Spatial variability,Spatial descriptive statistics,Statistics,Computer science,Naive Bayes classifier,Machine learning,Inductive probability","Juan D.

The horticultural practices of the Jodi were previously characterized as 'incipient cultivation' but such practices were poorly described and documented. The antiquity of cultivation among this group is suggested by the prominence and significance of horticultural products and techniques in myth and ritual. Our field observations uncovered a fairly sophisticated system of plant management in swiddens, house gardens, trail gardens and natural forest gaps. An inventory of 67 cultivated plant species was documented, of which 36 are utilized for food, 20 for magical or medicinal purposes, and 11 for technology. The Jodi prolong the productive phase of their gardens for five years or more through successive planting-harvesting-replanting operations. Jodi swiddens display an elaborate polycultivated appearance and they possess at least five principal crops: plantain/banana, maize, yams, sweet potato, and sweet manioc. Another distinctive feature is the extensive use of natural gaps in the forest canopy as cultivation zones. The results of this study suggest that while Jodi horticultural practice is well integrated with a nomadic, foraging-dependent lifestyle, nevertheless this system does not deserve to be labeled as 'incipient' and instead is more integral than was recognized previously.","Tree canopy,Plant species,Plant management,Natural forest,Myth and ritual,Environmental protection,Ecology,Crop,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Sociology,Statistics,Social psychology,Social group,Species richness,Sapotaceae,Phytosociology,Sociology,Silence,Perspectivism,Time allocation,Sociology,Social science,Tropical forest,Polyculture,Monoculture,Vernacular,Toponymy,Territoriality,Subsistence agriculture,Socioeconomics,Population,Sociology,Sociality,Social organization,The Symbolic,Subsistence agriculture,Sociology","Stanford Zent,Egleé Zent,Marcel Mauss,Florence R.

1009,Ratooning and perennial staple crops in Malawi. A review,2016-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-016-0384-8,"The management of staple crops as perennials is a historic legacy and a present-day strategy in some regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, yet perenniality is rarely an agronomic subject. Farmers in Malawi cut annual crops, such as pigeonpea and sorghum, to extend production for more than one growing season. Cassava, a perennial food crop, has a proven track record of abating hunger. Here we review ratooning, as well as the historic role of perennial staple crops in Malawi. Ratooning is a method of harvesting a crop which leaves the roots and the lower parts of the plant uncut to give the ratoon or the stubble crop. This review is completed with interviews with Malawian farmers. The major points follow. The management of staple crops as perennials is underserved by research. Indeed, we retrieved only 86 references on ratooning sorghum and pigeonpea. Of these, 9 % and 19 % respectively were from the African continent. The literature and interviews indicate that pigeonpea and sorghum have high productive potential when well managed in ratoon systems. Thirty-five percent of interviewee responses that supported ratooning mentioned saving seed. Other primary reasons to ratoon include stimulating regrowth (30 %) and saving labor (20 %). However, 31 % of responses that were against ratooning cited increased disease potential, as well as excessive vegetative regrowth (18 %).","Sorghum,Ratooning,Perennial plant,Growing season,Crop,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant,Standard of living,Species richness,Species evenness,Tannin,Sorghum,Proanthocyanidin,Sustainable agriculture,Monoculture,Green Revolution,Sustainable agriculture,Sociocultural evolution,Environmental resource management,Sustainability,Soil conservation,Profitability index,Tanzania,Social capital,Resource constraints,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Scientific method,Sustainable agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Food security,Total factor productivity,Per capita income,Mortality rate","Paul Rogé,Sieglinde Snapp,Mayamiko Nathaniel Kakwera,Leah Mungai,Isaac Jambo,Brad Peter,Miguel A.

Integrating trees and agriculture through agroforestry has been attracting increasing interest as an agroecological approach to sustainable intensification. Trees have traditionally been important elements of temperate agricultural systems around the world, but there has been increasing separation of agriculture, forestry and nature over the past few decades. This paper discusses what we can learn from traditional agroforestry systems to help develop modern systems that integrate ecological farming and agroecological advances to achieve sustainable intensification.

1011,Pathways to agroecological intensification of soil fertility management by smallholder farmers in the Andean highlands,2011-01-01,Advances in Agronomy,10.1016/B978-0-12-394277-7.00004-X,"Abstract Small farmers in the high Andes (> 2500 m) of Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru face increasing threats to their livelihoods due to land degradation, climate change, and overall decreases in agricultural productivity. The fragile nature of these agroecosystems and limited capacity of resource-poor farmers in the region to adopt the large-scale use of conventional fertilizer and pest control technologies suggest the need for agroecological intensification to restore soil functioning and ensure long-term sustainability in these systems. This review addresses soil fertility decline from a management perspective and considers six basic approaches to enhance nutrient cycling, crop nutrient acquisition, and long-term productivity. A mass balance approach first defines basic boundaries for nutrient cycling and suggests that erosion control and identification of alternative nutrient sources (e.g., peri-urban wastes, rock phosphate) are critical for reversing negative nutrient budgets. Meanwhile, short-term nutrient dynamics could benefit greatly from improved management of organic residues in combination with low-level inorganic fertilizer applications. There is also a need for greater understanding of soil physiochemical properties throughout much of the Andes and the impacts of management. Similarly, soil biological functioning is critical for successful agroecological intensification and there is great potential for both inoculative and management strategies to promote beneficial soil communities. Crop breeding for smallholder environments should complement strategies of agroecological intensification, taking advantage of high regional agrobiodiversity and experience from stress breeding programs in other regions. Finally, we suggest several means by which the spatial and temporal organization of farms may be improved to enhance overall agroecosystem function.","Soil management,Soil fertility,Nutrient management,Land degradation,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural biodiversity,Weather station,Spatial variability,Spatial ecology,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination management,Soil respiration,Soil carbon,Permafrost carbon cycle,Soil water,Soil structure,Soil science,Soil science,Soil quality,Soil organic matter,Soil fertility,Nutrient management,Nutrient cycle,Woodland,Sclerophyll,Myrtaceae,Photoprotection,Metabolomics,Genomics,Soil water,Soil structure,Soil organic matter,Soil science,Soil pH,Soil organic matter","Steven J.

It asserts that the challenge of agricultural sustainability can be fruitfully addressed within an analytical framework that consciously and explicitly considers agricultural development as consisting of processes of coevolution involving agriculture and the surrounding ecological and socioeconomic systems. Widening the processes to include strong interconnectedness with national and global systems with respect to off-farm resources and farm outputs has led to various agro-ecological problems. Strengthening local interaction and interconnectedness in a rural-urban context is found to be essential for developing a system of sustainable agriculture. Such development requires influencing many subsystems and implementing changes in production methods and land use as short-term responses to the problem, and technological development, resource allocation and changes in values as long-term responses. It also requires some sustainability principles and indicators in order to direct actions and to facilitate communications, which can be derived from the model. Applying the model on Swedish agricultural sustainability during the twentieth century reveals some, probably, important findings for ""building"" sustainable agriculture and lends support to the usefulness of the model.","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Resource allocation,Land use,Interconnectedness,Environmental resource management,Environmental history,Economics,Agroecology,Agriculture,Weak and strong sustainability,Sustainable development,Sustainability science,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Social ecology,Geography,Weak and strong sustainability,Pollution,Natural resource economics,Wildness,Uneconomic growth,Population,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Personal consumption expenditures price index,Trustworthiness,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Geography,Spite,Publication,Positive economics,Transformity,Sustainability,Renewable energy","Basim Saifi,Lars Drake,Gro Harlem Brundtland,Mansour Khalid,Fikret Berkes,Carl Folke,Johan Colding,Jared Diamond,David William Pearce,R.

After exploring the current situation, students can step down the learning ladder to acquire additional needed information and skills. Next they explore the links between theory and application, and we provide a safe space to experiment with putting knowledge into directed action. To help clients plan for a desirable future in farming and food systems, students step up the learning ladder to practice their ability to think creatively about the future, and then to evaluate the expected impacts and potential implications of alternative scenarios. Underlying the learning of skills, principles, and methods for action are the internal values and attitudes that will motivate and drive students in their future work.

The objective of our work was to understand how alternative farmers build their strategic choices. Through a multiple-case qualitative study of 14 organic market gardening microfarms in the northern half of France, we developed a systemic conceptual framework in which strategic decision making is integrated with a wide range of social and environmental aspirations. As these various aspirations can be in tension, it is relevant to consider tradeoffs between them to study the viability of alternative farms.","Welfare,Strategic decision making,Qualitative research,Profit maximization,Permaculture,Environmental resource management,Environmental economics,Economics,Conceptual framework,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sociology,Single-subject design,Organizational Case Studies,Qualitative content analysis,Phenomenon,Palliative care,Social venture,Social science,Perception,Social psychology,Skepticism,Psychology,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Scholarship,Sociology,Measuring economic worth over time,Macroeconomics,Sociology,Qualitative research,Pedagogy,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Natural capital,Politics,Point of departure,Neoliberalism","Kevin Morel,François Léger,Robert K.

1016,Life cycle analysis reveals higher agroecological benefits of organic and low-input apple production,2013-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1007/S13593-012-0124-7,"Conventional agricultural systems depend on high inputs of fertilizers and toxic pesticides that are a threat for human health and the environment. Such issues are rapidly changing agriculture in Europe. As a consequence sustainable production systems are currently developed as safer alternatives, for instance organic and low-input systems use of mechanical and biological methods versus toxic substances. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the overall impact of these alternative systems on toxicity, energy use, and global warming, notably for perennial crops such as apple orchards, which require the control of many pests. Here we present the first analysis of the environmental impacts of nine apple orchard systems using life cycle analysis. We used data from a survey of apple orchard systems located in Southern France, covering 2006–2009. Conventional, low-input, and organic orchards were planted with three apple cultivars differing in their disease susceptibility, hence designing nine apple systems, with the Golden Delicious conventional system being considered as the reference. Our results show that low-input systems planted with low disease susceptibility Melrose cultivar decreased environmental impacts by 6–99 %. Organic systems had one of the highest impacts per mass unit due to low yields, but showed low impacts per area unit planted with low-susceptibility cultivars generally. Potential toxicity was decreased by 2–40 % for human, 71–82 % for aquatic life, and 97–99 % for terrestrial life using mechanical control versus toxic pesticides to control weeds and diseases.","Sustainable development,Pesticide,Orchard,Life-cycle assessment,Cultivar,Biology,Aquatic ecosystem,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Regional science,Environmental science,Cross sectoral,Physical science,Environmental science,Climatology,Life-cycle assessment,Iso standards,Environmental science,Environmental science,Agricultural productivity,Agricultural economics,Soil organic matter,Organic farming,Nutrient management,Tillage,Soil science,Soil carbon,Water quality,Organic farming,Intensive farming,Organic product,Organic farming,Manure management,Life-cycle assessment,Integrated farming,Environmental planning,Organic matter,Organic farming,Nitrate","Aude Alaphilippe,Sylvaine Simon,Laurent Brun,Frank Hayer,Gérard Gaillard,Terry Barker,Igor Bashmakov,Awwad Alharthi,Markus Ammann,Luis Cifuentes,Adrian Moser,Jeroen B.

1017,Greenhouse gas fluxes from agricultural soils of Kenya and Tanzania,2016-01-01,Journal of Geophysical Research,10.1002/2016JG003341,"Knowledge of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in soils is a prerequisite to constrain national, continental, and global GHG budgets. However, data characterizing fluxes from agricultural soils of Africa are markedly limited. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) fluxes at 10 farmer-managed sites of six crop types for 1 year in Kenya and Tanzania using static chambers and gas chromatography. Cumulative emissions ranged between 3.5–15.9 Mg CO2-C ha−1 yr−1, 0.4–3.9 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1, and −1.2–10.1 kg CH4-C ha−1 yr−1, depending on crop type, environmental conditions, and management. Manure inputs increased CO2 (p = 0.03), but not N2O or CH4, emissions. Soil cultivation had no discernable effect on emissions of any of the three gases. Fluxes of CO2 and N2O were 54–208% greater (p < 0.05) during the wet versus the dry seasons for some, but not all, crop types. The heterogeneity and seasonality of fluxes suggest that the available data describing soil fluxes in Africa, based on measurements of limited duration of only a few crop types and agroecological zones, are inadequate to use as a basis for estimating the impact of agricultural soils on GHG budgets. A targeted effort to understand the magnitude and mechanisms underlying African agricultural soil fluxes is necessary to accurately estimate the influence of this source on the global climate system and for determining mitigation strategies.","Soil water,Seasonality,Manure,Greenhouse gas,Geology,Climate change,Carbon dioxide,Atmospheric sciences,Agroecology,Agriculture,Urbanization,Sustainability,Public health,Manure management,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Wetland methane emissions,Methane,Greenhouse gas,Soil water,Nitrogen cycle,Microsite,World Ocean Circulation Experiment,Sampling (statistics),Oceanography,Tillage,Soil organic matter,Population,Soil carbon,Peat,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Vegetation type,Vegetation,Soil water,Soil water,Ozone layer,Nitrous oxide,Reactive nitrogen,Nitrous oxide,Nitrogen cycle","Todd S.

1019,Farmer perception and utilization of leaf functional traits in managing agroecosystems,2017-01-01,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/1365-2664.13027,"Using knowledge of leaf functional traits, such as those forming the leaf economics spectrum (LES), to understand plant responses to environmental change is well-established and now being more widely applied to agroecosystems. Yet, little is known about how farm managers invoke leaf functional traits to inform management decisions. The objectives of this research were to (1) evaluate whether farmers use knowledge of intraspecific trait variation (ITV) in LES traits (or trait proxies) of target crops as response indicators of management conditions; (2) determine whether LES trait values are ranked consistently among multiple farmers along a “Farmer Leaf Economics Spectrum” (FES); (3) evaluate how a FES corresponds to the LES; and (4) identify the farmer and farm attributes that best predict the agreement between the FES and the LES. We collaborated with coffee (Coffea arabica) farmers in the Turrialba Valley, Costa Rica. We used a visual elicitation tool of fresh leaves along an intraspecific spectrum of leaf size, leaf thickness and leaf colour (as a proxy for leaf nutrients); respondents were asked to rank leaves in response to shade and nutrient scenarios as well as yield potential. On-farm biophysical data, management practices and socio-economic attributes were also collected. The majority of farmers demonstrated a developed system of utilizing coffee leaf and whole-plant ITV as indicators of management practices. Farmers managing smaller farms tended to more commonly acknowledge ITV in LES chemical–morphological traits, as compared to those managing large farms. The agreement between a respondent-identified ranking of leaf thickness ITV as a function of light environment and an empirically defined thickness-to-light ranking was partially explained by farmers’ physical engagement with plants. Synthesis and applications. In scientific literature, analyses of crop intraspecific trait variation have provided important insights into the mechanistic bases of multiple key agroecological processes. We demonstrate that farmers use crop leaf trait variation as an indicator to both evaluate management prescriptions and to initiate management actions including shade-tree species selection and abundance, crop- and shade-tree pruning regimes and fertilization treatments. These findings signify that functional traits represent a key nexus between scientific and local knowledge.","Trait,Ranking,Pruning,Leaf size,Intraspecific competition,Ecology,Crop,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Visualization,Public domain,Pixel,Vegetation,Trait,Specific leaf area,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Trophic level,Trait,Plant species,Tree species,Taxon,Secondary chemistry,Trait,Taxon,Resource Acquisition Is Initialization,Plant strategies,Plant development,Plant Physiological Phenomena,Trait,Terminology,Plant traits,Slow response,Plant ecology,Longevity,Plant development,Molecular genetics,Genomics of domestication","Marney E.

1020,Concepts of Animal Health and Welfare in Organic Livestock Systems,2012-01-01,Journal of Agricultural & Environmental Ethics,10.1007/S10806-011-9314-6,"In 2005, The International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements (IFOAM) developed four new ethical principles of organic agriculture to guide its future development: the principles of health, ecology, care, and fairness. The key distinctive concept of animal welfare in organic agriculture combines naturalness and human care, and can be linked meaningfully with these principles. In practice, a number of challenges are connected with making organic livestock systems work. These challenges are particularly dominant in immature agro-ecological systems, for example those that are characterized by industrialization and monoculture. Some of the current challenges are partly created by shortages of land and manure, which encourage zero-grazing and other confined systems. Other challenges are created in part by the conditions for farming and the way in which global food distribution systems are organized, e.g., how live animals are transported, how feed is traded and transported all over the globe, and the development of infrastructure and large herds. We find that the overall organic principles should be included when formulating guidelines for practical organic animal farming. This article explores how the special organic conceptions of animal welfare are related to the overall principles of organic agriculture. The aim is to identify potential routes for future development of organic livestock systems in different contexts and with reference to the specific understanding of animal welfare in organic agriculture. We include two contrasting cases represented by organic livestock systems in northwestern Europe and farming systems in tropical low-income countries; we use these cases to explore the widely different challenges of organic livestock systems in different parts of the world.","Principles of Organic Agriculture,Organic farming,Natural resource economics,Monoculture,Livestock,Food distribution,Environmental resource management,Economics,Biotechnology,Animal welfare,Agroecology,Agriculture,Water scarcity,Water resources,Livestock,Shadow,Natural resource economics,Medicine,Sustainability,Small farm,Rural area,World population,Sustainability,Social Welfare,Willingness to pay,Social desirability bias,Organic product,Welfare,Quality assurance,Organic farming,Veterinary medicine,Social psychology,Scientific method,Poverty,Population,Geography,Stakeholder,Principles of Organic Agriculture,Organic farming,Subsidy,Organic product,Organic farming","Mette Vaarst,Hugo Fjelsted Alrøe,H.

Drawing upon a political ecology of health conceptual framework, the paper explores whether and how participatory agroecological farming can improve food security and nutrition among HIV-affected households. In-depth interviews were conducted with 27 farmers in HIV-affected households in the area near Ekwendeni Trading Centre in northern Malawi. The results show that participatory agroecological farming has a strong potential to meet the food, dietary, labour and income needs of HIV-affected households, whilst helping them to manage natural resources sustainably. As well, the findings reveal that place-based politics, especially gendered power imbalances, are imperative for understanding the human impacts of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Overall, the study adds valuable insights into the literature on the human-environment dimensions of health. It demonstrates that the onset of disease can radically transform the social relations governing access to and control over resources (e.g., land, labour, and capital), and that these altered social relations in turn affect sustainable disease management. The conclusion highlights how the promotion of sustainable agroecology could help to partly address the socio-ecological challenges associated with HIV/AIDS.","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Socioeconomics,Political ecology,Participatory action research,Natural resource,Medicine,Food security,Economic growth,Agroecology,Agriculture,Qualitative research,Psychology,Management science,Geography,Food insecurity,Environmental health,Medicine,Health survey,Environmental health,Research design,Qualitative research,Part iii,Sustainable development,Peasant,Food sovereignty,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Food systems,Sociology,Social science,Research methodology,Risk factor,Public health,Population,Sustainable agriculture,Monoculture,Green Revolution,Subsidy,Socioeconomics,Policy simulations","Hanson Nyantakyi-Frimpong,Faith Nankasa Mambulu,Rachel Bezner Kerr,Isaac Luginaah,Esther Lupafya,Michael Quinn Patton,Jennifer Coates,Anne Swindale,Paula Bilinsky,Malawi,Matthew B.

Despite its multitude of definitions, agroecology has begun in Europe to develop in different regional, national and continental networks of researchers, practitioners, advocates and movements. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview about these different developments and networks. Therefore, this paper attempts to document and provide a mapping of the development of European agroecology in its diverse forms. Through a literature review, interviews, active conference participation, and an extensive internet search we have collected information about the current state and development of agroecology in Europe. Agroecological research and higher education exist more in western and northern Europe, but farm schools and farmer-to-farmer training are also present in other regions. Today a large variety of topics are studied at research institutions. There is an increasing number of bottom-up agroecological initiatives and national or continental networks and movements. Important movements are around food sovereignty, access to land and seeds. Except for France, there are very few concrete policies for agroecology in Europe. Agroecology is increasingly linked to different fields of agri-food systems. This includes Community Supported Agriculture systems, but also agroecological territories, and some examples of labelling products. To amplify agroecology in Europe in the coming years, policy development will be crucial and proponents of agroecology must join forces and work hand-in-hand with the many stakeholders engaged in initiatives to develop more sustainable agriculture and food systems.","Sustainable agriculture,Regional science,Political movement,Higher education,Food systems,Food sovereignty,Environmental resource management,Economics,Collective action,Agroecology,Agricultural policy,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Systems thinking,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Organic farming","Alexander Wezel,Julia Goette,Elisabeth Lagneaux,Gloria Passuello,A.

Moreover, the agronomic–urban interface is growing, as are markets for ecologically friendly produce, the need for low-input farming systems in low-income regions, and disenchantment with the subsidization of conventional agriculture. There is reasonable biological and economic evidence to support advocacy for a shift to regenerative systems. Such a shift presents challenges—for example, although higher labor input enhances community well-being and rural social capital, it is costly. It also offers opportunities—for example, to adapt technologies to monitor and minimize wastage.

1024,Microglia permit climbing fiber elimination by promoting GABAergic inhibition in the developing cerebellum.,2018-01-01,Nature Communications,10.1038/S41467-018-05100-Z,"Circuit refinement during postnatal development is finely regulated by neuron–neuron interactions. Recent studies suggest participation of microglia in this process but it is unclear how microglia cooperatively act with neuronal mechanisms. To examine roles of microglia, we ablate microglia by microglia-selective deletion of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (Csf1r) by crossing floxed-Csf1r and Iba1-iCre mice (Csf1r-cKO). In Csf1r-cKO mice, refinement of climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell (PC) innervation after postnatal day 10 (P10)–P12 is severely impaired. However, there is no clear morphological evidence suggesting massive engulfment of CFs by microglia. In Csf1r-cKO mice, inhibitory synaptic transmission is impaired and CF elimination is restored by diazepam, which suggests that impairment of CF elimination is caused by a defect of GABAergic inhibition on PCs, a prerequisite for CF elimination. These results indicate that microglia primarily promote GABAergic inhibition and secondarily facilitate the mechanism for CF elimination inherent in PCs. In the mammalian cerebellum, surplus synapses between climbing fibers (CF) and Purkinje cells (PC) are developmentally pruned. Here, Nakayama and colleagues show that ablation of microglia impairs pruning of CF-PC synapses because of dysfunction of GABAergic inhibition prerequisite for pruning.","Synapse,Purkinje cell,Neurotransmission,Neuroscience,Neurogenesis,Molecular biology,Microglia,Inhibitory postsynaptic potential,Climbing fiber,Cerebellum,Biology,Population,Neuroscience,Neuroglia,Neurotransmitter receptor,Neuroscience,Neuroinflammation,Synaptic pruning,Synaptic maturation,Neuroscience,Synaptic pruning,Synapse,Signal transduction,Synaptic plasticity,Synapse,Signal transduction,Signal transduction,Programmed cell death,Progenitor cell,Visual cortex,Synaptic pruning,Synapse,Receptor,Progenitor cell,Phagocytosis,Precursor cell,Neuroscience,Neuron,Transgene,Transforming growth factor,Synaptic pruning","Hisako Nakayama,Manabu Abe,Chie Morimoto,Tadatsune Iida,Shigeo Okabe,Kenji Sakimura,Kouichi Hashimoto,Florent Ginhoux,Melanie Greter,Marylene Leboeuf,Sayan Nandi,Peter See,Helmut Kettenmann,Uwe-Karsten Hanisch,Mami Noda,Alexei Verkhratsky,Rosa C.

1025,Impact of a participatory agroecological development project on household wealth and food security in Malawi,2017-01-01,Food Security,10.1007/S12571-017-0669-Z,"Abstract This paper presents the impacts of a participatory agroecological development project on food security and wealth levels. The Malawi Farmer to Farmer Agroecology project (MAFFA) encourages farmer experimentation, community involvement and farmer-to-farmer teaching on agroecology, nutrition and gender equity. Recent international assessments of agriculture have highlighted the urgent need for changes in farming practices in Sub-Saharan Africa, due to land degradation, high levels of food insecurity and anticipated climate change impacts. Agroecological approaches have shown great potential to address these multiple needs. Using a longitudinal panel survey data and propensity score matching to account for selection bias in project participation, we analyzed the impact of the project on household income and food security in Malawi in 2012 (Wave 1 = 1200 households) and in 2014 (Wave 2 = 1000 households). We used the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) for impact evaluation. Estimates of average treatment-effects using difference in difference methods showed that participating in MAFFA has led to a significant increase in household wealth (β = 3.54, p = 0.01) and a large reduction in food insecurity (β = −3.21, p = 0.01) compared to non-participants, after 2 years, even after accounting for covariates and selection bias. These results indicate that agroecological methods combined with farmer led knowledge exchanges can be welfare enhancing, both in terms of food security and in terms of income for family farm households. Agroecological approaches should be promoted through upscaling of farmer-to-farmer knowledge exchanges, community involvement and attention to nutrition and social equity to enhance farmer learning and household welfare benefits.","Selection bias,Impact evaluation,Household income,Food security,Family farm,Environmental resource management,Economics,Difference in differences,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Statistics,Research design,Regression analysis,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Socioeconomic status,Population,Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys,Variables,Statistics,Propensity score matching,Statistics,Selection bias,Propensity score method,Treatment effect,Statistics,Selection bias,Soil science,Population,Organic farming,Syntax,Statistics,Propensity score matching,Sustainable agriculture,Soil conservation,Integrated pest management,Selection method,Longitudinal data,Foreign acquisition","Joseph Kangmennaang,Rachel Bezner Kerr,Esther Lupafya,Laifolo Dakishoni,Peter C.

We advocate a new integrated research paradigm that explicitly recognizes cost-benefit trade-offs among animal activities and acknowledges that these activities occur within social-ecological contexts. Support for this paradigm is presented in an evidence-based conceptual model structured around five evidence statements highlighting emerging trends applicable to sustainable agriculture. The full range of benefits and costs associated with animal activities in agroecosystems cannot be quantified by focusing on single species groups, crops, or systems. Management of productive agroecosystems should sustain cycles of ecological interactions between crops and wild animals, not isolate these cycles from the system. Advancing this paradigm will therefore require integrated studies that determine net returns of animal activity in agroecosystems.","Sustainable agriculture,Predation,Pollination,Ecosystem services,Ecosystem,Ecology,Conceptual model,Biology,Agroecology,Agriculture,Worker bee,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Land grabbing,Food security,Ecosystem services,Thiamethoxam,Pollinator,Pesticide,Terrestrial ecosystem,Sustainable yield,Soil biodiversity,Seasonal breeder,Pollinator,Pesticide,Population,Pest control,PEST analysis,Species richness,Pollinator,Pollination,Species richness,Species diversity,Plant community,Worker bee,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Food security,Food chain,Environmental engineering","Manu E.

Considering food consumption patterns as an expression of socio-economic interaction, we analyse human remains for carbon and nitrogen isotopes in order to establish dietary intake, then model isotopic niches to characterize dietary diversity and infer connectivity among communities of urbanites and nomadic pastoralists. The combination of low isotopic variation visible within urban groups with isotopic distinction between urban communities irrespective of local environmental conditions strongly suggests localized food production systems provided primary subsistence rather than agricultural goods exchanged along trade routes. Nomadic communities, in contrast, experienced higher dietary diversity reflecting engagements with a wide assortment of foodstuffs typical for mobile communities. These data indicate tightly bound social connectivity in urban centres pointedly funnelled local food products and homogenized dietary intake within settled communities, whereas open and opportunistic systems of food production and circulation were possible through more mobile lifeways.","Subsistence agriculture,Pastoralism,Isotope analysis,Geography,Food processing,Food history,Ecology,Ecological niche,Agroecology,Agriculture,Wind speed,Weather station,Satellite,Unified Soil Classification System,Soil texture,Soil science,Stable isotope ratio,Sample size determination,Multivariate statistics,δ13C,Transpiration,Photosynthesis,Trophic level,Strengths and weaknesses,Stable isotope ratio,Stable isotope ratio,Niche,Ecology,Trophic niche,Species evenness,Predation,δ15N,δ13C,Stable isotope ratio,Prologue,History,HERO,Structuralism,Sociology,Social constructionism","Taylor R.

1028,Detailed mtDNA genotypes permit a reassessment of the settlement and population structure of the Andaman Islands.,2008-01-01,American Journal of Physical Anthropology,10.1002/AJPA.20773,"The population genetics of the Indian subcontinent is central to understanding early human prehistory due to its strategic location on the proposed corridor of human movement from Africa to Australia dur- ing the late Pleistocene. Previous genetic research using mtDNA has emphasized the relative isolation of the late Pleistocene colonizers, and the physically isolated Anda- man Island populations of Island South-East Asia remain the source of claims supporting an early split between the populations that formed the patchy settlement pattern along the coast of the Indian Ocean. Using whole-genome sequencing, combined with multiplexed SNP typing, this study investigates the deep structure of mtDNA hap- logroups M31 and M32 in India and the Andaman Islands. The identification of a so far unnoticed rare polymorphism shared between these two lineages suggests that they are actually sister groups within a single haplogroup, M31 0 32. The enhanced resolution of M31 allows for the inference of a more recent colonization of the Andaman Islands than previously suggested, but cannot reject the very early peo- pling scenario. We further demonstrate a widespread overlap of mtDNA and cultural markers between the two major language groups of the Andaman archipelago. Given the ''completeness'' of the genealogy based on whole genome sequences, and the multiple scenarios for the peo- pling of the Andaman Islands sustained by this inferred genealogy, our study hints that further mtDNA based phylogeographic studies are unlikely to unequivocally support any one of these possibilities.

Megadiverse countries and centers of origin and/or diversity of crop species are particularly vulnerable regions. The future of sustainable agriculture may be irreversibly jeopardized by contamination of in situ preserved genetic resources threatening a strategic resource for the world’s food security. Because GM crops are truly biological novelties, their release into the environment poses concerns about the unpredictable ecological and evolutionary responses that GM species themselves and the interacting biota may express in the medium and long term. One of the consequences of these processes may be a generalized contamination of natural flora by GM traits and a degradation and erosion of the commonly owned genetic resources available today for agricultural development.

We monitored eleven IAA-farms from September 2002 to September 2004. ECOPATH models, based on nitrogen flows, produced 19 agro-ecological system attributes that were reduced to four factors by factor analysis (Productivity-Efficiency; Diversity; Maturity; Aquaculture Integration), explaining 76.8% of total variance. In general, R-HF farms scored higher on Productivity-Efficiency, R-MF on Diversity, and O-LF farms on Maturity than the other systems. Within all three farm systems, variability among farms was high, caused by differences in land use, financial and crop disease constraints, market possibilities, and family conditions. The ponds and ditches served as a trap to capture nutrients and re-distribute them to other parts of the farms. Despite the differences in intensity of fish keeping between the three systems, the fish ponds in the rice-based systems and fish in ditches in the orchard-based system contributed to the same extent to the nutrient supply of other components. Differences in nutrient efficiency among the farming systems were caused primarily by the inefficient orchard and rice components on the O-LF farms. Fertilizers were often applied in excess. Nutrient use efficiency should be improved through proper application of fertilizers and promotion of the traditional integration practices.","Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Nutrient,Land use,Integrated production,Ecology,Biology,Aquaculture,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Structural diversity,Species diversity,Species discovery curve,Statistics,Statistical theory,Statistical software,Sustainable development,Resource management,Natural resource management,SAGE,Library science,Data science,Steady state,Software,Microcomputer,Trophic level,Lake ecosystem,Freshwater ecosystem,Sustainability,Rural history,Green Revolution,Vagueness,Total human ecosystem,Environmental ethics,Nutrient cycle,Mixed farming,Livelihood,Sustainability,Ranking,Energy flow","L.T.

1032,Advancing Intercropping Research and Practices in Industrialized Agricultural Landscapes,2018-01-01,Agriculture,10.3390/AGRICULTURE8060080,"Sustainable intensification calls for agroecological and adaptive management of the agrifood system. Here, we focus on intercropping and how this agroecological practice can be used to increase the sustainability of crop production. Strip, mixed, and relay intercropping can be used to increase crop yields through resource partitioning and facilitation. In addition to achieving greater productivity, diversifying cropping systems through the use of strategic intercrops can increase yield stability, reduce pests, and improve soil health. Several intercropping systems are already implemented in industrialized agricultural landscapes, including mixed intercropping with perennial grasses and legumes as forage and relay intercropping with winter wheat and red clover. Because intercropping can provide numerous benefits, researchers should be clear about their objectives and use appropriate methods so as to not draw spurious conclusions when studying intercrops. In order to advance the practice, experiments that test the effects of intercropping should use standardized methodology, and researchers should report a set of common criteria to facilitate cross-study comparisons. Intercropping with two or more crops appears to be less common with annuals than perennials, which is likely due to differences in the mechanisms responsible for complementarity. One area where intercropping with annuals in industrialized agricultural landscapes has advanced is with cover crops, where private, public, and governmental organizations have harmonized efforts to increase the adoption of cover crop mixtures.","Sustainability,Intercropping,Cropping,Crop yield,Crop diversity,Cover crop,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Adaptive management,Regression analysis,Open data,Medicine,Plant diversity,Niche complementarity,Niche,Trophic level,Species richness,Global biodiversity,Species richness,Polyculture,Monoculture,Species diversity,Spatial heterogeneity,Population,Precautionary principle,Natural resource,Habitat,Species diversity,Global biodiversity,Functional ecology,Sustainability,Landscape ecology,Food security,Plant community,Phylogenetic diversity,Niche,Subsistence agriculture,Soil biodiversity,Niche complementarity","K.

This allows prioritizing the practices that ensure both the food security of farmers and the low carbon impact associated to climate change. To tackle food security challenges and to maintain sustainable environment production, agroecological practices were planned for farmers in the Itasy region, Central Highlands of Madagascar. The project consisted of agroforestry and forestry systems, composting of organic matters, and system of rice intensification. The goals of this study were (i) to assess the CFP of farms in the Itasy region Central Madagascar, (ii) to assess the impact of agroecological practices adopted by farmers on farms CFP, and (iii) to compare the impact of Tier 1 and Tier 3 factors for carbon removal in woody biomass and in cropland soils on farms CFP. For these purposes, a survey of 192 representative farms was realized during the years 2012–2013. Agroecological practices integrated at farm scale reduced significantly farms CFP up to 364% in terms of land surface and up to 578% in terms of food production, suggesting an important GHG sequestration at farm scale. Main sources of GHG at farms scale were: nitrous oxide from soil management (25%), methane from rice cultivation (24%), livestock manure management (24%), and enteric fermentation (23%). Trees planted in agroforestry and forestry systems offered the highest GHG mitigation benefits. Tier 1 factors overestimated up to 7 times higher the farms CFP compared to Tier 3 factors. This study highlights that the integration of agro-ecological practices at farm scale offers significant GHG mitigation and carbon sequestration in Malagasy context, thus giving an alternative for climate change mitigation.","System of Rice Intensification,Soil management,Greenhouse gas,Food security,Economics,Climate change mitigation,Carbon sequestration,Carbon footprint,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Working group,Vulnerability,Sustainability and systemic change resistance,Growing season,Geography,Food prices,Environmental science,Environmental engineering,Carbon footprint,Manure management,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Tropics,Tropical climate,Tree allometry,Tillage,Soil water,Soil science,Sustainability,Soil quality,Poverty,Tillage,Seedbed,Nutrient,Warning system,Tropical climate,Poverty,Underpinning,Timeline,Sustainability","Narindra H.

In particular, agroforestry systems have the potential to conserve native tree diversity and sequester carbon for climate change mitigation. However, little research has been conducted on the temporal stability of species diversity and aboveground carbon stocks in these systems or the relation between species diversity and aboveground carbon sequestration. We measured changes in shade-tree diversity and shade-tree carbon stocks in 14 plots of a 35-ha coffee cooperative over 9 years and analyzed relations between species diversity and carbon sequestration. Carbon sequestration was positively correlated with initial species richness of shade trees. Species diversity of shade trees did not change significantly over the study period, but carbon stocks increased due to tree growth. Our results show a potential for carbon sequestration and long-term biodiversity conservation in smallholder coffee agroforestry systems and illustrate the opportunity for synergies between biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.

Use of any of these species requires special cultural knowledge regarding harvesting, preparation, cooking and other forms of processing. Many were, and are, prepared and served in mixtures or combinations. In most cases, too, the species are managed, tended or manipulated in some way to increase their productivity and availability. Many of the most widely used species are categorized as weeds—species that grow and reproduce readily in disturbed or cleared land, and are common around human settlements and agricultural areas.

To date, insight into these approaches has often been based on reports from isolated anecdotal case studies. Although these are informative, and provide evidence that people are using ecosystems to adapt, they provide rather limited insight in terms of measuring and evaluating the effectiveness of EbA, especially when compared with technical or structural adaptation interventions. The body of scientific evidence indicating how effective such approaches are is lacking in some aspects. Where evidence does exist it is often dispersed across a range of related fields, such as natural resource management, disaster risk reduction and agroecology. To date, there has been little attempt to systematically assemble and analyse this evidence.

However, even though the components of the agrifood systems are all strongly interconnected, the design processes to improve their sustainabilities are still mostly managed separately. This frequently leads to innovating in one domain in order to adapt to the constraints or specifications of the other, such as tweaking the farming systems to address processing issues, or the other way round. The objectives of this paper are first to show the limits of such an organization, and second to provide a heuristic framework to organize the design of coupled innovations, by reconnecting the dynamics of innovation in agriculture and food, with a view to improving the whole agrifood system.","Underline,Tweaking,Sustainability,Operations management,Open innovation,Industrial organization,Heuristic,Food systems,Economics,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Technological transitions,Technological innovation system,Technological change,Public policy,Presumption,Panacea (medicine),Omnivore,Natural history,Ethnology,Organizational economics,Management science,Economics,Path dependency,Path dependence,Path creation,Technological transitions,Sustainable development,Sociotechnical system,User requirements document,Technological transitions,Technological innovation system,Vegan Diet,Type 2 diabetes,Saturated fat,Sustainable development,Innovation management,Innovation economics","Jean Marc Meynard,Marie-Hélène Jeuffroy,Marianne Le Bail,Amélie Lefevre,Marie-Benoît Magrini,Camille Michon,David Tilman,Kenneth G.

1185,A new hypothesis for the functional role of diversity in mediating resource pools and weed–crop competition in agroecosystems,2010-01-01,Weed Research,10.1111/J.1365-3180.2009.00745.X,"Smith RG, Mortensen DA & Ryan MR (2009). A new hypothesis for the functional role of diversity in mediating resource pools and weed–crop competition in agroecosystems. Weed Research.50, 37–48. Summary We develop a new conceptual model we call the Resource Pool Diversity Hypothesis (RPDH) aimed at explaining how soil resource pool diversity may mediate competition for soil resources between weeds and crops. The primary tenets of the RPDH are that (i) in plant communities, the intensity of inter-specific competition can depend upon the degree to which niche differentiation and resource partitioning occur among species, (ii) agricultural systems are unique in that management practices, such as crop rotation, source of fertility and weed management, result in inputs to the soil and (iii) these inputs directly or indirectly become soil resource pools from which crops and weeds may partition resources. The RPDH leads to the novel prediction that along a gradient of increasing cropping system diversity, yield loss due to weed–crop competition (i.e. the impact on yield per unit weed density) for soil resources should decrease. Similarly, the degree to which crops and weeds overlap in soil resource niche breadth (which is determined by species-specific functional traits for resource acquisition), will determine the extent to which weed–crop competition weakens as resource pool diversity increases. While there have been no direct tests of the RPDH, we highlight evidence from the agricultural literature that provides strong support for components of the hypothesis. Validation of the RPDH would have important implications across a broad range of cropping systems for the development of management strategies that aim to reduce yield loss impact per unit weed plant density and the fundamental principles of integrated weed management, such as the concepts of weed thresholds and critical periods.","Weed control,Weed,Resource Acquisition Is Initialization,Interspecific competition,Ecology,Cropping system,Crop rotation,Crop diversity,Botany,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Terrestrial ecosystem,Species richness,Species diversity,Soil microbiology,Soil biology,Relative species abundance,Vacant niche,Organism,Niche segregation,Tree canopy,Symbiosis,Seedling,Soil nutrients,Plant species,Plant community,Weed control,Glyphosate,Crop growth,Spite,Positive feedback,Population ecology,Tundra,Species diversity,Plant community,Spatial ecology,Soil water,Soil biology,Soil water,Soil quality,Soil organic matter","R G Smith,D A Mortensen,M R Ryan,Marcel G.

This study explored how a set of grain farmers and rotational graziers in Iowa transitioned to agroecological management practices. Our focus on the resources and strategies that farmers mobilized to develop opportunities for, and overcome barriers to, transitioning to alternative practices allows us to go beyond the existing literature focused on why farmers transition. We attend to both the ecological and socioeconomic context of innovation by comparing processes of technical change in two contrasting regions of Iowa. Farmers cultivated farm-level biodiversity and enterprise diversity, developed new cognitive and psychological competencies, and overcame barriers to innovation by developing external network linkages with peers, knowledge organizations, and federal policies. Our research provides insights into how biophysical, cognitive, structural and market considerations can be integrated into research efforts that aim to make sense of innovation toward sustainable agriculture.","Technical change,Sustainable agriculture,Socioeconomic status,Resource-based view,Intensive farming,Environmental resource management,Economics,Competence (human resources),Agroecology,Agriculture,Virtual community of practice,Situated learning,Psychology,Runaway climate change,Natural resource economics,Environmental engineering,Sociology,Social science,Qualitative research,Unit of analysis,Technology and society,Technological transitions,Public policy,Popularity,Panacea (medicine),Qualitative research,Psychology,Management science,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Sociology,Wright,Sociology,Socialism,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource,Globalization,Geopolitics,Genealogy","Jennifer Blesh,Steven A.

Cultivar mixtures are a straightforward way to increase within-crop diversity, but they have so far been poorly used by farmers and they are not encouraged by advisory services. Based on the methodology developed by Kiaer et al. (2009), we achieved a meta-analysis of cultivar mixtures in wheat. Among the 120 publications dedicated to wheat, we selected 32 studies to analyze various factors that may condition the success or failure of wheat mixtures by calculating overyielding, i.e. the difference in productivity of a variety mixture compared with the weighted mean of its component varieties in pure stand. The analysis highlighted a significant global overyielding of 3.5%, which reached 6.2% in condition of high disease pressures. Overyielding was not affected by seeding density or plot size. Under high disease pressure, overyielding increased by 3.2% point per added component variety. Overyielding was respectively 5.3% and 3.3% higher for mixtures heterogeneous in disease resistance or phenology than for homogeneous ones, and did not vary when considering height. Overyielding reached its highest values in the 1980s and 1990s, which reflects the predominance of disease-focused studies during this period. Our results confirm that cultivar mixtures are a potential way to increase yield relatively to pure varieties, especially under low pesticide cropping systems. Literature suggests that mixture practice is impeded by the lack of general rules that could help to mixing varieties. To design such rules it is needed to (1) achieve new experiments manipulating the heterogeneity in variety traits, (2) determine experimentally the ecological mechanisms underlying mixture performance and (3) develop new models allowing testing and analyzing these mechanisms.","Plant disease resistance,Phenology,Meta-analysis,Homogeneous,Cultivar,Cropping,Botany,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroecology,Software engineering,Software analytics,Reference software,Systematic review,Study heterogeneity,Statistics,Variance estimation,Statistics,Regression,Population,Nitrogen cycle,Global change,Trim and fill,Statistics,Publication bias,Surface runoff,Nonpoint source pollution,Manure,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Total human ecosystem,Species diversity,Geography,Soil carbon,Radiative forcing,Methane,Paddy field,Oryza sativa,Monoculture","J.

1281,Chapter Two - Agronomic Biofortification of Cereal Grains with Iron and Zinc,2013-01-01,Advances in Agronomy,10.1016/B978-0-12-800137-0.00002-9,"Abstract Iron and zinc deficiencies in human nutrition are widespread in developing Asian and African countries where cereal grains are the staple food. Effects are therefore underway to develop cereal genotypes with grains denser in Fe and Zn by traditional plant breeding or using genetic engineering techniques. This approach requires a long period and adequate funds. However, the products of genetic engineering are not well accepted in many countries. Also, there is a trade-off between yield and grain biofortification. Agronomic biofortification offers to achieve this without sacrificing on yield and with no problem of product acceptance. From the viewpoint of biofortification, foliar application has been reported to be better than the soil application of Fe and Zn, and for this purpose, chelated Fe and Zn fertilizers are better. When soil applied, water soluble sources of Zn are better. Soil application of Fe is not recommended. Agronomic biofortification depends upon management practices (tillage, water management, nutrient interactions), soil factors (amounts present, pH, mechanisms of Zn fixation other than pH), and plant factors (root characteristics, excretion of phytosiderophores and organic acids by roots, Zn utilization at the cellular level, translocation within plant and mechanisms of Zn accumulation in grain). Genetic and agronomic biofortification are complementary to each other. Once the genotypes having denser grains are developed, they will have to be adequately fertilized with Fe and Zn. However, much more research in agronomy, soil science, and plant physiology is needed to understand the complex soil–plant–management interaction under different agroecological conditions under which cereals are grown. The situation is more complex for rice, which is grown under flooded, upland, and intermediate water conditions.","Zinc,Tillage,Plant breeding,Nutrient,Micronutrient,Human nutrition,Biology,Biofortification,Agronomy,Agroecology,Wasting,Surgery,Population,Xylem,Rhizosphere,Plant nutrition,Vitamin D and neurology,Vitamin,Nutrient,Soil water,Plant breeding,Cultivar,beta-Carotene,Provitamin,Oryza sativa,Transferrin saturation,Transferrin receptor,Transferrin,Zinc,Soil water,Crop,Zinc toxicity,Zinc,Thlaspi caerulescens,Polymer chemistry,Hydrolysis,Chemistry,Staple food,Micronutrient,Malnutrition","Rajendra Prasad,Yashbir S.

Questions about plant domestication and the origins of agriculture have engaged scholars for well over a century, with implications for understanding its legacy on global subsistence strategies, plant distribution, population health and the global methane budget. Rice is one of the most important crops to be domesticated globally, with both Asia (Oryza sativa L.) and Africa (Oryza glaberrima Steud.) discussed as primary centres of domestication. However, until now the pre-Columbian domestication of rice in the Americas has not been documented. Here we document the domestication of Oryza sp. wild rice by the mid-Holocene residents of the Monte Castelo shell mound starting at approximately 4,000 cal. yr bp, evidenced by increasingly larger rice husk phytoliths. Our data provide evidence for the domestication of wild rice in a region of the Amazon that was also probably the cradle of domestication of other major crops such as cassava (Manihot esculenta), peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and chilli pepper (Capsicum sp.).

1294,Novel and designed ecosystems,2016-01-01,Restoration Ecology,10.1111/REC.12410,"Growing attention to novel and designed ecosystems, and the confusion that follows from the overlap of these distinct ecosystem approaches, risks a loss of focus on ecological values at the core of restoration ecology. Novel ecosystems originate in ecosystems that are transformed beyond which the practical efforts of conventional restoration are feasible. They are also self-sustaining in the sense that they take time to form, and do not typically receive regular management. In this respect, they arise differently than designed ecosystems, which are assembled with specific goals in mind and are often heavily managed. Designed (or engineered) ecosystems comprise a variety of ecological approaches including reclamation (return a degraded ecosystem to productive capacity), green infrastructure, and agroecological systems. There are three elements that distinguish novel and designed ecosystems. Designed ecosystems typically require intensive intervention to create them, and ongoing management to sustain them; novel ecosystems do not. Second, the human intentions behind designed and novel ecosystems are usually different. Designed ecosystems exist in the service of human interests, including specific services (e.g. filtration, cooling, nature appreciation), aesthetics, and shifting value commitments toward green infrastructure; novel ecosystems arise typically through inadvertent human activity. Third, designed and novel ecosystems have different developmental pathways. Historical ecosystems are the starting point for restored, hybrid, and novel ecosystems; designed ecosystems are intentionally created. Designed ecosystems stand apart as providing a new origin for ecosystems of the future, including those that become novel ecosystems.","Restoration ecology,Productive capacity,Novel ecosystem,Green infrastructure,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem diversity,Ecosystem,Ecology,Confusion,Biology,Agroecology,Underpinning,Planetary boundaries,Planet,Urban infrastructure,Social processes,Human health,Summit,Restoration ecology,Political science,Threshold models,Ecology,Critical threshold,Novel ecosystem,Integrated approach,Environmental resource management,World order,Novel ecosystem,Environmental science,Scrutiny,Restoration ecology,Novel ecosystem,Water flow,Natural capital,Environmental resource management,Restoration ecology,Functional ecology,Fidelity,Precipitation,Pelagic zone,Pacific decadal oscillation","Eric Higgs,Will Steffen,Katherine Richardson,Johan Rockström,Sarah E.

It is unlikely that transgenes can be retracted once they have escaped, thus the damage to the purity of non-GM seeds is permanent. The dominant GM crops have the potential to reduce biodiversity further by increasing agricultural intensification. There are also potential risks to biodiversity arising from gene flow and toxicity to nontarget organisms from herbicide-resistant (HT) and insect-resistant (Bt) crops. Unless whole regions are declared GM agriculture free, the development of distinct systems of agriculture (GM and non-GM) will be impossible as GM agriculture emerges at the expense of all other forms of production.","Sociology,Organic farming,Genetically modified organism,Genetically modified crops,Genetic contamination,Crop,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Pollen,Monarch butterfly,Larva,Sustainability,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Poverty,Pest control,Hectare,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Soil quality,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization,Sustainable agriculture,Pest control,Integrated pest management,Traditional knowledge,Organic farming,Natural resource economics,Transgene,Sunflower,Helianthus annuus,Transgene,Squash,Rate of development","Miguel A.

The industry must find solutions to issues regarding animal welfare, health and sustainability and will have to do so in the face of competition from emerging non-traditional meat and protein products in an increasingly complex regulatory environment. These novel meat and protein products, otherwise known as ‘artificial meat’ are utilising ground breaking technologies designed to meet the issues facing the conventional meat industry. These artificial meats, in vitro or cultured meat and meat from genetically modified organisms have no real capacity to compete with conventional meat production in the present environment. However, meat replacements manufactured from plant proteins and mycoproteins are currently the biggest competitors and are gaining a small percentage of the market. Manufactured meats may push conventional meat into the premium end of the market, and supply the bulk, cheap end of the market if conventional meat products become more expensive and the palatability and versatility of manufactured meats improve. In time the technology for other artificial meats such as meat from genetic modified organisms or cultured meat may become sufficiently developed for these products to enter the market with no complexity of the competition between meat products. Conventional meat producers can assimilate agroecology ecology concepts in order to develop sustainable animal production systems. The conventional meat industry can also benefit from assimilating biotechnologies such as cloning and genetic modification technologies, using the technology to adapt to the changing environment and respond to the increasing competition from artificial meats. Although it will depend at least partly on the evolution of conventional meat production, the future of artificial meat produced from stem cells appears uncertain at this time.","Sustainable production,Sustainability,Resource use,Meat packing industry,Cultured meat,Consumer satisfaction,Biotechnology,Biology,Animal production,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agricultural science,Point of sale,Perception,New product development,Qualitative property,Processed meat,Pillar,Environmental science,Environmental protection,Clearing,Water use,Research method,Nutrient,Stem cell,Optimal combination,Meat packing industry,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Livestock,Rapeseed,Pesticide residue,Novel protein,Soil indicators,Research groups,Product testing,Social psychology,Related factors,Psychology,Radiative forcing,Livestock,Life-cycle assessment","Sarah P F Bonny,Graham E Gardner,David W Pethick,Jean-François Hocquette,Klaus G.

1350,Ecosystem Services from Edible Insects in Agricultural Systems: A Review.,2017-01-01,Insects,10.3390/INSECTS8010024,"Many of the most nutritionally and economically important edible insects are those that are harvested from existing agricultural systems. Current strategies of agricultural intensification focus predominantly on increasing crop yields, with no or little consideration of the repercussions this may have for the additional harvest and ecology of accompanying food insects. Yet such insects provide many valuable ecosystem services, and their sustainable management could be crucial to ensuring future food security. This review considers the multiple ecosystem services provided by edible insects in existing agricultural systems worldwide. Directly and indirectly, edible insects contribute to all four categories of ecosystem services as outlined by the Millennium Ecosystem Services definition: provisioning, regulating, maintaining, and cultural services. They are also responsible for ecosystem disservices, most notably significant crop damage. We argue that it is crucial for decision-makers to evaluate the costs and benefits of the presence of food insects in agricultural systems. We recommend that a key priority for further research is the quantification of the economic and environmental contribution of services and disservices from edible insects in agricultural systems.","Sustainable management,Provisioning,Food security,Entomophagy,Ecosystem services,Ecosystem,Ecology,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Total economic value,Payment for ecosystem services,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Pollination management,Relative species abundance,Population,Extinction,Swarm robotics,Swarm behaviour,Scalability,World population,Total fertility rate,Projections of population growth,Land use,Land management,Habitat","Charlotte L.

1351,Agroecological Formación in Rural Social Movements,2014-01-01,Radical Teacher,10.5195/RT.2014.71,"Among the many sectors currently engaged in struggle against the corporate food system, small farmers play a particularly important role—not only do they constitute a legitimate alternative to global agribusiness, but also they are the heirs to long traditions of local knowledge and practice. In defending peasant agriculture, rural social movements defend popular control over seeds and genetic resources, water, land and territory against the onslaught of globalized financial capital. A framework called food sovereignty has been developed by the international peasant movement La Via Campesina (LVC), to encompass the various elements of a food system alternative based on reclaiming popular resource control, defending small-scale agriculture and traditional knowledge, rebuilding local circuits of food and labor, and recovering the ecological processes that can make farming sustainable. Recognizing the need to develop “movement people” capable of integrating many ecological, social, cultural and political criteria into their organizational activities, LVC increasingly has articulated processes of popular education and consciousness-raising as part of the global social movement for agroecology and food sovereignty. Given the enormous diversity of organizations and actors in LVC, an underlying feature known in Spanish as dialogo de saberes (roughly the equivalent of “dialogue between ways of knowing”) has characterized LVC processes of education, training, formation and exchange in agroecology. The dialogo de saberes takes place at the level of training centers and schools of the LVC organizations, as well as the larger scale of agricultural landscapes and peasant territories. The interactions between peasant, family or communal farmers, their organizations, their youth and their agroecology create social processes that assume the form and dynamic of a social movement in several countries of Latin America.","Traditional knowledge,Sociology,Social movement,Popular education,Pedagogy,Peasant,Food systems,Food sovereignty,Financial capital,Economy,Agroecology,Sustainable transport,Subsidy,Per capita,Social movement,Political science,Political economy,Social movement,Political economy,Phenomenon,Sovereignty,Right to food,Politics,Sustainability,Environmental ethics,Ecology,Sociology,Social science,Social movement,Economy,Economics,Economic growth,Sociology,Sociological theory,Social science,Socialism,Social movement,Public administration,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Peasant","Nils McCune,Juan Reardon,Peter Rosset,Jules Pretty,Andrew Stephen Ball,T Lang,J I L Morison,Annette Aurélie Desmarais,Peter M.

Climate models project increasingly negative effects on maize and sorghum production in sub-Saharan Africa. We present a case study of the role of genetic resources and seed systems in adapting to climatic stress from the semi-arid agroecological zone in Tanzania. Crop adaptation, switching to more drought-tolerant crop species or varieties, is an important adaptation strategy within a diverse portfolio of livelihood responses to climatic stress. Crop adaptation involves the adoption of improved maize varieties combined with continued use of local varieties of both maize and sorghum. Regression modelling shows that households receiving the extension service and owning livestock are more likely to switch to drought-tolerant varieties as a response to climatic stress than those without access to these assets. The seed system in the study area consists of both formal and informal elements. The informal channels supply the highest quantities of both sorghum and maize seeds. Recycling of improved varieties of maize is common and the majority of households practice seed selection. Detailed assessment of the three different categories of genetic resources – local, improved and farmer-recycled varieties – reveals that drought tolerance is more frequently reported as a reason for growing local varieties than for growing improved varieties of maize and sorghum. The significantly later maturity reported for local varieties compared to the improved varieties bred to have a short growing cycle indicates that households distinguish between drought-tolerance and drought-avoidance traits. Seed system perspectives on crop adaptation offer insights into the complex ways crop adaptation is realized at the livelihood level. The integration of informal and formal seed system elements is important for the adaptive capacity of agriculture-based livelihoods. Our findings highlight the value and importance of location-specific information about crop variety use for arriving at realistic recommendations in impact and adaptation studies.","Sorghum,Livelihood,Drought tolerance,Crop,Botany,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural biodiversity,Adaptive capacity,Vulnerability,Sustainability,Latin Americans,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Public administration,Political science,Group ii,Vulnerability assessment,Vulnerability,Top-down and bottom-up design,South asia,Natural resource economics,Malnutrition,Subsistence agriculture,Rural management,Rural economics,Special Report on Emissions Scenarios,Socioeconomics,Population,Global warming,Food systems,Food security,Environmental resource management,Environmental planning,Economics,Sustainable development,Public policy,Political economy of climate change","Ola Tveitereid Westengen,Anne Krag Brysting,Martin Parry,Osvaldo Canziani,Jean Palutikof,Paul van der Linden,Clair Hanson,H.

1367,Worldwide Evaluations of Quinoa: Preliminary Results from Post International Year of Quinoa FAO Projects in Nine Countries,2016-01-01,Frontiers in Plant Science,10.3389/FPLS.2016.00850,"Chenopodium quinoa Willd., a high quality grain crop, is resistant to abiotic stresses (drought, cold and salt) and offers an optimal source of protein. Quinoa represents a symbol of crop genetic diversity across the Andean region. In recent years, this crop has undergone a major expansion outside its countries of origin. The activities carried out within the framework of the International Year of Quinoa provided a great contribution to raise awareness on the multiple benefits of quinoa as well as to its wider cultivation at the global level. FAO is actively involved in promoting and evaluating the cultivation of quinoa in 26 countries outside the Andean region with the aim to strengthen food and nutrition security. The main goal of this research is to evaluate the adaptability of selected quinoa genotypes under different environments outside the Andean region. This paper presents the preliminary results from nine countries. Field evaluations were conducted during 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 in Asia (Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan), and the Near East and North African countries (Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Mauritania, and Yemen). In each country, the trials were carried out in different locations that globally represent the diversity of 19 agrarian systems under different agro-ecological conditions. Twenty-one genotypes of quinoa were tested using the same experimental protocol in all locations consisting in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates. Some genotypes showed higher yields and the Q18 and Q12 landraces displayed greater adaptation than others to new environmental conditions. The Q21 and Q26 landraces were evaluated with stable and satisfactory levels of yield (>1t.ha-1) in each of the different trial sites. This production stability is of considerable importance especially under climate change uncertainty. While these results suggest that this Andean crop is able to grow in many different environments, social and cultural considerations remain crucial regarding its possible introduction as a staple food in new cropping systems around the world.","Staple food,Middle East,Cropping,Crop,Chenopodium quinoa,Botany,Biology,Agroecology,Agricultural biodiversity,Adaptability,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Water-use efficiency,Population,Plant breeding,Pseudocereal,Plant foods,Human nutrition,Water supply,Water scarcity,Twenty-First Century,Salinity,Pseudocereal,Protein quality,Population,Food security,Ecosystem services,Plant breeding,Limiting,Gene–environment interaction,Soil salinity,Snow,Precipitation,World population,Population growth,Political science,Subtropics,Gluten,Food security","Didier Bazile,Cataldo Pulvento,Alexis Verniau,Mohammad S.

Yet these politics are contested: between the interests of new ‘middle farmers’ who are ‘accumulating from below’ and politically connected elites and large-scale capital who see different opportunities for land-based accumulation. These dynamics are being played out in different ways in different parts of the country, depending on the agroecological potential of the area, the way the land reform unfolded and local political actors and processes.

1369,Resilience in a concentrated and consolidated food system,2015-01-01,Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,10.1007/S13412-015-0292-2,"The focus of this article is to articulate the risks of a consolidated, industrialized agrifood system for our planet’s ecology and our ability to guarantee a future food supply, while also considering how the food system might become more resilient. A relatively small number of agribusiness firms, operating globally, have powerfully shaped who produces food, what is produced, how and where it is produced, and by whom it is eaten. To examine food system resilience, one must see that ecological risks of agriculture (e.g., monoculture, overuse of fertilizer and chemicals, and lack of genetic diversity) are intertwined with its social and economic organization, that relationships between people and between people and their particular places are critical to situate food decisions within ecology, and that issues of scale in a global food system are keenly important and challenging to resolve. Our highly concentrated global food system has resulted from horizontal and vertical integration in food system sectors and globalization of agricultural and food markets. This system constrains farmers (and others) in making choices that can fend off likely ecological and social disruptions while limiting their ability to accommodate change. It has eliminated smaller farms and businesses that provided a redundancy of role and function, resulting in few fail-safe mechanisms for the food system. A focus on efficiency, standardization, and specialization has decreased the diversity of scale, form, and organization across the food system. Finally, the dominant food system’s inability to solve food insecurity and hunger within both rich and poor countries, coupled with an industrial diet that uses up a great many natural resources, makes the system precarious. While there is no single approach at any given scale that will accomplish food system resilience, a combination of actions, strategies, and policies at multiple levels that are rooted in ecology, democracy, and economic and social equality is necessary to move forward.","Sustainable development,Social equality,Psychological resilience,Natural resource economics,Natural resource,Food systems,Food security,Environmental resource management,Economics,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sociology,Socio-ecological system,Social science,Transformational leadership,Socio-ecological system,Psychological resilience,Species richness,Per capita,Geography,Sociology,Socio-ecological system,Social theory,Social movement,Ramification,Organic production,Spatial ecology,Relative species abundance,Metagenomics,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Food systems,Sustainability,Sociology,Socio-ecological system,Life span,Geography,Erosion,Manure,Environmental pollution,Environmental health","Mary K.

Albeit conversion to organic farming frequently comes along with a decline in crop yields, proponents of organic farming emphasize the sustainability of that system particularly because of improving organic matter-related soil quality. Based on recent research on mechanisms driving soil organic matter turnover, however, it rather appears that low-input agro ecosystems may convert to smaller efficiency in terms of substrate use by heterotrophs which may affect soil organic matter storage in the long run.

1371,Sustainable Pest Management for Cotton Production: A Review,2007-01-01,Agronomy for Sustainable Development,10.1051/AGRO:2007042,"Cotton cultivation, often highlighted for its excessive consumption of plant protection products, is taken as a model to illustrate the development of the ideas and practices of crop protection over the last 50 years. Cotton is grown in 69 countries on 30–35 million hectares and the production exceeded 20 million tones of lint in recent years. Despite the continual improvement in the performance of chemical control strategies, harvest losses remain very high, of about 30%. The largest consumer of pesticides in the world, the cotton production system has the advantage of having been an experimental model for many crop protection programmes under various agronomic conditions and in the presence of diverse pest complexes. Without attempting an exhaustive bibliography, this review explores how and why the ideas underlying crop protection have significantly evolved since the advent of synthetic pesticides. After a spectacular demonstration of yield growth through the application of chemical control, cotton production was rapidly confronted by the secondary effects of this control. These included the appearance of evolved insecticide resistance and the appearance of new damage caused by pests considered up to then as of only secondary importance. In extreme cases, the economic viability of the production systems themselves have been compromised following increases in the application rate and frequency of insecticidal treatments. In general, harvest losses have remained high despite the constantly improving technical performance of pest control chemicals. Two models of the future of crop protection can be drawn: total pest management which involves the eradication of pests, and integrated pest management (IPM), which aims at the management of pest populations below economic thresholds by a mixture of chemical control and a suite of alternative control measures. The first method, total pest management is limited in agricultural systems to particular cases in which the pest in question has no significant alternate hosts in the vicinity of the crop system. On the other hand, the application of IPM is constrained both by the difficulties in exploiting the concept of an ‘intervention threshold’ and by the limitations of many of the specific non-chemical techniques proposed, but does have the advantage of taking into consideration the full pest complex in a cropping system. In practice, it has been a calendar schedule, largely of insecticidal treatments, established on the basis of earlier local observations which has been most widely adopted by growers. This strategy has produced significant improvements in production in the cotton producing countries of francophone Africa and elsewhere. This has led to area-wide integrated pest management which takes into account the potential for natural factors to regulate populations in a specific region. In cotton production, biological control by introduction and acclimation of beneficial arthropods has not been notably successful because of the difficulty of developing a suite of beneficial organisms capable of responding effectively to the diversity of pests in the system, the annual nature of the crop, and the disrupting effects of chemical control measures directed against the remaining pests. Only inundative biological control has had significant success and then in particular cases where the pressure of chemical insecticides has been reduced. More benefit is to be obtained from the active conservation of the indigenous fauna of beneficial organisms. In spite of an increased general environmental awareness, in practice it has been the growth of evolved resistance to pesticides which has had the dominant role in constraining the growers to a more rational use of control strategies. These can be illustrated by the development of window strategies for control measures across the growing season, initially in Australia. The reduction in chemical control treatments made possible by the efficacy of genetically modified cotton has shown the positive role that indigenous natural enemies can play. At the same time, however, there has been a growth in the importance of pest species which are unaffected by Bt toxins. For example, the sucking pests are progressively coming to displace the vegetative and fruit feeding caterpillars as key pests of Bt cotton. Taking into account the spatio-temporal dimension of natural population regulatory factors has led to changes in agricultural practices and production systems. In cotton, for example, production systems maintaining permanent ground cover, are having increasing success. Intercropping and trap cropping have been favourable to the maintenance of beneficial arthropod complexes and unfavourable to the growth of pest populations. This new design context for crop protection in general and for cotton in particular, in applying the principles of agroecology, moves towards the concept of a truly sustainable agriculture. This implies a change of strategy towards a total systems approach to sustainable pest management, characterised by a movement from a paradigm of pest control field-by-field, through farm-by-farm and agroecosystem-by-agroecosystem, to a landscape by landscape approach.","Sustainable agriculture,Pest control,Mechanical pest control,Integrated pest management,Crop protection,Bt cotton,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,History,Epistemology,Economic history,Sociology,Social science,Scientific progress,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation,Species richness,Pest control,PEST analysis,Push–pull strategy,Push pull,Push and pull,Predation,Pesticide,Integrated pest management,Zoology,Predator,Predation,Terrestrial ecosystem,Marine ecosystem,Eutrophication,Sugar beet,Sugar,Population,Pesticide resistance,Insecticidal crystal proteins,Insect","Jean-Philippe Deguine,Pierre Ferron,Derek Russell,Thomas S.

1372,The effect of ground vegetation management on competition between the ants Oecophylla longinoda and Pheidole megacephala and implications for conservation biological control,2011-01-01,Crop Protection,10.1016/J.CROPRO.2011.01.006,"In tropical Africa and Asia, two species of the predatory ant genus, Oecophylla, play a crucial role in protecting tree crops against pests and enhancing the quality of fruits and nuts. As predatory effectiveness is influenced by the presence of other dominant ant species, understanding the ecological factors at work in agroecosystems lies at the basis of conservation biological control. Over three and a half years, the effect of ground vegetation management on the beneficial tree-nesting ant Oecophylla longinoda (Latreille) and its competitor, the ground-nesting ant, Pheidole megacephala (Fabricius), was studied in a citrus orchard in Tanzania. When ground vegetation was present, P. megacephala tolerated O. longinoda and to some extent cohabited with this ant in citrus trees. However, after clean cultivation, P. megacephala displaced O. longinoda from tree crowns and became the sole occupant of the majority of trees. Displacement could be reversed by reversing the weed management regime, but this took time. Two years after the establishment of ground vegetation about half of the trees were colonized by Oecophylla only. Maintaining ground vegetation in tree crop plantations benefits the establishment and abundance of Oecophylla over Pheidole and is recommended in order to improve the efficiency of biological control of tree pests. The use of Amdro ant bait (hydramethylnon) to control P. megacephala is discussed. Boosting agroecological innovations, such as the one described in this paper, could benefit smallholder producers.","Vegetation,Pheidole megacephala,Pheidole,Oecophylla longinoda,Megacephala,Hydramethylnon,Ecology,Botany,Biology,Amdro,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation,Predation,Pest control,Integrated pest management,SAFER,Profit (economics),Natural enemies,Weaver ant,Supply and demand,Participatory action research,Weed,Predation,PEST analysis,Predation,Pheidole megacephala,Nest,Pheidole megacephala,Hydramethylnon,Ecology,Weaver ant,Pest control,Orchard,Software deployment,Nest,Mutualism (economic theory),Weaver ant,Sustainability,Permaculture","Z.S.K.

Governments have taken over a major role in defining organic farming by creating legal standards. Many countries all over the world have established a certification and accreditation system in order to protect the justified expectations of consumers with regard to processing and controlling the product quality of organic goods and to protecting producers from fraudulent trade practices. As they are relevant to international trade, these standards do not only influence the organic farming movement on the national level but also have a converse impact across national borders. Organic farming was established in a bottom-up process as farmers aimed to design sustainable ways of using natural resources. Farmers' traditional knowledge and their awareness of ecological, as well as, of social affairs was the main base for the development of organic farming.

To remedy this situation, improved field margins (IFMs) will be introduced as a new ecological compensation type in the Swiss Lowlands. IFMs are extensively managed, sown species- and flower-rich vegetation strips which provide both habitats for a wide range of species and valuable structures for the ecological network. However, the success of ecological compensation measures depends strongly on their acceptance by farmers and the general public. In summer 2004, we investigated in a case study the attitudes of 108 Swiss people to IFMs directly in the field. Study participants were asked to rate the attractiveness of IFMs of different species richness and composition that were presented to them, to explain their rating and to estimate the number of species present. In addition, they were asked to imagine a field margin of their particular liking, to describe it, and to state their opinion on several aspects of IFMs. Study participants responded very positively to species-rich vegetation. The more species-rich an IFM was perceived to be, the more it appealed to them. Species richness and general diversity were named as the main reasons for a positive rating. Study participants strongly approved the establishment of improved field margins. The positive rating and high acceptance of IFMs in this study indicate that they may be a successful new tool for biodiversity enhancement in intensively used agricultural landscapes.","Vegetation,Species richness,Species diversity,Habitat,Global biodiversity,Environmental resource management,Ecology,Ecological network,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroecology,Statistical model,R language,Failure data,Wildlife conservation,Species richness,Landscape-scale conservation,Species richness,Pest control,PEST analysis,Social psychology,Psychology,Nature connectedness,Phobias,Nature connectedness,Mythology,Woodland,Ruderal species,Plant community,The Symbolic,Symbolic interactionism,Sustainable development,Pollen,Parasitism,PEST analysis,Pollinator,Nectar,Foraging,Perception,Norm (social),Landscape ecology","Xenia Junge,Katja A.

Although issues of climate change have received most attention, other global changes will have more immediate impacts on crop productivity and health. These changes include the phenomenal advances in modern industrial output, especially in China and India, in mechanization, in communications technology and advertizing, in transportation networks and connectivity, as well as demographic shifts toward urban centers. Driven by policies around food security, market impacts on crop production, and trade regulations, these changes will define crop production systems into the future, impacting rice biodiversity and ecosystem function and giving rise to new pest and disease scenarios. This paper presents a framework for a holistic approach to ‘rice ecosystem health’ aimed at securing food production while protecting farmer, consumer and ecosystem health. Recent advances in environmentally friendly agriculture, including ecological engineering, are central to the sustainability and resilience of rice ecosystems; but require support from policy to ensure their best effects. This paper introduces some recent advances in the methods of ecological engineering based on research conducted in the Philippines.","Sustainability,Psychological resilience,Natural resource economics,Food security,Food processing,Ecosystem health,Ecology,Ecological engineering,Business,Agroecology,Agriculture","Finbarr G.

However, for some species such as the skylark, the diet composition remains poorly known across its wintering range. On the basis of gizzards collected in mid-winter over a 10-year interval and in two regions of Western France, we quantified the contribution of seeds and investigated whether the diet differed between sexes, regions and period and whether seeds entered the diet with respect to their size, nutritive value or their spring occurrence within the farmland landscape. Also, the amount of seeds that birds need to consume for meeting their daily energy requirements was assessed by simulation and compared with estimates measured in captive individuals. Thirty-eight seed species belonging to 16 families were identified in gizzards. All species but one were weeds, and cereal grains were absent from all gizzards. The diet differed slightly between sexes but contrasted between regions and periods. We found no clear evidence for a selective intake based on seed traits. Conversely, our results suggest that weed seeds would enter the diet with respect to their relative occurrence. Our simulation indicated that birds should ingest about 8 g (4200-5600 seeds) to meet their daily requirements. A mean value of 6.7 g per day was measured in captive skylarks. These results suggest that the maintenance of rich weed habitats is a crucial issue for populations of skylarks that overwinter in agricultural landscapes of Western France.","Weed,Mean value,Habitat,Energy requirement,Ecology,Diet composition,Biology,Arable land,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agricultural landscapes,Software engineering,Software analytics,Reference software,Statistical hypothesis testing,Statistical assumption,Ordination,Land use,Intensive farming,Integrated farming,Valuation (finance),Sustainable agriculture,Nonmarket forces,Ecology,Botany,Biology,Stellaria media,Predation,Population,Organic farming,Nest,Mixed farming,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide resistance,Weed science,Weed control,Weed,Woodland,Weed,Species richness","Cyril Eraud,Emilie Cadet,Thibaut Powolny,Sabrina Gaba,François Bretagnolle,Vincent Bretagnolle,R Core Team,K.

I conducted a survey of vegetable farmers in Northern Cartago and the Ujarras Valley, Costa Rica, in 2003–2004 with the goal of explaining differences in pesticide intensity with reference to socioeconomic, political economic, and agroecological characteristics and relationships. Using ordinary least squares regression models, this paper explores the factors that influence pesticide use intensity in potato and squash production. Results indicate that many variables strongly influence pesticide intensity, including variables related to the farmer, farm household, political-economic relationships, the biophysical environment, and agroecological relationships. Conclusions discuss the need for an integrated approach to adequately understand pesticide intensity and potential policy interventions including agroecological education and extension, increased enforcement of pesticide residue limits in the national market, and land reform to allow for longer fallow periods.","Vegetable farming,Socioeconomic status,Pesticide residue,Pesticide,Ordinary least squares,Land reform,Economics,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Qualitative research,Psychology,Management science,Quality management system,Labour economics,International relations,Variable cost,Technological change,Small farm,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Sustainability,Self reliance,Social exclusion,Political ecology,Natural resource,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization,Statistics,Statistical theory,Statistical significance,Third world,Political science,Political economy,Sustainability,Pesticide,Externality,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability","Ryan E.

Even though the concepts of ecosystem services and natural infrastructure are maturing, their application in concrete engineering design is currently lacking due to their ambiguous definitions and a lack of methods that allow for the combined consideration of ecosystem and technical approaches in engineering design. This article proposes and discusses a new functional organization analysis (FOA) method for the comparative analysis and design of supply systems for basic needs (i.e., water, energy or food). This method allows for the analysis of the organization of system functions as well as underlying technical and ecosystem structures and associated processes. On this basis the method allows one to gather data, information, and knowledge about alternative system designs, and analyze their synergies. The theoretical and conceptual background of the proposed FOA method is presented, along with a case study regarding sustainable food supply systems in Southwestern Ontario.","Sustainable engineering,Sustainable agriculture,Food systems,Engineering design process,Engineering,Ecosystem services,Ecology,Ecological engineering,Basic needs,Agroecology,Sociology,Pedagogy,Humanities,Water supply,Introduced species,Goods and services,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Viable system model,Systems thinking,Systems methodology,Natural language processing,Mathematics,Concept map,Systems engineering,Product design,Engineering management,Valuation (finance),Sustainability science,Sustainability organizations,Soil organic matter,Organic farming,No-till farming,Typology,Resource management,Natural resource management,Species richness,Pest control,PEST analysis","Johannes Halbe,Jan Adamowski,Elena M.

1411,"Epilogue: global food security, rhetoric, and the sustainable intensification debate",2014-01-01,Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability,10.1016/J.COSUST.2014.09.004,"The need to feed nine billion people in 2050 has given rise to widespread debate in science and policy circles. The debate is largely framed in neo-Malthusian terms, and elements of global food security (resilience of the food system, food quantity and quality, right to and access to food) demand equal attention. High-intensive agriculture, which enabled population growth and food for a large proportion of the global population, is often regarded as incompatible with current environmental (and social) sustainability. Because of the often problematic nature of high-intensive industrialized agriculture, sustainable agricultural intensification has been called an oxymoron. Pathways to sustainably intensify agriculture vary from business-as-usual to claims that a radical rethinking of our agricultural production is imperative. Three terms have been coined to differentiate such pathways. Whereas conventional intensification, that is business-as-usual, is uncontroversial (but often considered unlikely to be able to achieve environmental sustainability), the phrases sustainable intensification and ecological intensification both have a complex history. Although one could think that they have similar meanings, the phrases represent very different perspectives in discourses in science and policy circles. The terms Utopians and Arcadians are introduced for adherents of those perspectives. We observe that they both devote insufficient attention to inevitable trade-offs. Agricultural intensification in developing countries was greatly accelerated by the Green Revolution, which largely bypassed sub-Saharan Africa. Discontent with that outcome has led to a plethora of new terms to indicate more successful next steps for sub-Saharan agriculture. Industrialized agriculture as currently practised in developed countries will not provide a universal solution. This epilogue of the special issue and the literature herein show that intense debates on sustainable agricultural intensification are needed. Such debates on intensification demand reflection on the role of scientists with regard to their uses of current and the generation of novel knowledge.","Sustainability,Population growth,Green Revolution,Food systems,Food security,Environmental resource management,Economics,Economic growth,Development economics,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Land use,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Science policy,Science communication,Public administration,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Greenhouse gas,Food systems,Land grabbing,Food security,Ecosystem services,Livelihood,Green Revolution,Food security,Zinc,Phytic acid,Nutrient,Sustainable agriculture,Soil conservation,Integrated pest management,Terrestrial ecosystem,Sustainable yield,Soil biodiversity","Thomas W Kuyper,Paul C Struik,H.

In this study, a regional N management approach was developed based on the cost of the agricultural response to N application rates from 1,726 on-farm experiments to optimize N management across 12 agroecological subregions in the intensive Chinese smallholder maize belt. The grain yield and GHG emission intensity of this regional N management approach was investigated and compared to field-specific N management and farmers' practices. The regional N rate ranged from 150 to 219 kg N ha−1 for the 12 agroecological subregions. Grain yields and GHG emission intensities were consistent with this regional N management approach compared to field-specific N management, which indicated that this regional N rate was close to the economically optimal N application. This regional N management approach, if widely adopted in China, could reduce N fertilizer use by more than 1.4 MT per year, increase maize production by 31.9 MT annually, and reduce annual GHG emissions by 18.6 MT. This regional N management approach can minimize net N losses and reduce GHG emission intensity from over- and underapplications, and therefore can also be used as a reference point for regional agricultural extension employees where soil and/or plant N monitoring is lacking.","Nitrogen management,Greenhouse gas,Grain yield,Emission intensity,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural soil science,Agricultural extension,Soil water,Soil salinity control,Sodium adsorption ratio,Regional science,Political science,Physical science,Environmental science,Environmental resource management,Climate change,Radiative forcing,Environmental science,Atmospheric sciences,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Yearbook,Library science,Economics,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Water quality,Phosphorus,Nitrogen,Sustainability,Precision agriculture,Information system","Liang Wu,Xinping Chen,Zhenling Cui,Weifeng Zhang,L.

Field based assessment of technologies needs to move beyond production and economic performance to include environment, social and human condition. In this study we systematically consider all five domains of SI based on participatory action research (PAR) initiated in 2012 at three Central Malawi sites that varied in agroecology from low to high potential. Fifteen SI indicators were assessed for four technologies: sole maize (Zea mays L.) with 0 and recommended fertilization (69 kg N ha− 1 and 9 kg P ha− 1), pigeonpea (Cajanus Cajun (L.) Millsp.)-maize intercrop (half rate fertilizer), and doubled up legume rotation (DLR, a pigeonpea-groundnut intercrop) sequenced with maize at half rate fertilizer in that phase. Through radar charts SI performance and tradeoffs were visualized, and causal loop analysis allowed identification of research gaps. SI indicator assessments included crop performance from on-farm trials, profitability, modeled probability of food sufficiency, risk of crop failure and ratings of technologies by women farmers who were engaged in evaluation of technologies through participatory research. The PAR included six mother trials, 236 baby trial farmers and a survey that was carried out with 324 farmers (baby trial farmers plus control farmers) to document socio-economic factors and management practices on focal fields. Replicated mother trials further provided the basis for simulation modeling (APSIM) of weather-associated crop failure risk and slow processes such as soil carbon (C) accrual. Radar charts were used to visualize SI performance of the technologies. Environmental performance of the two pigeonpea-diversified technologies was variable, but generally high compared with sole maize systems, due to gains in vegetative biomass, duration of cover and biological nitrogen (N) fixation. Maize production and economic assessment varied by site, and with steeper tradeoffs for legume diversification in the mesic site, less so in the marginal site. The domains of social and human capacity building were superior for legume integration, notably in terms of diverse diet, food security and farmer preferences (notably, female farmers generally favored legume crops). Performance varied by site with legume systems most beneficial at the most marginal site, including less risk of crop failure than unfertilized maize. Causal loop analyses identified regulators of SI that require further attention, notably: crop-livestock conflicts and opportunities, male-female control of legume crop production, and residue management. Overall, the SI indicators framework provided a systematic means to consider tradeoffs and opportunities associated with novel crop combinations and management practices.","Simulation modeling,Profitability index,Participatory action research,Food security,Economics,Diversification (marketing strategy),Crop,Causal loop diagram,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Systems simulation,Simulation modelling,Simulation,Nitrogen management,Management practices,Environmental resource management,Nitrogen cycle,Incentive,Fertilizer,Monoculture,Intercropping,Herbivore,Rural area,Nonfarm payrolls,Job creation,Sustainable food production,Research council,Political science,Sustainable agriculture,Monoculture,Green Revolution,Sustainability,Procedural justice,Food systems","Sieglinde S.

In these intensively managed farming systems, inorganic fertilizers are commonly used, with important agronomic, economical and ecological consequences. This study reviews the relationship between fertilizer application, coffee yield and quality indicators and soil chemical properties in coffee farms of the Los Santos region in Costa Rica. The mean nitrogen (N) input rate in farms employing inorganic fertilizer was 212 ± 16.7 kg ha−1 y−1. Yield reported by farmers had a positive marginally significant relationship with nutrient application rates. Cup quality attribute responded positively to calcium oxide (CaO) applications. Variables related to production and quality indicators were number of fungicide applications, soil exchangeable calcium (Ca) and acidity, elevation of the terrain, and number of stems per plant. Soil exchangeable Ca was positively correlated with the ratio of crop yield per unit of applied N fertilizer. In those farms with higher N input rates, soil pH was significantly lower. We suggest that the N saturation hypothesis developed for temperate forests under N atmospheric deposition is applicable to this perennial agroecosystem. This hypothesis predicts changes in the soil chemistry and nutrient retention capacity, and a reduction of Net Primary Productivity (NPP).","Soil water,Soil pH,Soil chemistry,Soil acidification,Fertilizer,Crop yield,Biology,Agronomy,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Soil water,Soil pH,Soil classification,Terrestrial ecosystem,Nitrogen cycle,Nitrogen,Statistics,Principal component analysis,Multivariate statistics,Nitrogen management,Management practices,Environmental resource management,Temperate forest,Saturation (chemistry),Nitrogen deposition,Vegetation,Temperate climate,Species richness,Sustainability,Specialty coffee,Revenue,Toxicity,Soil water,Soil pH,Sowing,Nitrous oxide,Nitrogen,Water resources,Nutrient management,Nutrient cycle","Sebastian Castro-Tanzi,Thomas Dietsch,Natalia Urena,Lucia Vindas,Mark Chandler,J.H.

The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is an agroecologically based methodology for crop management that raises yields by reducing rather than increasing inputs. This article explains with scientific justifications how it is possible to produce more food with less seed (lower plant density), less water, less fertilizer and agrochemicals, and often less labor. Lowering costs raises farmers’ incomes by more than their production increases. With SRI, reductions are made also in climate-change impacts and greenhouse gas emissions.","System of Rice Intensification,Sustainable agriculture,Greenhouse gas,Fertilizer,Economics,Climate change,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agrochemical,Agriculture,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource,Phyllosphere,Microbiology,Microbial ecology,System of Rice Intensification,Resource poor,Irrigation,Soil ecology,Soil biology,Environmental science,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization,Water supply,Water resources,Water resource management,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Soil organic matter,Symbiosis,Siderophore,Rhizosphere,Yield risk,System of Rice Intensification,Risk aversion","Norman Uphoff,David Tilman,Christian Balzer,Jason Hill,Belinda L.

Starting from the agricultural soil in our food basket these heavy metals and metalloids, like - Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Sn, Hg,Pb and others, showing significant toxic impacts. The intensification of agricultural land-use and changes in farming practices along with technological advancement has led to heavy metal pollution in soil. Metals/ metalloids concentrations in the soil are increasing at alarming rate due to modern day agricultural practices as these could not be degraded and affect plant growth, food safety and soil microflora. The biological and geological reorganization of heavy metal depends chiefly on green plants and their metabolism. Metal toxicity has direct effects and importance to flora that forms the integral component of ecosystem. Altered biochemical, physiological and metabolic processes are found in plants growing in regions of high metal pollution. However, metals like Cu, Mn, Co, Zn and Cr are required in trace amounts by plants for their metabolic activities.

The growing industrialization of the food system has led to a greater availability of food, along with an increasing risk perception and awareness in consumers. At the same time, there is an increasing resistance from citizens to the dominant model of production and a growing demand for healthy food. As a consequence, an increasing number of social networks have been formed worldwide involving the collaboration between producers and consumers. One of these networks, the Ecovida Agroecology Network, which operates in Southern Brazil, involves farming families, non-governmental organizations, and consumer organizations, together with other social actors. Using a qualitative approach based on participant observation and an analysis of documents, the article examines this network. The theoretical framework used is social innovation, which is commonly recognized as being fundamental in fostering rural development. Results show that Ecovida has instigated innovations that relate to its horizontal and decentralized structure, its participatory certification of organic food, and its dynamic relationship with the markets based on local exchanges and reciprocal relations. Furthermore, such innovation processes have been proven to impact on public sector policies and on the increasing cooperation between the social actors from rural and urban areas.","Social network,Public sector,Participant observation,Industrialisation,Food systems,Environmental resource management,Economics,Economic growth,Consumer Organizations,Agroecology,Agriculture,Social science,Short food supply chains,Rural development,Vitality,Sociology,Social science,Sociology,Social science,Social innovation,Quality assurance,Purchasing,Organic product,Humanities,Botany,Biology,Supply chain,Social network,Social capital,Social capital,Rural area,Public economics,Sociology,Humanities,Economy","Oscar José Rover,Bernardo Corrado de Gennaro,Luigi Roselli,Henk Renting,Terry K Marsden,Jo Banks,Stefan Neumeier,Bettina B.

Specifically, we ask if agroecology can lead to improved food security and human health among vulnerable smallholder farmers in semi-humid tropical Africa. The empirical evidence comes from a cross-sectional household survey (n = 1000) in two districts in Malawi, a small country in semi-humid, tropical Africa. The survey consisted of 571 agroecology-adoption and 429 non-agroecology-adoption households. Ordered logistics regression and average treatment effects models were used to determine the effect of agroecology adoption on self-reported health. Our results show that agroecology-adoption households (OR = 1.37, p = 0.05) were more likely to report optimal health status, and the average treatment effect shows that adopters were 12% more likely to be in optimal health. Furthermore, being moderately food insecure (OR = 0.59, p = 0.05) and severely food insecure (OR = 0.89, p = 0.10) were associated with less likelihood of reporting optimal health status. The paper concludes that with the adoption of agroecology in the semi-humid tropics, it is possible for households to diversify their crops and diets, a condition that has strong implications for improved food security, good nutrition and human health.","Tropics,Socioeconomics,Participatory action research,Immunology,Food security,Empirical evidence,Crop diversity,Biology,Average treatment effect,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Wasting,Surgery,Severe Acute Malnutrition,Socioeconomic status,Population,Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys,Summit,Population,Nationality,Statistics,Propensity score matching,Mathematics,Truncation,Statistics,Sampling (statistics),Subsidy,Green Revolution,Government,Weighting,Statistics,Right heart catheterization,Socioeconomics,Population,Market access,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Socioeconomics,Rural area,Zero Budget Farming,Natural farming,Mixed farming","Hanson Nyantakyi-Frimpong,Joseph Kangmennaang,Rachel Bezner Kerr,Isaac Luginaah,Laifolo Dakishoni,Esther Lupafya,Lizzie Shumba,Mangani Katundu,Robert E Black,Cesar G Victora,Susan P Walker,Zulfiqar A Bhutta,Parul Christian,Deon Filmer,Lant H.

Using focus groups, a household survey, and analysis of soil samples we characterized farming systems and quantified indicators of resilience, which we contextualized with a qualitative analysis of distributions of power and access to rights and resources. In Mato Grosso, where diversified agriculture is a marginal presence in an industrialized agricultural landscape, none of the communities were achieving participant-defined threshold levels of any measured indicator of resilience. However, farmers who were members of a marketing cooperative selling produce through a federal public procurement program had significantly greater agrobiodiversity, plant-available soil phosphorus, household food self-sufficiency, and access to stable markets. Our pilot study suggests that the convergence of grassroots mobilization and political-institutional change is a central leverage point for developing more resilient food systems.","Psychological resilience,Land reform,Human settlement,Food systems,Food sovereignty,Environmental resource management,Environmental protection,Economics,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural biodiversity,Umbrella species,Regional Red List,Red List Index,Water resources,Sustainability,Socio-hydrology,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Socio-ecological system,Vegetation,Native forest,Legislation,Water cycle,Physical geography,Global warming,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource,Globalization,Geopolitics,Genealogy,Tropics,Pasture,Land use,Zero Budget Farming,Natural farming,Mixed farming,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Food systems","Jennifer Blesh,Hannah Wittman,Norman Myers,Russell A.

Season-long heat stress can reduce photosynthesis and accelerate senescence; if extreme heat stress is experienced during flowering, both rice and wheat may also experience decreased pollen viability and stigma deposition, leading to increased grain sterility. Where farmers are unable to implement within-season management adaptations, significant deviations from expected climatic conditions would affect crop growth, yield, and therefore have important implications for food security. The influence of climatic conditions on crop growth have been widely studied in growth chamber, greenhouse, and research station trials, although empirical evidence of the link between climatic variability and yield risk in farmers’ fields is comparatively scarce. Using data from 240 farm households, this paper responds to this gap and isolates the effects of agronomic management from climatic variability on rice and wheat yield risks in eight of Pakistan’s twelve agroecological zones. Using Just and Pope production functions, we tested for the effects of crop management practices and climatic conditions on yield and yield variability for each crop. Our results highlight important risks to farmers’ ability to obtain reliable yield levels for both crops. Despite variability in input use and crop management, we found evidence for the negative effect of both season-long and terminal heat stress, measured as the cumulative number of days during which crop growth occurred above critical thresholds, though wheat was considerably more sensitive than rice. Comparing variation in observed climatic parameters in the year of study to medium-term patterns, rice, and wheat yields were both negatively affected, indicative of production risk and of farmers’ limited capacity for within-season adaptation. Our findings suggest the importance of reviewing existing climate change adaptation policies that aim to increase cereal farmers’ resilience in Pakistan, and more broadly in South Asia. Potential agronomic and extension strategies are proposed for further investigation.","Psychological resilience,Pollen,Greenhouse,Food security,Economics,Crop,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Adaptive capacity,South asia,Natural resource economics,Malnutrition,Hot Temperature,Growing season,Greenhouse effect,Tropics,Representative Concentration Pathways,Food security,Tropics,Temperate climate,Subtropics,Simulation modeling,Oryza sativa,Global warming,Precipitation,Greenhouse effect,Global warming,Microeconomics,Greenhouse gas,Global warming,Water-use efficiency,Water use,Population,Vulnerability,Subsistence economy,Subsistence agriculture,Zea mays,Oryza,Environmental monitoring","Muhammad Arshad,T.

This challenge was tackled in the Atlantic Rainforest biome (Brazil), where a participatory trial with agroforestry coffee systems was carried out, followed by a participatory systematisation of the farmers experiences. Our objective was to identify the main tree species used by farmers as well as their criteria for selecting or rejecting tree species. Furthermore, we aimed to present a specific inventory of trees of the Leguminosae family. In order to collect the data, we reviewed the bibliography of the participatory trial, visited and interviewed the farmers and organised workshops with them. The main farmers’ criteria for selecting tree species were compatibility with coffee, amount of biomass, production and the labour needed for tree management. The farmers listed 85 tree species; we recorded 28 tree species of the Leguminosae family. Most trees were either native to the biome or exotic fruit trees. In order to design and manage complex agroforestry systems, family farmers need sufficient knowledge and autonomy, which can be reinforced when a participatory methodology is used for developing on-farm agroforestry systems. In the case presented, the farmers learned how to manage, reclaim and conserve their land. The diversification of production, especially with fruit, contributes to food security and to a low cost/benefit ratio of agroforestry systems. The investigated agroforestry systems showed potential to restore the degraded landscape of the Atlantic Rainforest biome.","Rainforest,Introduced species,Food security,Diversification (marketing strategy),Biome,Biology,Biodiversity,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Umbrella species,Regional Red List,Red List Index,Sustainability,Soil quality,Poverty,Marketing,Engineering,Ecotourism,Morelia,Latin Americans,Ecology,Habitat,Framing (construction),Ecology,Geography,Forestry,Atlas (anatomy),Tropics,Empirical literature,Citizen journalism,Project management,Program evaluation,Process management,Rhizobia,Nitrogen fixation,Genetic structure,Systems design,Soil conservation,Participatory development","Helton N.

The policy will increase the rice planting area, the loss of remaining wetlands, and environmental pollution, with intensive application of fertilizers and heavy use of pesticides. The key to resolving this conflict is to bring rice production in compliance with wetland conservation and sustainable agriculture. An operational, sound regulatory program is needed to improve China’s wetland conservation. Using wetland conservation in the US as an example, we argue that more effective technical guidelines for wetland inventory and monitoring are necessary to support the implementation of the regulatory program. Agricultural conservation programs are also needed to stop further wetland loss from agricultural usages. An ecoagricultural strategy and practice should be adopted for rice production to reduce pollution and loss of remaining wetlands.

This was examined through the community capitals framework which allows for the use of a systems approach to inventory and analyse assets and wealth stocks within the community. Individual interviews were conducted in the summer of 2013 with members of the farm cooperative to explore the relationship between the farm and the community, and the way tourism to the farm has improved community capitals. Overall, this study demonstrated the ability for agroecotourism to help support goals of food security, beyond acting only as a tool for economic diversification, but also by influencing other community capitals. The study also adds to the literature on agroecotourism, tourism development in socialist contexts, and the way in which tourism can help support and grow sustainable agriculture.","Tourism,Sustainable agriculture,Socialism,Food security,Environmental resource management,Economics,Diversification (marketing strategy),Community development,Agroecology,Agriculture,Tunstall coding,Theoretical computer science,Skill development,Qualitative property,Qualitative comparative analysis,Natural language processing,Qualitative research,Qualitative property,Qualitative Evaluations,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Social capital,Natural capital,Individual capital,Sustainable development,Resource management,Natural resource management,Social capital,Rural sociology,Rural economics,Viewpoints,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Stakeholder,Perception,Marketing,Sociology,Social network,Social infrastructure","Lauren N.

The political economy-inspired literature on developing country agro-exports maintains that export crops are pesticide intensive – or, more generally, environmentally destructive – while local and national market crops are less pesticide intensive, or environmentally benign. If used to draw conclusions about the impact of national market versus export market expansion, this view has significant limitations, most importantly the comparison of high-commodity value export crops with low-commodity value crops for national market. To overcome this and other limitations of prior analyses, this paper addresses the question: how does market orientation influence pesticide intensity where the same crops are grown for both the national market and for export? Data from a survey of Costa Rican vegetable farmers are used to compare pesticide intensity of 27 vegetable crops, five of which are produced for both national and export markets. The general pattern that emerges is that national market vegetables are more pesticide intensive than export vegetables in the area. Yet, controlling more for the crop variable is important, and specific comparisons of the five vegetables grown for both markets – carrot, chayote, corn, green beans, and squash – illustrate that market orientation alone does not determine pesticide intensity, but that it is jointly influenced by regulatory risk, crop value, and pest susceptibility, among other factors. Continued attention to both political economy and ecological processes in “second nature” will allow political ecology to make important contributions to understanding pesticide problems and implementing agroecological solutions.","Political ecology,Pesticide,Market orientation,Globalization,Environmental impact assessment,Economics,Developing country,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Qualitative research,Psychology,Medical education,Qualitative research,Psychology,Management science,Variable cost,Technological change,Small farm,Procurement,Organizational change,Marketing,Sociology,Social science,Political ecology,Sociology,Social science,Politics,Public administration,Political science,International development,Sustainability,Industrialisation,Food systems,Social science,Philosophy of science,Outline of social science,Political ecology,Pastoralism,National park","Ryan E.

1425,Nutritional functional trait diversity of crops in south‐eastern Senegal,2017-01-01,Journal of Applied Ecology,10.1111/1365-2664.13026,"Ecological trait diversity metrics have been used to highlight the impacts of agriculture. Such metrics can also be used to include human nutrition—an important dimension of human well-being—into assessments of agroecosystem function and services. Although crop yield is a common agroecosystem metric, it does not capture the multiple ways in which agriculture impacts people and the environment. Given that nutrient composition of crops is a set of functional traits, I apply a suite of functional diversity metrics—functional divergence, richness, evenness and dispersion—to crop production data from south-eastern Senegal. I also propose a new nutritional diversity metric—potential nutrient adequacy—to assess nutritional outcomes of different agricultural systems. I demonstrate high variability in nutritional diversity and potential adequacy among households and administrative departments in south-eastern Senegal. I show that most households produce nutritionally similar crops, rather than crops with high nutritional diversity. As a result, most households currently do not produce enough nutrients to meet minimal nutritional requirements. Using a scenario approach, I show that intensifying yields of staple crops and diversifying production to include non-staples can increase nutritional production and the potential to meet nutritional needs. I further show that a combination of intensification and diversification is needed to meet the need for a diverse group of nutrients. Policy implications. I develop a new metric that indicates the potential for a food system to meet the nutritional requirements of a population. This tool will allow practitioners to assess the nutritional adequacy of a food system and to design food systems that optimize nutritional outcomes. Application of this metric to different production scenarios showed that combining yield intensification with crop diversification is important to meeting full nutritional targets for smallholder agriculture. There is a broader need for incorporating other social and socio-ecological traits into trait-based assessments of agroecosystems.","Trait,Population,Food systems,Ecology,Diversification (marketing strategy),Crop diversity,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural diversification,Soil water,Soil organic matter,Soil carbon,Weighting,Trait,Statistical hypothesis testing,Species richness,Species evenness,Null model,Species richness,Per capita,Geography,Welfare,Socioeconomic status,Prenatal care,Trait,Species richness,Gamma diversity,Soil water,Soil respiration,Rhizosphere,Sustainable agriculture,Malnutrition,Livelihood,Land use,Human nutrition,Food supply,Trait theory,Trait,Environmental resource management","Stephen A.

1426,RISK AND MAIZE-BASED CROPPING SYSTEMS FOR SMALLHOLDER MALAWI FARMERS USING CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGIES,2013-01-01,Experimental Agriculture,10.1017/S0014479713000306,"SUMMARY Agricultural production in southern Africa is constrained by numerous factors, including low soil fertility, frequent droughts and flooding, limited access to fertilizers and the use of unsustainable management techniques that increase soil erosion rates. Conservation agriculture (CA) is based on the principles of minimum soil disturbance, crop residue retention and crop rotations. CA systems have been proposed to alleviate the negative externalities associated with conventional crop management systems. This study was conducted to examine the riskiness of economic returns of CA technologies based on maize grain yield evaluated in 12 target communities in Malawi from 2005–2011. On average, maize grain yields on both CA treatments exceeded the conventional control treatment by 22.1–23.6%, with differences more distinct in low altitude areas with low rainfall and frequent seasonal dry spells. Stochastic dominance analysis suggest that CA technologies would be preferred by risk-averse farmers, with corresponding differences in risk premiums (compared to conventional maize production systems) ranging between US$40 and US$105. However, these rankings are sensitive to the agroecological zones where the experiments were conducted. The risk premiums associated with the CA technologies in low elevation regions are unambiguous. Riskaverse farmers in higher elevations may need substantial incentives to adopt some CA technologies.","Soil fertility,Flooding (psychology),Cropping,Crop rotation,Crop residue,Conservation agriculture,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agricultural productivity,World Reference Base for Soil Resources,Unified Soil Classification System,USDA soil taxonomy,Sustainable agriculture,Soil retrogression and degradation,Soil quality,Sustainability,Productive capacity,Ecosystem services,Water resource management,Soil resources,Environmental science,Rural poverty,Public service,Poverty,Water use,Tillage,Rainwater harvesting,Tropics,Tobit model,Tillage,Water content,Tillage,Surface runoff,Risk management,Risk aversion,Risk assessment,Soil movement,Linkage (mechanical),Information system","A.

They are characterized by the preponderance and emphasis on mixed crop–animals systems across a variety of agroecological zones. Mixed farming is the backbone of agriculture, many categories of which are models of diversification, efficiency and resilience in Asia. In global terms, small farms in Asia account for an estimated 87% of all farms of under two hectares of land. About 52% of these farms have <1 ha, with the smallest sizes (0.3–0.6 ha) being found in China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. There are three types of small farms: in irrigated areas, rainfed zones and plantation agriculture. The first category greatly benefited from policy support and massive resource inputs through the‘green revolution’, while the second was bypassed by it, but continues to produce the bulk of the ruminant meats and milk. The third type remains neglected.

1428,Linking species traits to agroecosystem services: a functional analysis of weed communities,2018-01-01,Weed Research,10.1111/WRE.12283,"There is a growing interest in the use of functional approaches for the study of weed assemblages, to disentangle underlying processes determining their composition and dynamics. Functional approaches are based on the assumption that weed community composition and dynamics can be best explained by a set of species traits expressing their response to agricultural disturbance. This knowledge should help develop more sustainable, ecologically based weed management systems. Trait‐based data required for this kind of analysis are available from various sources, but most of them either cover mainly non‐weedy species or, in the case of weed‐focussed trait databases, they cover a limited number of species. In this work, we present a trait database for 240 weed species common throughout Europe, including not only response traits but also effect traits, that is linked to selected agroecosystem services and disservices. A case study is presented where our weed trait database is used in conjunction with appropriate statistical analysis to highlight the distribution of weed functional groups in soyabean crop communities from an experiment including different tillage and weed management systems. Finally, we discuss the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of this functional approach. By highlighting the links between weed species and agroecosystem (dis)services, this approach could be a useful resource for scientists, farm managers and policymakers.","Weed control,Weed,Trait,Global biodiversity,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Agriculture,Software engineering,Software analytics,Reference software,Statistics,Multivariate statistics,Multivariate analysis,Trait,Terminology,Plant traits,Terrestrial ecosystem,Sustainable yield,Soil biodiversity,Trait,Plant functional type,Life history theory,Total human ecosystem,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Trait,Plant community,Life history theory,Plant community,Null model,Niche,Plant ecology,Functional approach,Ecology,Taxonomy (biology),Systematics,Geography","P Bàrberi,G Bocci,S Carlesi,L Armengot,J M Blanco‐Moreno,F X Sans,R Core Team,Stéphane Dray,Anne-Béatrice Dufour,Cyrille Violle,Marie-Laure Navas,Denis Vile,Elena Kazakou,Claire Fortunel,Riccardo Bommarco,David Kleijn,Simon G.

When combined under thoughtful management, cover cropping and crop-livestock integration under no-till systems can benefit from unexpected synergies due to their unique features of plant-animal diversification and complex agroecosystem functions. Mimicking the nutrient coupling/decoupling processes of natural ecosystems by diversifying plant and animal components of no-till integrated crop-livestock operations is an essential feature of the design of agroecological systems that support self-regulating feedbacks and lend resilience while increasing productivity and ecosystem service provision. Focusing on grazing animals as drivers of agroecosystem change, we highlight the benefits of grazed cover crops in rotation with cash crops for primary and secondary production and for soil physical, chemical, and biological parameters. However, careful management of grazing intensity is imperative; overgrazing drives soil deterioration, while light to moderate grazing enhances overall system functioning and allows for the generation of emergent properties.","Sustainable development,Overgrazing,Integrated production,Food security,Ecosystem services,Cover crop,Cash crop,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Real income,Per capita,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Population,Marine ecosystem,Habitat destruction,Global warming,Food systems,Food security,Supply chain,Scenario analysis,Public debate,Psychological resilience,Monoculture,Incentive,Sustainability,Milk production,Greenhouse gas,Seed dispersal,Scarabaeinae,Scarabaeidae,Spite,Rangeland management,Rangeland,Wetland,Watershed,Water resources,Weed control,Soil organic matter,Pest control","Paulo César de Faccio Carvalho,Caitlin Adair Peterson,Pedro Arthur de Albuquerque Nunes,Amanda Posselt Martins,William de Souza Filho,Vanessa Thoma Bertolazi,Taíse Robinson Kunrath,Aníbal de Moraes,Ibanor Anghinoni,David Tilman,Christian Balzer,Jason Hill,Belinda L.

1430,The role of models for multicriteria evaluation and multiobjective design of cropping systems for managing weeds,2014-01-01,Weed Research,10.1111/WRE.12112,"Weeds are both harmful for crop production and important for biodiversity, while herbicides can pollute the environment. We thus need new cropping systems optimising all cultural techniques, reconciling agricultural production, herbicide reduction and biodiversity conservation. Here, we show how to (i) develop models quantifying the effects of cropping systems on weed dynamics, (ii) integrate interactions between weeds and other organisms, (iii) predict the impact on production and biodiversity and (iv) use the model for multicriteria evaluation and multiobjective design of cropping systems. Among the existing weed dynamics models, we chose the one closest to our requirements to illustrate these different steps, that is, FlorSys which predicts multispecific weed dynamics as a function of cultural techniques and pedoclimate. We have illustrated the development of interaction submodels with the example of a crop pathogen whose propagation is increased when infecting grass weeds. To evaluate the weed flora impact, predicted weed densities were translated into indicators of harmfulness (crop yield loss, technical harvest problems, harvest pollution, field infestation, crop disease increase) and biodiversity (weed species richness and equitability, trophic resources for birds, insects and pollinators). Simulations were run over several years and with different weather scenarios (i) to optimise cultural techniques to control harmful weeds, (ii) to analyse the impact of changing agricultural practices (e.g. simplified tillage and rotations, no-till, temporary crops) on weed density, species and trait composition and (iii) to evaluate cropping systems for their ability to reconcile agricultural production and biodiversity, thus identifying levers for designing sustainable cropping systems.","Weed,Tillage,Cropping system,Cropping,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Statistics,Ridge,Response surface methodology,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide,Weed,Sustainable solutions,Resistance mutation,Weed control,Weed,Trophic level,Weed control,Weed,Sustainable agriculture,Water balance,Parametrization,Nitrogen balance,Soundness,Simulation modeling,Risk analysis (engineering),Weed,Sustainable agriculture,Pollinator,Seedling,Seed predation,Negative relationship,Stellaria media,Predation,Population","Nathalie Colbach,Luc Biju-Duval,Antoine Gardarin,Sylvie Granger,Sébastien H.M.

This paper examines the status of an expert-informed list of underutilized crops in Latin America and analyses how the most common features of underuse apply to these. The analysis pays special attention to if and how existing international policy and legal frameworks on biodiversity and plant genetic resources effectively support or not the conservation and sustainable use of underutilized crops. Results show that not all minor crops are affected by the same degree of neglect, and that the aspects under which any crop is underutilized vary greatly, calling for specific analyses and interventions. We also show that current international policy and legal instruments have so far provided limited stimulus and funding for the conservation and sustainable use of the genetic resources of these crops. Finally, the paper proposes an analytical framework for identifying and evaluating a crop’s underutilization, in order to define the most appropriate type and levels of intervention (international, national, local) for improving its status.","Sustainable development,Sustainability,Sovereignty,Latin Americans,Food security,Environmental resource management,Economics,Climate change,Biodiversity,Agroecology,Threatened species,Psychology,Performance art,Sociology,Research council,Environmental ethics,Microbial Genetic,Good agricultural practice,Food systems,Sustainable development,Sustainability,National Policy,Vegetation,Intensive farming,Government,Social impact,Resource management,Research areas,Subsistence agriculture,Public policy,Natural resource economics,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Political economy,Species richness,Population genetics,Outcrossing,Plant breeding,Geography,Domestication","Gea Galluzzi,Isabel López Noriega,Edward Osborne Wilson,Patricia J.

This study assessed the status of P on organic farms in Europe using soil test results for extractable P. Data was obtained from published literature, unpublished theses, and various national and regional databases of soil test values. Most of the data (15,506 observations) came from field scale soil tests, but in some cases (1272 observations) values had been averaged across a farm. Farm scale and field scale data were analysed separately and the impact of farm type (arable, dairy, grassland, horticulture, mixed, poultry, unknown) was assessed. Soil test results were assigned to P classes from very low (P class 1) to very high (P class 5). The farm scale data came primarily from Norway, Sweden and Switzerland and did not indicate deficiencies in extractable P; 93% of farms fell into class 3 or above. The majority of the field scale data came from Germany and indicated sufficient or higher levels of P availability for arable and grassland systems on 60% of fields; the remaining fields had low or very low available P. Adaptations in organic systems may improve P uptake and utilization efficiency allowing yields to be maintained in the short-term, nevertheless there is cause for concern about the long-term P sustainability of some organic farming systems in Europe. This highlights the need to reassess allowable P inputs in organic farming systems to improve overall sustainability.","Sustainability,Soil test,Soil quality,Organic farming,Grassland,Chemistry,Arable land,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Truncated mean,Studentized range,Statistics,Soil science,Population,Organic farming,Rhizosphere,Phosphorus,Microbial inoculant,Tropical soils,Sustainable agriculture,Soil water,Soil microbiology,Soil chemistry,Rhizosphere,Soil science,Soil salinity,Soil organic matter,Nutrient,Environmental science,Crop,Shoot,Population,Lateral root,Soil water,Soil organic matter,Soil fertility,Organic farming,Industrial engineering,Engineering","Julia Cooper,Eleanor Y.

1435,The economic potential of agroecology: Empirical evidence from Europe,2019-01-01,Journal of Rural Studies,10.1016/J.JRURSTUD.2019.09.003,"This article discusses the economic dimensions of agroecological farming systems in Europe. It firstly theoretically elaborates the reasons why, and under what conditions, agroecological farming systems have the potential to produce higher incomes than farms that follow the conventional logic. This theoretical exposition is then followed by a presentation of empirical material from a wide range of European countries that shows the extent to which this potential is being realized. The empirical data draw upon different styles of farming that can be described as ‘proto-agroecological’: approaches to farming that are agroecological by nature, but which may not necessarily explicitly define themselves as agroecological. The empirical material that we present shows the huge potential and radical opportunities that Europe's, often silent, ‘agroecological turn’ offers to farmers that could (and should) be the basis for the future transformation of European agricultural policies, since agroecology not only allows for more sustainable production of healthier food but also considerably improves farmers' incomes. It equally carries the promise of re-enlarging productive agricultural (and related) employment and increasing the total income generated by the agricultural sector, at both regional and national levels. While we recognise that agroecology is a worldwide and multidimensional phenomenon we have chosen to limit this analysis to Europe and the economic dimension. This choice is made in order to refute current discourses that represent agroecology as unproductive and unprofitable and an option that would require massive subsidies.","Sustainability,Subsidy,Phenomenon,Natural resource economics,Environmental resource management,Empirical evidence,Empirical data,Economics,Economic potential,Agroecology,Agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Food systems,Business,Agricultural economics,Agricultural development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Population,Valuation (finance),Sociology,Food systems,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Sustainability,Organic farming,Land use,Whole food,Sustainable agriculture,Social science,Vertical integration,Proposition,Petroleum industry,Sustainability,Natural resource economics,Livestock","Jan Douwe van der Ploeg,Dominique Barjolle,Janneke Bruil,Gianluca Brunori,Stephen R.

The dramatic increase in published research over the last 20 years reflects not only the existence of policy support for organic farming in some countries but also the availability of government funding for research on organic farming. This has resulted in a broadening out of organic research from privately funded, specifically organic research organizations, into universities and mainstream research institutes. In parallel, publication of research results from organic farming has increasingly appeared in refereed literature in addition to literature sources more available to farmers and advisors. Research scientists from Europe, North America and Australasia have all made important contributions to the peer-reviewed literature. The literature is dominated by comparisons of organic and other forms of agriculture, although in many cases these comparisons are not fully valid. Research directed specifically at organic systems is often much more valuable in developing improved production systems than comparative research. Research on organic farming embodies both holistic and reductionist research approaches. Trans-disciplinary research also has an important role to play in understanding the complexities of the ecological approach to agriculture typified by organic farming. Working within the principles and standards of organic agriculture will mean that some research will always be specific to organic production systems.

It is based on the holistic combination of multiple management measures rather than on the sum of single methods, each of them having only small effects on pests reduction. Thus, to analyse the interactions between IPM measures and to evaluate the sustainability of their implementation, we require an approach considering the whole cropping system (CS), i.e. a functional entity whose complexity is more than the sum of its parts. A network of European experiments at the CS level was set up recently, and aimed at sharing data and expertise to enhance knowledge of IPM. Comparison of existing methodologies highlighted a diversity of CS designs and experimental layouts. We deduced that the concept of CS itself was viewed differently among scientists, and this affected experimental protocols. Other differences were related to the research context and objectives. Some experiments aimed to explore very innovative strategies and generated knowledge on both their effects on the agroecosystem and their ability to satisfy a set of performance targets, while others aimed to provide quickly adoptable solutions for local farmers in line with the current socio-economic constraints. In some research programmes, the experiment was part of the CS design process — and tested CS were regularly revised based on an continuous improvement loop — while in other cases CS were kept stable across years so as to enable the evaluation of their long-term cumulative effects. A critical aspect contributing to the diversity among CS experiments was the distinction between a factorial design of experimental CS and systemic approaches: factorial experiments allowed quantification of the effects of each IPM component regardless of the consistency between components defining the CS. In contrast, systemic approaches focused on the overall evaluation of CS designed with consideration of their consistency, hence maximising their ability to meet the objectives. Because CS experiments represent a huge investment in terms of economics and time, preliminary reflections of the relevance of the experimental strategy is of critical importance.","Systems analysis,Sustainability,SWOT analysis,Integrated pest management,Design process,Cropping,Biology,Biological regulation,Agronomy,Agroecology,Sustainability,Population,Natural resource economics,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Type I and type II errors,Terminology,Statistical inference,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Natural resource,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Species richness,Pest control,PEST analysis,Total human ecosystem,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Environmental resource management,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Soil quality,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Integrated farming","Martin Lechenet,Violaine Deytieux,Daniele Antichi,Jean-Noel Aubertot,Paolo Barberi,Michel Bertrand,Vincent Cellier,Raphael Charles,Caroline Colnenne-David,Silke Dachbrodt-Saaydeh,Philippe Debaeke,Thierry Doré,Pascal Farcy,Cesar Fernandez-Quintanilla,Gilles Grandeau,Cathy Hawes,Lionel Jouy,Eric Justes,Roman Kierzek,Per Kudsk,Jay Ram Lamichhane,Françoise Lescourret,Marco Mazzoncini,Bo Melander,Antoine Messean,Anna-Camilla Moonen,Adrian C.

However, its socioeconomic dimensions receive little attention from academia. This study helps to clarify the socioeconomic principles of agroecology by first identifying a list of principles in popular and scientific literature and, as a second step, by putting the principles to the test of a qualitative study of two Belgian organizations. Agribio is a grain cooperative, and Les Grosses Legumes is a network of consumers, farmers, and the members of an association set up to organize the production and distribution of vegetable boxes. Semi-directed interviews of the various actors linked to these organizations were conducted and then analyzed through an approach inspired by the convention theory in order to reveal the principles that the stakeholders have adopted. The main findings are then made explicit by analysis of four strong agreements (which concern the two organizations’ marketing schemes, a Participatory Guarantee System set up by...","Socioeconomic status,Socio economy,Scientific literature,Qualitative research,Public relations,Food systems,Environmental resource management,Economics,Convention theory,Citizen journalism,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Typology,Technological transitions,System innovation,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Social movement,Ramification,Organic production,Principles of Organic Agriculture,Organic product,Organic movement,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Food systems,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Social organization,Sociology,Socialization,Economy,Systems of innovation,Scrutiny,Path dependence,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Political science,Valuation (finance),Sociology,Food systems","Antoinette M.

1439,Developing a set of simulation-based indicators to assess harmfulness and contribution to biodiversity of weed communities in cropping systems,2014-01-01,Ecological Indicators,10.1016/J.ECOLIND.2014.07.028,"Abstract Weeds are both harmful for agricultural production and an essential component of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Therefore, new cropping systems aiming at both maximising weed-related biodiversity and minimising weed harmfulness are needed. New cropping systems are now increasingly designed with weed dynamics models but these usually only consider weed densities or crop yield losses. The present paper proposed a set of indicators for assessing the impact on crop production and biodiversity of weed communities simulated with a cropping system model. Five harmfulness indicators were developed to take account of the criteria most frequently listed by farmers via an internet survey: (1) crop yield loss, (2) harvest pollution by weed seeds, stems and leaves, (3) harvesting problems due to green weed biomass blocking the combine, and (4) field infestation represented by weed biomass averaged over cropping seasons. A fifth indicator was added, i.e. (5) the increase in crop disease (i.e. take-all disease of cereals) in the presence of weeds. The biodiversity indicators were chosen in collaboration with ecologists. Two indicators reflect the weed contribution to vegetal biodiversity: (1) species richness and (2) Pielou's index for species equitability. Three other indicators were developed to assess weeds as a trophic resource for other organisms in the agro-ecosystems: (3) the number of weed seeds present on soil surface in autumn and winter to feed field birds, (4) lipid-rich seeds on soil surface in summer to feed insects such as carabids, and (5) weed flowers in spring and summer to feed domestic bees. These indicators were tested in a series of contrasted cropping systems identified in farm surveys and simulated with F lor S ys . Analyses of variance showed that the cropping system and the crop sequence presented the highest impact on indicator values. Weather scenario and pedoclimate had little effect. Antagonisms and synergies between weed-related harmfulness and biodiversity were identified with Spearman correlations. Harmfulness indicators were all positively correlated, except for additional disease risk which was at best poorly correlated with other indicators. Most weed-related biodiversity indicators were also positively correlated, except species richness which was negatively correlated with species equitability, bird resource and insect resource. Weed harmfulness generally increased with increasing weed-related biodiversity. These correlations were though weak, and others were negative, showing that increased biodiversity could occur with decreased harmfulness (e.g. trophic resource for insects vs. yield loss or field infestation). Consequently, there are cropping systems that reconcile agricultural production and biodiversity.","Weed,Species richness,Ecology,Cropping system,Cropping,Crop yield,Biology,Biodiversity,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agricultural productivity,Weed control,Weed,Pesticide,Species richness,Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Species diversity,Predation,Pesticide,Specific leaf area,Soil carbon,Secondary succession,Whole food,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Weed control,Weed,Trophic level,Surface runoff,Soil organic matter,Land use,Water balance,Parametrization,Nitrogen balance,Soundness,Simulation modeling,Risk analysis (engineering),Pollinator decline,Pollinator,Habitat","Delphine Mézière,Sandrine Petit,Sylvie Granger,Luc Biju-Duval,Nathalie Colbach,E.-C.

The after effects of green revolution have encouraged the farmers to take up organic farming. This paper has reviewed the global and Indian scenario with reference to organic farming. In India, the cultivated land under certification is 2.8 Mha only. The key issues emerging in organic farming include yield reduction in conversion to organic farm, soil fertility enhancement, integration of livestock, certification constraints, ecology, marketing and policy support. The potential for organic farming, especially in the dryland regions has been discussed. It has been argued that organic farming is productive and sustainable, but there is a need for strong support to it in the form of subsidies, agricultural extension services and research.","Zero Budget Farming,Social science,Principles of Organic Agriculture,Natural resource economics,Natural farming,Mixed farming,Integrated farming,Extensive farming,Engineering,Ecological farming,Agroecology,Sustainability,Statistics,Principles of Organic Agriculture,Sustainable agriculture,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Soil organic matter,Soil fertility,Soil carbon,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Sustainability,Self reliance,Organic farming,Natural farming,Mixed farming,Sustainability,Permaculture,Land use,Remedial education,Political science,Per capita,Species richness,PEST analysis,Organic product,Soil water,Soil quality,Soil fertility,Soil management,Soil fertility,Soil conservation","B.

Where response data is scarce, determination of representative response functions can be strengthened by using results from homologous crop growing conditions. Maize (Zea mays L.) nutrient response functions were selected from the Optimization of Fertilizer Recommendations in Africa (OFRA) database of 5500 georeferenced response functions determined from field research conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa. Three methods for defining inference domains for selection of response functions were compared. Use of the OFRA Inference Tool (OFRA-IT; http://agronomy.unl.edu/OFRA) resulted in greater specificity of maize N, P, and K response functions with higher R2 values indicating superiority compared with using the Harvest Choice Agroecological Zones (HC-AEZ) and the recommendation domains of the Global Yield Gap Atlas project (GYGA-RD). The OFRA-IT queries three soil properties in addition to climate-related properties while the latter two options use climate properties only. The OFRA-IT was generally insensitive to changes in criteria ranges of 20–25% used in queries suggesting value in using wider criteria ranges compared with the default for information scarce crop nutrient response functions.","Yield gap,Sub saharan,Nutrient,Inference,Fertilizer,Crop,Chemistry,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Weather station,Spatial variability,Spatial ecology,Watershed,Oceanography,Meteorology,USDA soil taxonomy,Soil survey,Soil science,USDA soil taxonomy,Soil science,Soil retrogression and degradation,Reforestation,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Yield gap,Simulation modeling,Growing degree-day,Woody plant,Water use,Water resources,Soil fertility,Potassium,Phosphorus,Fertilizer,Biology,Agricultural science,Fertilizer,Biology,Agronomy","Charles S.

The “transfer of technology” discourse developed with the professional U.S. extension service, reproducing its expert/lay power relations. Agroecology is emerging as a systems approach to preventing agricultural pollution. Its theoreticians argue that agroecology cannot be transferred like technology but must be extended through networks of participatory social learning. In California, hundreds of actors and dozens of institutions have cocreated agroecological partnerships using this alternative extension model. They have developed three alternative extension discourses to represent and explain their activities.

We analysed data from breeding trials and experimental reports to assess genetic gains in the single-cross varieties in terms of grain yield and agronomic traits in Northern China, Southwestern China and Yellow–Huai River Valley. Since the 1960s, the grain yield of single-cross varieties has increased linearly in all three regions. Plant height, ear rows and 100-seed weight have increased linearly (P < 0.05) with time, while ear length has decreased (P < 0.05). Planting density has increased (P < 0.05) in Yellow–Huai River Valley and Northern China, but no change in Southwestern China. Ear height and leaf number in Northern China and Southwestern China have increased linearly (P < 0.05) over time, but no change in Yellow–Huai River Valley. The growing period in Yellow–Huai River Valley has increased linearly (P < 0.05), while that of Northern China and Southwestern China has not changed. Our analysis showed that contribution of agronomic traits to grain yield differed between agroecological regions.

In the absence of empirical evidence, these papers assigned subjective values to extensive margin (productivity of new croplands over productivity of existing croplands). This paper fills the gap in this area and provides a new data set which estimates land productivity at 0.5° × 0.5° (longitude × latitude) grid-cell level using a process-based biogeochemistry model, the terrestrial ecosystem model (TEM) calibrated for a C4 crop. The results obtained from the TEM can be used in connection with economic models which are designed to assess land use changes induced by economic factors. To show a real application, a set of regional extensive margins are calculated based on the new data set. The calculated regional extensive margins are then introduced in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) economic model which has been frequently used to assess the land use implications of ethanol production. Finally, land use changes due to US ethanol production are examined using the augmented CGE model with the new extensive margins. The approach developed here provides estimates of extensive margins disaggregated by the country and agroecological zone, replacing the earlier assumption of a globally uniform value. Using these new parameter values, the estimation of land required for ethanol production is 25% lower than earlier published results.","Sustainable development,Land use,Environmental economics,Energy economics,Empirical evidence,Economics,Economic model,Computable general equilibrium,Biofuel,Agroecology,Second-generation biofuels,Low-carbon fuel standard,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Technological change,International trade,History,Rainfed agriculture,Multiple cropping,Irrigation,Renewable energy,Non-renewable resource,Environmental impact of the energy industry,Low-carbon fuel standard,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Greenhouse gas,Primary energy,Land use,Food security,Tropics,Terrestrial ecosystem,Temperate climate,World economy,Partial equilibrium,European union,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Land cover,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Greenhouse gas accounting","Farzad Taheripour,Qianlai Zhuang,Wallace E Tyner,Xiaoliang Lu,Timothy Searchinger,Ralph Heimlich,R.

The practices depicted in this case study contrast with common agroecological discourses, which assume native people’s agricultural techniques are consistently static and place-based. Rather than choose cultivation techniques based on an abstract notion of indigenous tradition, participants utilize the most appropriate practices for their new environment. Garden participants combine agricultural practices developed in Oaxaca with those learned while working on California farms. Through the process of community gardening, immigrants find a new interpretation of their own shifting indigenous identity, based on culinary and agrarian practices in a new place. Additionally, they form solidarities between historic ethnic divides of Triqui and Mixteco, based on newfound commonalities in the garden. This case study provides an important example of the current articulation, construction, and deployment of indigeneity in the context of migration and agriculture, and its implications for immigrant opportunities and futures.

AI outbreaks are frequent at village level due to environmental, ecological, agroecological, physical, social, and cultural factors, the underlying factor being poor hygienic conditions. Viral circulation is facilitated by the interactions of the integrated aquaculture, animal raising, horticulture agroecosystem, which relies in the peculiar integration of aquaculture (ponding), animal activities, and horticulture and by the connections with the live-bird market system. The interactions of these factors determine the complex system in which wild birds interact with domestic birds and in which people are constantly exposed to sources of infection, leading to the association between poverty and AI infection in humans.

1449,Review: An integrated graphical tool for analysing impacts and services provided by livestock farming.,2019-01-01,Animal,10.1017/S1751731119000351,"Livestock farming is criticized for negatively impacting the environment, concerns about animal welfare and the impact of excessive meat consumption on human health. However, livestock farming provides other underappreciated and poorly communicated benefits to society in terms of employment, product quality, cultural landscapes and carbon storage by grasslands. Few attempts have been made so far to simultaneously consider the services and impacts provided by livestock production. Here, we propose an integrated graphical tool, called the ‘barn’ to explicitly summarize the synergies and trade-offs between services and impacts provided by livestock farming. It illustrates livestock farming interacting with its physical, economic and social environment along five interfaces: (i) Markets, (ii) Work and employment, (iii) Inputs, (iv) Environment and climate, (v) Social and cultural factors. This graphical tool was then applied by comparing two contrasting livestock production areas (high livestock density v. grassland-based), and the dominant v. a niche system within a crop-livestock area. We showed the barn could be used for cross-comparisons of services and impacts across livestock production areas, and for multi-level analysis of services and impacts of livestock farming within a given area. The barn graphically summarizes the ecological and socio-economic aspects of livestock farming by explicitly representing multiple services and impacts of different systems in a simple yet informative way. Information for the five interfaces relies on available quantitative assessments from the literature or data sets, and on expert-knowledge for more qualitative factors, such as social and cultural ones. The ‘barn’ can also inform local stakeholders or policy-makers about potential opportunities and threats to the future of livestock farming in specific production areas. It has already been used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the diversity of services and impacts of livestock systems across Europe and is currently developed as a serious game for encouraging knowledge exchange and sharing different viewpoints between stakeholders.","Viewpoints,Sustainability,Social environment,Livestock,Environmental planning,Ecosystem services,Cultural landscape,Biology,Biochemistry,Animal welfare,Agroecology,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Tourism,Total human ecosystem,Provisioning,Toxicology,Monogastric,Livestock,Total human ecosystem,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Environmental resource management,Sustainable land management,Social value orientations,Respondent,Vocabulary,System framework,Natural resource,Sustainability,Strategic environmental assessment,Stakeholder,Water quality,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Systems thinking,Social issues,Social exclusion,Sustainable development,Functional ecology,Environmental resource management","Julie Ryschawy,Bertrand Dumont,Olivier Therond,Catherine Donnars,J.

1450,Spanish agriculture from 1900 to 2008: a long-term perspective on agroecosystem energy from an agroecological approach,2018-01-01,Regional Environmental Change,10.1007/S10113-017-1136-2,"According to the agroecological approach, energy analyses applied to agriculture should provide information about the structure and functions of the agroecosystem; in other words, about the maintenance of its fund elements, which sustain the flow of ecosystem services. To this end, we have employed a methodological proposal that adds agroecological EROIs to the existing economic EROIs. This methodology is applied here for the first time at the country level, and over a long-term historical period. The Spanish agroforestry sector, which is representative of Mediterranean agroclimatic conditions, has been studied on a decadal basis from 1900 to 2008, fully spanning its process of industrialization and modernization. The results show the loss of energy efficiency brought about by the industrialization of Spanish agriculture. The economic EROIs (FEROI, EFEROI and IFEROI) fell by 42, 93 and 12%, respectively. The shift towards livestock production and the dramatic increase in industrial inputs are the causes of this decline. With regard to agroecological EROIs, NPPact EROI and Biodiversity EROI fell by 6 and 15%, respectively. This suggests that the fund elements are being degraded and alerts us to low returns to nature in the form of un-harvested biomass available to aboveground and underground wildlife. Finally, Woodening EROI increased by 48%. Sixty percentage of this increment was due to the growth of woodland in areas freed from agricultural activities. However, this change in land use was partly due to feed imports from third countries where deforestation processes may well be taking place, an effect that has not been considered in the analysis.","Land use, land-use change and forestry,Land use,Industrialisation,Ecosystem services,Economics,Deforestation,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Temporal scales,Spatial heterogeneity,Habitat,Land use,Land management,Habitat,Land grabbing,Food security,Ecosystem services,Vegetation,Terrestrial ecosystem,Soil retrogression and degradation,Sustainability,Subsidy,Return on investment,Urbanization,Land use,Geography,Sustainability,Psychological resilience,Planetary boundaries,Operations research,Management science,Environmental resource management,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability","Gloria I.

1452,Forty research issues for the redesign of animal production systems in the 21st century,2014-01-01,Animal,10.1017/S1751731114001281,"Agroecology offers a scientific and operational framework for redesigning animal production systems (APS) so that they better cope with the coming challenges. Grounded in the stimulation and valorization of natural processes to reduce inputs and pollutions in agroecosystems, it opens a challenging research agenda for the animal science community. In this paper, we identify key research issues that define this agenda. We first stress the need to assess animal robustness by measurable traits, to analyze trade-offs between production and adaptation traits at within-breed and between-breed level, and to better understand how group selection, epigenetics and animal learning shape performance. Second, we propose research on the nutritive value of alternative feed resources, including the environmental impacts of producing these resources and their associated non-provisioning services. Third, we look at how the design of APS based on agroecological principles valorizes interactions between system components and promotes biological diversity at multiple scales to increase system resilience. Addressing such challenges requires a collection of theories and models (concept–knowledge theory, viability theory, companion modeling, etc.). Acknowledging the ecology of contexts and analyzing the rationales behind traditional small-scale systems will increase our understanding of mechanisms contributing to the success or failure of agroecological practices and systems. Fourth, the large-scale development of agroecological products will require analysis of resistance to change among farmers and other actors in the food chain. Certifications and market-based incentives could be an important lever for the expansion of agroecological alternatives in APS. Finally, we question the suitability of current agriculture extension services and public funding mechanisms for scaling-up agroecological practices and systems.","Psychological resilience,Process management,Incentive,Environmental resource management,Ecology of contexts,Certification,Biology,Biochemistry,Animal production,Agroecology,Agroecological restoration,Agriculture,Planetary boundaries,Humanity,Fresh water,Sustainable development,Poverty,Food security,Water scarcity,Water resources,Livestock,Socio-ecological system,Regime shift,Psychological resilience,Zoology,Warning system,Financial market,Urbanization,Sustainability,Population growth,Land grabbing,Food security,Ecosystem services,Terrestrial ecosystem,Sustainable yield,Soil biodiversity,Relative humidity,Nutrient density,Humidity,Poverty,Pastoralism,Need to know","B.

1453,Implementing ecological intensification in fish farming: definition and principles from contrasting experiences,2019-01-01,Reviews in Aquaculture,10.1111/RAQ.12231,"Ecological intensification is a new concept in agriculture that addresses the double challenge of maintaining a level of production sufficient to support needs of human populations and respecting the environment in order to conserve the natural world and human quality of life. This article adapts this concept to fish farming using agroecological principles and the ecosystem services framework. The method was developed from the study of published literature and applications at four study sites chosen for their differences in production intensity: polyculture ponds in France, integrated pig and pond polyculture in Brazil, the culture of striped catfish in Indonesia and a recirculating salmon aquaculture system in France. The study of stakeholders' perceptions of ecosystem services combined with environmental assessment through Life Cycle Assessment and Emergy accounting allowed development of an assessment tool that was used as a basis for co-building evolution scenarios. From this experience, ecological intensifica-tion of aquaculture was defined as the use of ecological processes and functions to increase productivity, strengthen ecosystem services and decrease disservices. It is based on aquaecosystem and biodiversity management and the use of local and traditional knowledge. Expected consequences for farming systems consist of greater autonomy, efficiency and better integration into their surrounding territories. Ecological intensification requires territorial governance and helps improve it from a sustainable development perspective.","Traditional knowledge,Sustainable development,Fishery,Environmental resource management,Environmental impact assessment,Emergy,Ecosystem services,Biology,Aquaculture,Agroecology,Agriculture,Underpinning,Planetary boundaries,Planet,Valuation (finance),Public good,Natural capital,Wild fisheries,Organic aquaculture,Offshore aquaculture,Sustainability,Management science,Knowledge-based systems,Engineering,Database,Sustainability science,Sustainability organizations,Sustainability,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Terrestrial ecosystem,Sustainable yield,Soil biodiversity,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant,Yield gap,Soil quality,Precision agriculture","Joël Aubin,Myriam Callier,Hélène Rey-Valette,Syndhia Mathe,Aurélie Wilfart,Marc Legendre,Jacques Slembrouck,Domenico Caruso,Eduardo Chia,Gérard Masson,Jean Paul Blancheton,Edi Ediwarman,Joni Haryadi,Tri Heru Prihadi,Jorge de Matos Casaca,Sergio T.J.

Interventions are urgently needed, but information is lacking on its geographic distribution and losses caused. Group discussions were held in 2013 in 121 sublocations in the major maize zones, and respondents were asked if they had heard about MLN, when they first observed it, the proportion of households affected, and the estimated yield loss in affected areas. Responses were used to estimate the proportion of maize lost in the community, and these results were interpolated and combined with maize production data to estimate quantities lost. Western Kenya suffered most with more than half of farmers affected, followed by Central and Eastern Kenya, with up to a third of farmers. Yield losses in affected areas were highest in Western Kenya, followed by the highlands (in Central Kenya and the Rift Valley) and at the coast, but were low in the drylands (in Eastern Kenya). Total maize losses in Kenya were estimated at 0.5 million ton per year, or 22% of the average annual production before MLN, with a value estimated at $180 million. Losses were concentrated in Western Kenya, in particular the moist transitional zone (58% of all maize lost) and the moist mid-altitudes (19%), but also in the highlands (17%). Losses were small in the drylands and at the coast. Urgent action is needed to help farmers cope. In the short term, they need to be informed about the disease and provided with advice on appropriate agronomic practices. In the long term, varieties resistant to MLN need to be developed, first for the moist transitional and moist mid-altitude zones and followed by the highlands, but ultimately for all agroecological zones.","Socioeconomics,Rift valley,Geographic distribution,Crop loss,Community survey,Biology,Annual production,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Zea mays,Whorl (botany),Plant virus,Tanzania,Sugarcane mosaic virus,Staple food,Western corn rootworm,Virus,Tombusviridae,Stemborer,PEST analysis,Infestation,Virus,Virology,Plant virus,Virus,Sugarcane mosaic virus,Potyvirus,Virus,Plant virus,Phloem,Virology,Sugarcane mosaic virus,Potyvirus,Weed control,Weed,Striga,Virus,Virology,Taqman rt pcr","Hugo De Groote,Francis Oloo,Songporne Tongruksawattana,Biswanath Das,A.

Agroecological crop protection is an attractive alternative based on the principles of agroecology. We present here this strategy using the case of Cucurbitaceae flies, which are the most important agricultural pests in Reunion. Research has been carried out on the bioecology of these insects and on the effectiveness of agroecological techniques. The main points are the following: the number of species of vegetable flies increased in the southern summer. Adult flies spend more than 90 % of their time on nonhost plants, with specific circadian rhythms. Several original agroecological techniques were designed, such as sanitation using augmentoria; trap plants, e.g., maize; adulticide bait; and the creation of habitats for predatory arthropods. Local growers are very satisfied with the results. They have reduced insecticide use with substantial cost savings and they have observed a decrease in losses and a lower phytosanitary workload. The education and training of students, professionals, and the general public has been a major aspect of this project. Increased knowledge of flies and agroecological management strategies of their populations can now be combined with modeling tools to facilitate the extension of the program to other areas or for educational purposes. Practices are currently being extended to other areas of the island and other countries of the Indian Ocean. This project is both a significant milestone for organic farming in Reunion and a precedent for other initiatives aimed at reducing or eliminating pesticides.","Tephritidae,Sanitation,Phytosanitary certification,Pesticide,Organic farming,Crop protection,Biology,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,Human ecology,Environmental science,Total human ecosystem,Environmental resource management,Ecosystem services,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Total human ecosystem,Species diversity,Geography,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation,Zoology,Trophic level,Species richness,Sustainability,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Global biodiversity,Environmental resource management,Environmental change,Sustainable agriculture,Measurement of biodiversity,Ecosystem services,Spatial heterogeneity,Spatial analysis,Landscape epidemiology","Jean-Philippe Deguine,Toulassi Atiama-Nurbel,Jean-Noël Aubertot,Xavier Augusseau,Morguen Atiama,Maxime Jacquot,Bernard Reynaud,Millenium Ecosystem Assessment,D.

Cocoa is grown in cultivation systems of varying ecological complexity. The plantations are highly susceptible to climate change impacts. Local cocoa producers mention heat waves, droughts, floods and plant diseases as the main impacts affecting plants and working conditions, and they associate these impacts with global climate change. From a sustainable regional development point of view, cocoa farms need to become more resilient in order to cope with the climate change related effects that are putting cocoa-based livelihoods at risk. This study assesses agroecosystem resilience under three different cocoa cultivation systems (successional agroforestry, simple agroforestry and common practice monocultures). In a first step, farmers’ perceptions of climate change impacts were assessed and eight indicators of agroecological resilience were derived in a transdisciplinary process (focus groups and workshop) based on farmers’ and scientists’ knowledge. These indicators (soil organic matter, depth of Ah horizon, soil bulk density, tree species diversity, crop varieties diversity, ant species diversity, cocoa yields and infestation of cocoa trees with Moniliophthora perniciosa) were then surveyed on 15 cocoa farms and compared for the three different cultivation systems. Parts of the socio-economic aspects of resilience were covered by evaluating the role of cocoa cooperatives and organic certification in transitioning to more resilient cocoa farms (interviews with 15 cocoa farmers combined with five expert interviews). Agroecosystem resilience was higher under the two agroforestry systems than under common practice monoculture, especially under successional agroforestry. Both agroforestry systems achieved higher cocoa yields than common practice monoculture due to agroforestry farmers’ enhanced knowledge regarding cocoa cultivation. Knowledge sharing was promoted by local organizations facilitating organic certification. These organizations were thus found to enhance the social process of farmers’ integration into cooperatives and their reorientation toward organic principles and diversified agroforestry.","Organic farming,Organic certification,Monoculture,Moniliophthora perniciosa,Economics,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecosystem,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural biodiversity,Socio-ecological system,Social network,Social learning,Sociology,Socio-ecological system,Social science,Population,Organic farming,Food systems,Socioeconomics,Probit model,Natural resource,Social science,Rural development,Medicine,Soil test,Soil science,Environmental science,Stock (geology),Soil organic matter,Profitability index,Zero Budget Farming,Natural farming,Mixed farming,Sustainable development,Peasant,Food sovereignty,Understory,Tropics,Theobroma","Johanna Jacobi,Monika Schneider,Patrick Bottazzi,Maria Pillco,Patricia Calizaya,Stephan Rist,Carl Folke,W.

The novel strategy of wet peatlands agriculture (paludiculture) may permit the production of bioenergy from biomass while avoiding large greenhouse gas emissions as occur during conventional crop cultivation on drained peat soils. Herein, we present the first greenhouse gas balances of a simulated paludiculture to assess its suitability as a biomass source from a climatic perspective. In a rewetted peatland, we performed closed-chamber measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide exchange in stands of the potential crops Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia, and Carex acutiformis for two consecutive years. To simulate harvest, the biomass of half of the measurement spots was removed once per year. Carbon dioxide exchange was close to neutral in all tested stands. The effect of biomass harvest on the carbon dioxide exchange differed between the 2 years. During the first and second year, methane emissions were 13–63 g m � 2 a � 1 and 2– 5g m � 2 a � 1 , respectively. Nitrous oxide emissions lay below our detection limit. Net greenhouse gas balances in the study plots were close to being climate neutral during both years except for the Carex stand, which was a source of greenhouse gases in the first year (in CO2-equivalents: 18 t ha � 1 a � 1 ). Fifteen years after rewetting the net greenhouse gas balance of the study site was similar to those of pristine fens. In addition, we did not find a significant short-term effect of biomass harvest on net greenhouse gas balances. In our ecosystem, ~17 t ha � 1 a � 1 of CO2-equivalent emissions are saved by rewetting compared to a drained state. Applying this figure to the fen area in northern Germany, emission savings of 2.8–8.5 Mt a � 1 CO2-equivalents could possibly be achieved by rewetting; this excludes additional savings by fossil fuel","Peat,Methane,Greenhouse gas,Fossil fuel,Carbon dioxide,Biomass,Biology,Biofuel,Bioenergy,Agronomy,Agroforestry","Anke Günther,Vytas Huth,Gerald Jurasinski,Stephan Glatzel,R Core Team,Gunnar Myhre,Drew Shindell,Julia Pongratz,Sadaf Alam,Thomas J.

The tensions between continuing short-term economic growth whilst investing in low-carbon technologies for long-term decarbonisation could be eased if there were significant financial and non-climate potential benefits of decarbonisation for these economies. This study explores some of the potential benefits for India, by analysing its long-term mitigation options in the context of global action towards a 2 °C target, using an energy systems model (The University College London TIMES Integrated Assessment Model, or TIAM–UCL) which represents India explicitly, as one of 16 global regions. The study finds that India could significantly over-achieve against a 2050 low-carbon target based on equal per capita emissions by 2050, at mitigation costs below the global carbon price, implying that it could earn significant revenues through selling international carbon credits, thereby offsetting some of the costs of decarbonisation. In addition, India would see much lower levels of fossil fuel consumption in a low-carbon scenario, thereby alleviating potential economic difficulties in securing access to adequate supplies of these fuels.","Waste management,Revenue,Renewable energy,Per capita,Natural resource economics,Fossil fuel,Energy system,Economics,Economic impact analysis,Economic growth,Carbon price,Carbon credit,World Energy Outlook,Subsidy,Renewable energy,Waste management,Thorium fuel cycle,Nuclear chemistry,Microeconomics,Energy efficiency gap,Efficient energy use,Wind power,Waste management,Small hydro,Wind power,Waste management,Solar water heating,Technology development,Power sector,Population,Technological transitions,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Secondary sector of the economy,Natural resource economics,Engineering,Subsidy,Solar power,Solar energy,Waste management,Thermal power station,Global warming","Ajay Gambhir,Tamaryn A.

1563,Five-dimensional interpolation: Recovering from acquisition constraints,2009-01-01,Geophysics,10.1190/1.3245216,"Although 3D seismic data are being acquired in larger volumes than ever before, the spatial sampling of these volumes is not always adequate for certain seismic processes. This is especially true of marine and land wide-azimuth acquisitions, leading to the development of multidimensional data interpolation techniques. Simultaneous interpolation in all five seismic data dimensions (inline, crossline, offset, azimuth, and frequency) has great utility in predicting missing data with correct amplitude and phase variations. Although there are many techniques that can be implemented in five dimensions, this study focused on sparse Fourier reconstruction. The success of Fourier interpolation methods depends largely on two factors: (1) having efficient Fourier transform operators that permit the use of large multidimensional data windows and (2) constraining the spatial spectrum along dimensions where seismic amplitudes change slowly so that the sparseness and band limitation assumptions remain valid. Fourier reconstruction can be performed when enforcing a sparseness constraint on the 4D spatial spectrum obtained from frequency slices of five-dimensional windows. Binning spatial positions into a fine 4D grid facilitates the use of the FFT, which helps on the convergence of the inversion algorithm. This improves the results and computational efficiency. The 5D interpolation can successfully interpolate sparse data, improve AVO analysis, and reduce migration artifacts. Target geometries for optimal interpolation and regularization of land data can be classified in terms of whether they preserve the original data and whether they are designed to achieve surface or subsurface consistency.","Stairstep interpolation,Sparse matrix,Optics,Offset (computer science),Multivariate interpolation,Missing data,Mathematics,Interpolation,Fourier transform,Fast Fourier transform,Spectral shape analysis,Seismic wave,Regularization (mathematics),Spectral density estimation,Short-time Fourier transform,Optics,Trilinear interpolation,Regular polygon,Mathematics,Telecommunications,Radon transform,Optics,Sampling (statistics),Optics,Nonuniform sampling,Seismology,Geomorphology,Geology,Window function,Mathematics,Low-pass filter,Vertical seismic profile,Superposition principle,Spectral signature,Seismology,Geology,Spatial reference system,Seismology,Sampling (statistics)","Daniel Trad,Bin Liu,Mauricio D.

1575,Direct and Market Effects of Enforcing Emissions Trading Programs: An Experimental Analysis,2006-01-01,Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization,10.2139/SSRN.536722,"Since firms in an emissions trading program are linked together through a permit market, so too are their compliance choices. Thus, enforcement strategies for trading programs must account for not only the direct effects of enforcement on compliance and emissions decisions, but also the indirect effects that occur because changes in enforcement can induce changes in permit prices. This paper uses laboratory experiments to test for these direct and indirect market effects. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find a direct effect of enforcement on individual violations, as well as a countervailing market effect through the permit price. Thus, the productivity of increased enforcement pressure to reduce noncompliance is partially offset by a countervailing price effect. Furthermore, there is no direct effect of enforcement on the emissions choices of firms, only a negative price effect. This suggests that the only way increased enforcement can have an impact on environmental quality is if it is large enough and applied widely enough to induce an increase in the equilibrium permit price.","Offset (computer science),Microeconomics,Industrial organization,Environmental quality,Enforcement,Emissions trading,Economics,Direct effects,Risk aversion (psychology),Risk aversion,Marginal utility,Status quo bias,Status quo,Prospect theory,Variable cost,Transaction cost,Microeconomics,Neoclassical economics,Managerial economics,Experimental science,Microeconomics,Market conditions,Financial incentives,Scarcity,Property rights,Microeconomics,Price system,Pareto principle,Microeconomics,Regulatory authority,Price of stability,Microeconomics,Taxpayer,Government,Experimental data,Reverse auction,Revenue equivalence,Proxy bid","James J.

However, the political feasibility of an emission trading scheme may crucially depend on the free initial allocation of emission permits to carbon-intensive industries in order to offset the reduction in profits. This paper aims to analyze these potential profit impacts and the possible compensation to affected generation companies through modeling the Australian National Electricity Market under a potential emission trading scheme. Historical emission-based and historical generation-based allocation approaches are used in this paper to calculate and compare the percentages of carbon permits that should be freely allocated.

It is not known whether risks of delayed intervention are offset by benefits of growth and maturation. We explored this question. Methods All 1618 infants admitted to our institution within 30 days after birth for a congenital heart defect since 2000 were analyzed. Birth details and admission progress notes were detailed on all. For infants requiring cardiac interventions, clinical conference records and progress notes enabled their management to be classified as either USUAL (normal timing and mode of intervention) or DELAYED (intentional delay for growth/maturation). The survival implications of birth weight and prematurity were examined via parametric multiphase methodology with bootstrap resampling. Subsequently, the impact of DELAYED management was sought in propensity-adjusted and multivariable time-related models. Results Low birth weight is a strong, robust and independent predictor of death within the first year of life ( P P P  = .88), even when adjusted via propensity score ( P  = 0.65) or multivariable analysis ( P  = 0.55). Major determinants of death in this very low-birth-weight population were antenatal diagnosis ( P  = .01), presence of congenital gastrointestinal defects ( P  = .07), or lesion type (all higher risk: anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, P  = .03; pulmonary atresia and intact septum, P  = .05; and truncus, P  = .01).

Economists propose tradable permit systems as a solution, but they are difficult to implement due to the nature of non-point sources. We present a pollution offset system for trading non-point source water pollution permits. Conventional pollution offset systems suffer from thin markets and transaction costs. In this paper, we show how to overcome these problems with a centrally managed common-pool market. We define permits as allowable nitrate loading to a groundwater aquifer. This trading system utilizes estimates of potential nitrate leaching from land uses, a set of transport coefficients generated from a simulation of nitrate transport in groundwater, an online trading system, and a linear program to clear the market. We illustrate the concept using a hypothetical case study.","Water quality,Water pollution,Pollution,Offset (computer science),Nonpoint source pollution,Nitrate transport,Microeconomics,Groundwater,Environmental economics,Economics,Aquifer,Social cost,Price system,Pigovian tax,Systems engineering,Modular programming,Modular design,Water quality,Pesticide,Nutrient pollution,Modular design,Groundwater,Environmental engineering,Water pollution,Transaction cost,Pollutant,Strategic dominance,Revenue,Private information retrieval,Supply and demand,Nutrient,Natural resource economics,Reservoir operation,Organizational structure,Microeconomics,Price system,Pareto principle,Microeconomics,Spot contract,Microeconomics,Mathematical optimization","R.

1665,Translating building legislation into a computer-executable format for evaluating building permit requirements,2016-01-01,Automation in Construction,10.1016/J.AUTCON.2016.04.008,"Abstract In this paper, we describe an approach to translating the written content of the Korean Building Act into a computer-executable format for the purpose of evaluating building permit requirements. Among the various applications of building information modeling (BIM), we focus on automated design assessment and its rule-making process, which has been performed by both architects and software developers. Compared to the conventional rule-making approach, which is integrated with rule-checking software, our suggested mechanism (KBimLogic) of converting rule sentences from the Korean Building Act into computer-executable code (KBimCode) is a software-independent approach that separates the rule-making and rule-checking processes. We use the rule-making approach to translate the Korean Building Act into an explicit code that focuses on building permit requirements. Building permit-related regulations are defined in the Korean Building Act, but some of the sentences are ambiguous, and some implicit definitions hinder translation into an explicitly defined computer-executable form. Some building permit-related requirements vary by building type, administrative district, permitted date, and as-built date; thus, it is critical to design computable rules independent of specific proprietary software. The building permit system in Korea changes (as it does in other countries), making it critical that code compliance rules be kept up-to-date. Our work is motivated by such fundamentals and suggests a logic rule-based mechanism for use by non-programmers and a user-friendly approach to the rule-making process. The scope and major components of our research are as follows: (1) noun phrases classify building objects and associated properties from the Korean Building Act; (2) verb phrases derive high-level methods to construct the actual rule-checking body; and (3) the logic rule-based mechanism processes natural language sentences. In the actual implementation for translation, this approach has been demonstrated by each database and a GUI-based application named KBimLogic, for generating KBimCode. The KBimCode, which contains a set of specific building permit requirements translated from sentences, can be imported into our code-checking software (KBimAssess) using a specific file format.","Verb,Software,Programming language,Noun phrase,Natural language,Legislation,File format,Executable,Computer science,Building information modeling,User experience design,System evaluation,Simulation,Systems engineering,Software,Semantics,Software portability,Software development,Programming language,Simulation,Object model,Interoperability,XML validation,XML framework,XML Schema Editor,Software engineering,Software,Norwegian,Information model,Data mining,Computer science,Systems engineering,Specific knowledge,Professional practice,Workflow,Real estate development,Real estate","Hyunsoo Lee,Jin Kook Lee,Seokyung Park,Inhan Kim,C.

1683,Natural mutations in a Staphylococcus aureus virulence regulator attenuate cytotoxicity but permit bacteremia and abscess formation,2016-01-01,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/PNAS.1520255113,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major bacterial pathogen, which causes severe blood and tissue infections that frequently emerge by autoinfection with asymptomatically carried nose and skin populations. However, recent studies report that bloodstream isolates differ systematically from those found in the nose and skin, exhibiting reduced toxicity toward leukocytes. In two patients, an attenuated toxicity bloodstream infection evolved from an asymptomatically carried high-toxicity nasal strain by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor repressor of surface proteins (rsp). Here, we report that rsp knockout mutants lead to global transcriptional and proteomic reprofiling, and they exhibit the greatest signal in a genome-wide screen for genes influencing S. aureus survival in human cells. This effect is likely to be mediated in part via SSR42, a long-noncoding RNA. We show that rsp controls SSR42 expression, is induced by hydrogen peroxide, and is required for normal cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity. Rsp inactivation in laboratory- and bacteremia-derived mutants attenuates toxin production, but up-regulates other immune subversion proteins and reduces lethality during experimental infection. Crucially, inactivation of rsp preserves bacterial dissemination, because it affects neither formation of deep abscesses in mice nor survival in human blood. Thus, we have identified a spontaneously evolving, attenuated-cytotoxicity, nonhemolytic S. aureus phenotype, controlled by a pleiotropic transcriptional regulator/noncoding RNA virulence regulatory system, capable of causing S. aureus bloodstream infections. Such a phenotype could promote deep infection with limited early clinical manifestations, raising concerns that bacterial evolution within the human body may contribute to severe infection.","Virulence,Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcal infections,Phenotype,Pathogen,Mutation,Microbiology,Immune system,Gene,Biology,k-mer,Variant Call Format,Stockholm format,Replicate,RNA-Seq,Outlier,k-mer,Sequence assembly,Paired-end tag,Surgery,Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcal infections,Surgery,Staphylococcus aureus,Respiratory disease,Surgical wound,Surgery,Staphylococcus aureus,Surgery,Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia,Staphylococcus aureus,k-mer,Statistical model,Software,Sequence assembly,Population,Genotyping Techniques,Whole genome sequencing,Transcriptome,RNA","Sudip Das,Claudia Lindemann,Bernadette C.

1689,Characterization of the limbal epithelial stem cell niche: novel imaging techniques permit in vivo observation and targeted biopsy of limbal epithelial stem cells.,2007-01-01,Stem Cells,10.1634/STEMCELLS.2006-0580,"It is anticipated that stem cell (SC) therapy will enable the regeneration of diseased tissues and organs. Understanding SC niches is an essential step toward realizing this goal. By virtue of its optical transparency and physical separation of SC and transient amplifying cell compartments, the human cornea provides a unique opportunity to visualize and observe a population of adult stem cells, limbal epithelial stem cells (LESCs), in their niche environment. To date, the characteristics of the LESC niche have remained unclear. State-of-the-art imaging techniques were used to construct a three-dimensional (3D) view of the entire human corneal limbus and identify the structural characteristics of the LESC niche. Two distinct candidate LESC niche structures were identified. Cells within these structures express high levels of the putative limbal stem cell markers p63{alpha} and ABCG2; however, current methods cannot identify for certain which exact cells within this cell population are truly LESCs. These structures could be located and observed in vivo in normal human subjects, but not in patients with clinically diagnosed corneal LESC deficiency. The distribution of these structures around the corneal circumference is not uniform. Biopsies targeted to limbal regions rich in LESC niche structures yielded significantly higher numbers of LESCs in culture. Our findings demonstrate how adult stem cell niches can be identified and observed in vivo in humans and provide new biological insight into the importance of LESC niche structures in maintaining normal LESC function. Finally, the concept of targeted biopsy of adult SC niches improves stem cell yield and may prove to be essential for the successful development of novel adult stem cell therapies.","Stem cell,Population,Niche,Limbal stem cell,Corneal limbus,Cornea,Cell biology,Cell,Biology,Adult stem cell,Stem cell niche,Stem cell biology,Stem cell,Stem cell transplantation for articular cartilage repair,Stem cell marker,Stem cell,Stem cell,Progenitor cell,Niche,Transplantation,Surgery,Pathology,Visual acuity,Transplantation,Surgery,Stem cell,Neuroscience,Genetics,Type IV collagen,Stem cell,Molecular biology,Stem cell,Progenitor,Limbal stem cell,Visual acuity,Transplantation,Surgery,Tissue homeostasis,Stem cell,Molecular biology","Alex J.

1702,Towards the Improved Discovery and Design of Functional Peptides: Common Features of Diverse Classes Permit Generalized Prediction of Bioactivity,2012-01-01,PLOS ONE,10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0045012,"The conventional wisdom is that certain classes of bioactive peptides have specific structural features that endow their particular functions. Accordingly, predictions of bioactivity have focused on particular subgroups, such as antimicrobial peptides. We hypothesized that bioactive peptides may share more general features, and assessed this by contrasting the predictive power of existing antimicrobial predictors as well as a novel general predictor, PeptideRanker, across different classes of peptides. We observed that existing antimicrobial predictors had reasonable predictive power to identify peptides of certain other classes i.e. toxin and venom peptides. We trained two general predictors of peptide bioactivity, one focused on short peptides (4–20 amino acids) and one focused on long peptides ( amino acids). These general predictors had performance that was typically as good as, or better than, that of specific predictors. We noted some striking differences in the features of short peptide and long peptide predictions, in particular, high scoring short peptides favour phenylalanine. This is consistent with the hypothesis that short and long peptides have different functional constraints, perhaps reflecting the difficulty for typical short peptides in supporting independent tertiary structure. We conclude that there are general shared features of bioactive peptides across different functional classes, indicating that computational prediction may accelerate the discovery of novel bioactive peptides and aid in the improved design of existing peptides, across many functional classes. An implementation of the predictive method, PeptideRanker, may be used to identify among a set of peptides those that may be more likely to be bioactive.","Protein tertiary structure,Predictive toxicology,Peptide sequence,Peptide mapping,Peptide,Computational biology,Biology,Bioinformatics,Antimicrobial peptides,Substitution matrix,Structural Classification of Proteins database,Smith–Waterman algorithm,Receiver operating characteristic,Pattern recognition,Medical decision making,UniProt,Relevant information,Protein family,Pleurocidin,Plectasin,Pharmacology,Peptide,Microbiology,Biology,Statistical analysis,Quadratic error,Prediction algorithms,Pharmaceutical industry,Outpatient clinic,Medicine,Sequence analysis,Peptide binding,Peptide,Structure–activity relationship,Sequence motif,Peptide,Side chain,Residue (complex analysis),Protein folding","Catherine Mooney,Niall J.

Rapamycin has two binding surfaces: one that binds to FKBP12 and the other to the Frb domain of mTor/FRAP, directing their dimerization. Rapamycin is a potent cell growth inhibitor, but chemical modification of the surface contacting Frb alleviates this effect. Productive interactions with Frb-fused proteins can be restored by mutation of Frb to accommodate the rapamycin analog (a rapalog). We have quantitatively assessed the interaction between rapalogs functionalized at C16 and C20 and a panel of Frb mutants. Several drug-Frb mutant combinations have different and nonoverlapping specificities. These Frb-rapalog partners permit the selective control of different Frb fusion proteins without crossreaction. The orthogonal control of multiple target proteins broadens the capabilities of chemical induction of dimerization to regulate biologic processes.","Small molecule,Protein Dimerization,PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway,Mutation,Mutant,Molecular biology,Fusion protein,FKBP,Biology,Biochemistry,Binding selectivity,mTORC2,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases,RPTOR,Immunophilins,FKBP,Cyclosporin a,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases,Signal transduction,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Phosphatase,Vesicle fusion,Transmembrane protein,Signal transduction,Serine,Protein structure,Protein kinase domain,Protein engineering,Pharmacology,Medicine,Ternary complex,Protein Dimerization,Mutant,Subcellular localization,Signal transduction,Protein structure,Transcriptional regulation,Transcription factor,Signal transduction","J.

In this article, we introduce a framework to allocate discharge permit by using Gini coefficient, a widely used index of income inequality in economics. The environmental Gini coefficient (EGC) method is based on a multi-criteria system, including land area, population, gross domestic product (GDP), and environmental capacity. The allocation of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the watershed at Tianjin, China is chosen as a case study to illustrate the application of this framework. The results show that the EGC method can provide a profound insight for environmental management with a focus on balance of environmental equality and efficiency for the policy-makers, especially in developing countries.","Watershed,Wastewater,Waste management,Population,Gross domestic product,Gini coefficient,Environmental engineering,Economics,Economic inequality,Developing country,Chemical oxygen demand,Sustainability,Population,Per capita,Yearbook,Library science,Economics,Normative,Natural resource economics,Finance,Secondary market,Price discovery,Microeconomics,Optimal tax,Microeconomics,Kyoto Protocol,Welfare state,Social security,Social Welfare,Population,Natural resource economics,Lorenz curve,Shared resource,Inequality,Income inequality metrics,Sustainable gardening,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Member states,Kyoto Protocol,International economics","Tao Sun,Hongwei Zhang,Yuan Wang,Xiangming Meng,Chenwan Wang,Gene Bazan,中華人民共和国国家統計局,Robert N.

The role of fuel mix, permit allocation and replacement investments",2013-01-01,Energy Economics,10.1016/J.ENECO.2012.09.019,"This paper assesses the carbon exposure of European electric utilities covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). First, we rely on an asset pricing model to empirically determine the effect of carbon price risks on firm-specific cost of capital for a sample of 20 European utility stocks during the period 2005–2010. Second, we employ a discounted cash flow framework to simulate carbon-adjusted equity values for three selected utilities and their investment strategies from 2009 to 2020. We show that company-specific carbon risks are asymmetrically distributed to a few utility firms: While for the great majority of power producers carbon price movements are not a relevant risk factor, we find that utilities with an extremely high-emitting fuel mix bear significant risk premiums for carbon which translate to higher cost of capital and a loss of equity value. In contrast, we find no evidence that low-emitting utilities benefit from reduced capital costs. We further reveal that, in addition to the firm's fuel mix, permit allocation rules and replacement investment decisions in terms of fuel technology choice are the driving forces behind the carbon exposure of the utilities. The carbon-related loss of equity value is substantially reduced by implementing an investment strategy directed towards a carbon-free generation mix. The derogations from full permit auctioning in Eastern European member states provide insurance against carbon risks of utilities.","Microeconomics,Investment strategy,Investment decisions,Equity value,Emissions trading,Economics,Eastern european,Discounted cash flow,Cost of capital,Carbon price,Stock valuation,Security market line,Price–sales ratio,Physical capital,Financial economics,Finance,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Resource management,Volatility risk premium,Return on equity,Liquidity premium,Windfall gain,Profitability index,Power sector,Volatility (finance),Stylized fact,Spot contract,Spot contract,Pilot phase,Overtime,Risk arbitrage,Investment theory,Index arbitrage,Rate of return,Project portfolio management,Profitability index,Ordinary least squares,Market model,Financial economics","Nicolas Koch,Alexander Bassen,Eugene F.

Methods and Results— Twenty patients with scar VT underwent ablation with a pLVAD. Neuromonitoring using cerebral oximetry was performed to evaluate a cerebral desaturation threshold to guide the duration of activation/entrainment mapping. The efficacy of pLVAD support was tested in a controlled manner with simulated VT. Complete procedural success was achieved in 50% (n=8) of patients, who were initially inducible for sustained VT, and partial procedural success in 37% (n=6). Using a cerebral desaturation level of 55% as a lower safety limit to guide the duration of sustained VT, 3 patients (15%) developed mild acute kidney injury (all resolved), and 1 (5%) patient developed mild cognitive dysfunction. During fast simulated VT (300 ms), cerebral desaturation to ≤55% occurred in more than half (53%) of patients tested without pLVAD support, compared with only 5% with full pLVAD support ( P =0.003). Conclusions— In a consecutive series of patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, pLVAD-supported scar VT ablation was safe and feasible. During fast simulated VT, a miniaturized axial flow pump imparted a more favorable hemodynamic profile compared with pharmacological agents alone. Cerebral oximetry is a complimentary monitoring modality during scar VT ablation, and avoidance of cerebral desaturations below a threshold of 55% may safely guide the duration of mapping during unstable VT.","Ventricular tachycardia ablation,Ventricular tachycardia,Percutaneous,Medicine,Internal medicine,Impella,Hemodynamics,Catheter ablation,Cardiology,Anesthesia,Acute kidney injury,Ablation,Urine output,Translational research,Renal angina,Task force,Sudden cardiac death,Medicine,Vt ablation,Ventricular tachycardia ablation,Medicine,Ventricular tachycardia,Substrate mapping,Sinus rhythm,Tissue oxygenation,Near-infrared spectroscopy,Monitoring oxygen,Surgery,Neurocognitive,Medicine,Troponin T,Surgery,Risk factor,Ventricular tachycardia,Surgery,Supraventricular tachycardia,Urine output,Stage (cooking),Rifle,Risk assessment,Physical therapy,Medicine","Marc A.

After selective attachment of 2-aminomethyl-18-crown-6 (18c6), individual AP lesions are detected during electrophoretic translocation through the bacterial protein ion channel α-hemolysin (α-HL) embedded in a lipid bilayer. Interactions between 18c6 and Na+ produce characteristic pulse-like current amplitude signatures that allow the identification of individual AP sites in single molecules of homopolymeric or heteropolymeric DNA sequences. The bulky 18c6-cation complexes also dramatically slow the DNA motion to more easily recordable levels. Further, the behaviors of the AP-18c6 adduct are different with respect to the directionalities of DNA entering the protein channel, and they can be precisely manipulated by altering the cation (Li+, Na+ or K+) of the electrolyte. This method permits detection of multiple AP lesions per strand, which is unprecedented in other work. Additionally, insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of 18c6-cation interactions at a single-molecule level are provided by the nanopore measurement.","Nanopore,Lipid bilayer,Ion channel,Processivity,Nucleic acid,Nanopore sequencing,Single molecule real time sequencing,Sequencing by ligation,Physics,RNA,Polynucleotide,Nanopore,Single molecule real time sequencing,Sequencing by ligation,Sequencing by hybridization,Single molecule real time sequencing,Sequencing by ligation,Nanopore sequencing,Transmembrane protein,Transmembrane domain,Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin,Protein secondary structure,Polynucleotide,Polymer,Protein engineering,Oligonucleotide,Nucleobase,RNA,Nucleic acid,Nanoscopic scale,RNA,Nucleotide,Nanopore","Na An,Aaron M.

1756,"The Urgent Need for Clinical Research Reform to Permit Faster, Less Expensive Access to New Therapies for Lethal Diseases",2015-01-01,Clinical Cancer Research,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-3246,"High costs of complying with drug development regulations slow progress and contribute to high drug prices and, hence, mounting health care costs. If it is exorbitantly expensive to bring new therapies to approval, fewer agents can be developed with available resources, impeding the emergence of urgently needed treatments and escalating prices by limiting competition. Excessive regulation produces numerous speed bumps on the road to drug authorization. Although an explosion of knowledge could fuel rapid advances, progress has been slowed worldwide by inefficient regulatory and clinical research systems that limit access to therapies that prolong life and relieve suffering. We must replace current compliance-centered regulation (appropriate for nonlethal diseases like acne) with “progress-centered regulation” in lethal diseases, where the overarching objective must be rapid, inexpensive development of effective new therapies. We need to (i) reduce expensive, time-consuming preclinical toxicology and pharmacology assessments, which add little value; (ii) revamp the clinical trial approval process to make it fast and efficient; (iii) permit immediate multiple-site trial activation when an eligible patient is identified (“just-in-time” activation); (iv) reduce the requirement for excessive, low-value documentation; (v) replace this excessive documentation with sensible postmarketing surveillance; (vi) develop pragmatic investigator accreditation; (vii) where it is to the benefit of the patient, permit investigators latitude in deviating from protocols, without requiring approved amendments; (viii) confirm the value of predictive biomarkers before requiring the high costs of IDE/CLIA compliance; and (ix) approve agents based on high phase I–II response rates in defined subpopulations, rather than mandating expensive, time-consuming phase III trials.

1779,Unified changes in cell size permit coordinated leaf evolution.,2013-01-01,New Phytologist,10.1111/NPH.12300,"Summary � The processes by which the functions of interdependent tissues are coordinated as lineages diversify are poorly understood. � Here, we examine evolutionary coordination of vascular, epidermal and cortical leaf tissues in the anatomically, ecologically and morphologically diverse woody plant family Proteaceae. � We found that, across the phylogenetic range of Proteaceae, the sizes of guard, epidermal, palisade and xylem cells were positively correlated with each other but negatively associated with vein and stomatal densities. The link between venation and stomata resulted in a highly efficient match between potential maximum water loss (determined by stomatal conductance) and the leaf vascular system’s capacity to replace that water. This important linkage is likely to be driven by stomatal size, because spatial limits in the packing of stomata onto the leaf surface apparently constrain the maximum size and density of stomata. � We conclude that unified evolutionary changes in cell sizes of independent tissues, possibly mediated by changes in genome size, provide a means of substantially modifying leaf function while maintaining important functional links between leaf tissues. Our data also imply the presence of alternative evolutionary strategies involving cellular miniaturization during radiation into closed forest, and cell size increase in open habitats.","Xylem,Woody plant,Stomatal conductance,Proteaceae,Plant Stomata,Phylogenetics,Phylogenetic tree,Genome size,Ecology,Botany,Biology,Programming language,Modular system,Biology,Xylem,Water transport,Tracheid,Water vapor,Transpiration,Plant Stomata,Taiga,Plant physiology,Photosynthesis,Zoology,Saurischia,Repeated sequence,Ploidy,Platanaceae,Paleopolyploidy,Vascular plant,Tropical rainforest,Transpiration,Plant morphology,Photosynthetic capacity,Photosynthesis,Ploidy,Phenotype,Herbaceous plant,Species richness,Southwest Australia,Southern Hemisphere","Tim J.

Using a GVHD protective nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen of total lymphoid irradiation and antithymocyte serum (TLI/ATS) in mice that has been recently adapted to clinical studies, we show that regulatory host NKT cells prevent the expansion and tissue inflammation induced by donor T cells, but allow retention of the killing activity of donor T cells against the BCL1 B cell lymphoma. Whereas wild-type hosts given transplants from wild-type donors were protected against progressive tumor growth and lethal GVHD, NKT cell-deficient CD1d−/− and Jα-18−/− host mice given wild-type transplants cleared the tumor cells but died of GVHD. In contrast, wild-type hosts given transplants from CD8−/− or perforin−/− donors had progressive tumor growth without GVHD. Injection of host-type NKT cells into Jα-18−/− host mice conditioned with TLI/ATS markedly reduced the early expansion and colon injury induced by donor T cells. In conclusion, after TLI/ATS host conditioning and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, host NKT cells can separate the proinflammatory and tumor cytolytic functions of donor T cells.","Proinflammatory cytokine,Natural killer T cell,Lymphoma,Leukemia,Immunology,Graft-versus-host disease,Cytolysis,Biology,B-cell lymphoma,Antitumor activity,Transplantation,Surgery,Stem cell,Transplantation Conditioning,Transplantation,Multiple myeloma,Transplantation,Progenitor cell,Myelodysplastic syndromes,Transplantation,Medicine,Major histocompatibility complex,Transplantation,Preparative Regimen,Pathology,Transplantation,Medicine,Interleukin 21,T lymphocyte,Natural killer cell,Natural killer T cell,Transplantation,Risk factor,Relative risk,T cell,Natural killer T cell,Interleukin 3,Transplantation,Surgery,Stem cell","Asha B.

The approach is based on self-assembled monolayers on gold that are patterned into regions presenting the Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cell adhesion ligand. The patterned regions differ in the electrochemical properties of the linkers that tether the peptides to the monolayer. In this work, three distinct chemistries are employed that provide for release of the ligand on application of a negative potential, release of the ligand on application of a positive potential, and no change in response to a potential. Cells were allowed to attach to a monolayer patterned into circular regions comprising the three chemistries. Treatment with electric potentials of 650 or -650 mV resulted in the selective release of adherent cells only from regions that display the relevant electroactive groups. This example establishes the preparation of dynamic substrates with multiple functions and will be important to preparing model cultures derived from multiple cell types, with control over the temporal interactions of each cell population.","Substrate (chemistry),Self-assembly,Self-assembled monolayer,Population,Nanotechnology,Monolayer,Ligand,Chemistry,Cell adhesion,Adhesion,Micropatterning,Cytoskeleton,Cellular differentiation,Surface modification,Surface engineering,Organic chemistry,Stimuli responsive,Smart surfaces,Nanotechnology,Voltammetry,Self-assembled monolayer,Redox,Tissue engineering,Surface engineering,Secretion,Substrate (chemistry),Self-healing hydrogels,Polyethylene glycol,Tissue engineering,Spheroid,Self-assembled monolayer,Thin film,Polymerization,Nanotechnology,Self-assembled monolayer,Nanotechnology,Molecular biology,Tissue engineering,Nanotechnology,Multicellular organism","Woon Seok Yeo,Milan Mrksich,Manuel Théry,Tim Desmet,Rino Morent,Nathalie De Geyter,Christophe Leys,Etienne Schacht,Paula M Mendes,Amanda L.

1797,Linkage of Tradable Permit Systems in International Climate Policy Architecture,2008-01-01,National Bureau of Economic Research,10.2139/SSRN.1285606,"Cap-and-trade systems have emerged as the preferred national and regional instrument for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases throughout the industrialized world, and the Clean Development Mechanism -- an international emission-reduction-credit system -- has developed a substantial constituency, despite some concerns about its performance. Because linkage between tradable permit systems can reduce compliance costs and improve market liquidity, there is great interest in linking cap-and-trade systems to each other, as well as to the CDM and other credit systems. We examine the benefits and concerns associated with various types of linkages, and analyze the near-term and long-term role that linkage may play in a future international climate policy architecture.

1804,Leptin Engages a Hypothalamic Neurocircuitry to Permit Survival in the Absence of Insulin,2013-01-01,Cell Metabolism,10.1016/J.CMET.2013.08.004,"The dogma that life without insulin is incompatible has recently been challenged by results showing the viability of insulin-deficient rodents undergoing leptin monotherapy. Yet, the mechanisms underlying these actions of leptin are unknown. Here, the metabolic outcomes of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of leptin in mice devoid of insulin and lacking or re-expressing leptin receptors (LEPRs) only in selected neuronal groups were assessed. Our results demonstrate that concomitant re-expression of LEPRs only in hypothalamic γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons is sufficient to fully mediate the lifesaving and antidiabetic actions of leptin in insulin deficiency. Our analyses indicate that enhanced glucose uptake by brown adipose tissue and soleus muscle, as well as improved hepatic metabolism, underlies these effects of leptin. Collectively, our data elucidate a hypothalamic-dependent pathway enabling life without insulin and hence pave the way for developing better treatments for diseases of insulin deficiency.","Soleus muscle,Leptin receptor,Leptin,Internal medicine,Insulin,Glucose uptake,Endocrinology,Drug metabolism,Diabetes mellitus,Brown adipose tissue,Biology,Software classification,Pathway enrichment,Gene set analysis,Tissue sections,Sagittal plane,Rat brain,miR-33,Sterol response element binding,Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2,Type 2 diabetes,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,Obesity,Statistics,Statistical inference,Point estimation,Pancreas,Molecular biology,Internal medicine,Lipodystrophy,Leptin receptor,Leptin Deficiency,Surgery,Metreleptin,Medicine,Transgenic Model,Pancreas,Internal medicine,Programmed cell death,Internal medicine,Heterologous","Teppei Fujikawa,Eric D Berglund,Vishal R Patel,Giorgio Ramadori,Claudia R Vianna,Linh Vong,Fabrizio Thorel,Simona Chera,Pedro Luis Herrera,Bradford B Lowell,Joel K Elmquist,Pierre Baldi,Roberto Coppari,Da Wei Huang,Brad T.

1816,A monopartite begomovirus-associated DNA beta satellite substitutes for the DNA B of a bipartite begomovirus to permit systemic infection.,2007-01-01,Journal of General Virology,10.1099/VIR.0.83049-0,"DNA β is a circular single-stranded satellite DNA which co-infects with certain monopartite helper begomoviruses to cause economically important diseases, such as cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD). DNA β encodes a single protein, βC1. Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) is a bipartite begomovirus in which both DNA A and DNA B are required for systemic infection. Inoculation of tomato plants with ToLCNDV DNA A alone induced local but not systemic infection, whereas co-inoculation with DNA A and the DNA β associated with CLCuD resulted in systemic infection. DNA β containing a disrupted βC1 open reading frame (ORF) did not mobilize DNA A systemically. Co-inoculation of plants with DNA A and a construct of the βC1 ORF, under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, resulted in the systemic movement of DNA A. In inoculated tobacco and onion epidermal cells, βC1 fused to GFP was localized at the cell periphery in association with punctate bodies, around and within the cell nucleus and with the endoplasmic reticulum. It is concluded that heterologous βC1 protein can replace the movement function of the DNA B of a bipartite begomovirus. Evidence is also provided that tomato leaf curl virus-encoded C4 protein confers the same movement function to ToLCNDV DNA A. The intracellular distribution of βC1 is consistent with the hypothesis that it has a role in transporting the DNA A from the nuclear site of replication to the plasmodesmatal exit sites of the infected cell.","Virology,Satellite DNA,Primer (molecular biology),Molecular biology,Leaf curl,Geminiviridae,DNA,Cauliflower mosaic virus,Biology,Begomovirus,Alphasatellite,Whitefly,Virology,Leaf curl,Viral evolution,Molecular evolution,Intercellular transport,Virology,Trans-acting siRNA,Small interfering RNA,Virology,Satellite DNA,Rolling circle replication,Virology,Nanoviruses,Host response,Whitefly,Virus,Satellite DNA,Virology,Tomato yellow leaf curl virus,Nicotiana benthamiana,Yellow fluorescent protein,Mitosis,Genetics,Virology,RNA,Protein–protein interaction,Virology,RNA silencing,RNA interference","Muhammad Saeed,Yusuf Zafar,John W.

Many programs are designed to accommodate community, cultural, and other nonefficiency goals through restrictions on trading. However, restrictions can decrease economic efficiency gains. We use a policy experiment from the Alaska halibut and sablefish tradable permit program, which includes both restricted and unrestricted permits, to develop one of the few empirical measurements of the costs of meeting nonefficiency goals.

1908,Dihydrofolate Reductase and Thymidylate Synthase Transgenes Resistant to Methotrexate Interact to Permit Novel Transgene Regulation,2015-01-01,Journal of Biological Chemistry,10.1074/JBC.C115.671123,"Abstract Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate which inhibits de novo purine and thymidine nucleotide synthesis. MTX induces death in rapidly replicating cells, and is used in the treatment of multiple cancers. MTX inhibits thymidine synthesis by targeting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS). The use of MTX to treat cancer also causes bone marrow suppression and inhibits the immune system. This has led to the development of a MTX−resistant DHFR − DHFR L22F, F31S (DHFR FS) to rescue healthy cells. 5−fluorouracil resistant TYMS T51S, G52S (TYMSSS) is resistant to MTX and improves MTX resistance of DHFRFS in primary T cells. Here we find that a known mechanism of MTX−induced increase in DHFR expression persists with DHFRFS and cis-expressed transgenes. We also find that TYMSSS expression of cis−expressed transgenes is similarly decreased in an MTX−inducible manner. MTX−inducible changes in DHFRFS and TYMSSS expression changes are lost when both genes are expressed together. In fact, expression of the DHFRFS and TYMSS cis−expressed transgenes becomes correlated. These findings provide the basis for an unrecognized post−transcriptional mechanism that functionally links expression of DHFR and TYMS. These findings were made in genetically−modified primary human T cells and have a clear potential for use in clinical applications where gene expression needs to be regulated by drug or maintained at a specific expression level. We demonstrate a potential application of this system in the controlled expression of systemically toxic cytokine interleukin − 12 (IL−12).","Thymidylate synthase,Thymidine,Molecular biology,Methotrexate,Jurkat cells,Genetic enhancement,Gene expression,Dihydrofolate reductase,Biology,Biochemistry,Antifolate,Unum,Self processing,Protein processing,Transgene,T cell,Suicide gene,Tumor microenvironment,T cell,Overproduction,Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes,Systemic administration,Secretion,Toxicity,Phases of clinical research,Medicine,Transplantation,Interleukin 2,Immunology,Thymidylate synthase,Pharmacology,Methotrexate,Thymidylate synthase,Proliferating cell nuclear antigen,Nuclear lamina,Thymidylate synthase,Purine metabolism,Polyglutamate,Translation (biology),Transfer RNA,Thymidylate synthase","David Rushworth,Amber Mathews,Amir Alpert,Laurence J.

In addition, the expression of even integrins αvβ6 and αvβ8 in tumor cell lines is not comprehensively documented. Here, we describe rabbit monoclonal antibodies (RabMabs) against the extracellular domains of αv integrins that react with both native integrins and formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) human tissues. These RabMabs, against αvβ3 (EM22703), αvβ5 (EM09902), αvβ6 (EM05201), αvβ8 (EM13309), and pan-αv (EM01309), recognize individual integrin chains in Western blots and in flow cytometry. EM22703 detected a ligand-induced binding site (LIBS), reporting an epitope enhanced by the binding of an RGD-peptide to αvβ3. αvβ8 was rarely expressed in human tumor specimens, and weakly expressed in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). However, ovarian carcinoma cell lines expressed αvβ8, as did some melanoma cells, whereas U87MG glioma lacked αvβ8 expression. We observed an unexpected strong expression of αvβ6 in tumor samples of invasive ductal breast adenoma, colorectal carcinoma (CRC), and NSCLC. αvβ3 was strongly expressed in some invasive NSCLC cohorts. Interestingly, PC3 prostate cell and human prostate tumors did not express αvβ3. The RabMabs stained plasma membranes in FFPE-immunohistochemistry (IHC) samples of tumor cell lines from lung, ovary, colon, prostate, squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN), breast, and pancreas carcinomas. The RabMabs are unique tools for probing αv integrin biology, and suggest that especially αvβ6 and αvβ8 biologies still have much to reveal.","Pathology,Ovarian carcinoma,Monoclonal antibody,Melanoma,Integrin,Immunohistochemistry,Flow cytometry,Epitope,Carcinoma,Biology,Integrin Signaling Pathway,Integrin,Focal adhesion assembly,Signal transduction,Metastasis,Integrin Inhibition,Stereochemistry,Signal transduction,Ligand (biochemistry),Signal transduction,Protein subunit,Protein structure,Signalling,Signal transduction,Receptor,Wound healing,Transforming growth factor beta,Receptor,Vitronectin,Receptor,Oligopeptide,Signalling pathways,Integrin,Immunology,microRNA,Tube formation,Small interfering RNA,Molecular biology,Integrin alpha M,Integrin","Simon L.

This article explores three crucial issues related to agroecological education and learning: (1) the phenomenological foundation for learning agroecology in higher education; (2) the process of students' interactions with a wide range of various learners within and outside the university environment; and (3) the unique characteristics of agroecology as a discipline and why these require different ways of learning than the conventional academic education. Phenomenology provides an epistemological foundation for learning about and interacting with the world outside the university.

We describe the agroecological and social characteristics of 61 food-producing gardens in New York City, drawing on gardener interviews, land-use maps, plant species inventories, arthropod scouting, and soil sampling and analysis. Gardens contained agricultural crops, food production infrastructure, ornamental plants, and recreational areas in varying proportions, indicating that gardens serve multiple and distinct purposes depending on community needs and interests. On average, gardeners devoted the greatest proportion of garden area (44 %) to food production, and supplied a large share of their households’ produce needs from their community gardens. Solanaceae, Brassicaceae, and Cucurbitaceae crops dominated food crop areas, hindering effective crop rotation to prevent disease and pest problems. Most gardeners grew crops in raised beds constructed with clean fill and compost. These soils generally had sandy textures, low water-holding capacity, high organic matter levels (with a large proportion from recent inputs) and excessive nutrient levels. Soil water content at field capacity increased exponentially with total soil carbon, suggesting that organic matter enhances water-holding capacity. Insect pest densities greatly exceeded action thresholds in nearly all gardens for aphids and whiteflies on Brassica crops, aphids on Cucurbit crops, and two-spotted spider mites on tomatoes. Predator and parasitoid densities were generally low (less than one per plant on average), perhaps partially due to low floral and woody perennial cover in most gardens (12 % and 9 % on average, respectively). Dominant groups of natural enemies were minute pirate bugs, spiders, and parasitoid wasps. A wide variety of people of differing experience levels, incomes, and ethnicities participate in community gardening in NYC, and most gardens host multiple languages. Promising directions for urban gardening research, education, and practice include: 1) Cover cropping to improve soil quality and nutrient management, and diversify crop rotations; 2) Improving access to soil testing and guidance on appropriate use of soil amendments, 3) Enhancing habitat for arthropod natural enemies that provide biological control of insect pests with floral and woody perennial plantings; and 4) Incorporating ecological knowledge and inquiry-based approaches into gardening workshops, educational materials, and technical support, and offering these resources in multiple languages.","Urban agriculture,Soil quality,Land use,Food security,Ecology,Crop rotation,Cover crop,Community gardening,Biology,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Research studies,Obesity,Medicine,Total human ecosystem,Sustainability,Spatial ecology,Particle-size distribution,Mineralogy,Materials science,Wildlife conservation,Resource management,Predation,Urban ecosystem,Urban ecology,Urban climate,Urban area,Public support,Introduced species,Population,Pest control,PEST analysis,Urban community,Social psychology,Respondent,Social determinants of health,Mental health,Medicine,Sorghum,Soil organic matter,Nutrient cycle","Megan M.

HFmrEF patient characteristics and prognosis are poorly defined. The aim of this study was to analyze the HFmrEF category in a cohort of hospitalized heart failure patients (REDINSCOR II Registry). Methods A prospective observational study was conducted with 1420 patients classified according to ejection fraction as follows: HFrEF, Results Among the study participants, 583 (41%) had HFrEF, 227 (16%) HFmrEF, and 610 (43%) HFpEF. HFmrEF patients had a clinical profile similar to that of HFpEF patients in terms of age, blood pressure, and atrial fibrillation prevalence, but shared with HFrEF patients a higher proportion of male participants and ischemic etiology, and use of class I drugs targeting HFrEF. All other features were intermediate, and comorbidities were similar among the 3 groups. There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality, cause of death, or heart failure readmission. The similar outcomes were confirmed in the propensity score matched cohorts.

1940,Twin-arginine translocase mutations that suppress folding quality control and permit export of misfolded substrate proteins,2012-01-01,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/PNAS.1210140109,"The bacterial twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway facilitates the transport of correctly folded proteins across the tightly sealed cytoplasmic membrane. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of suppressor mutations in the Tat translocase that allow export of misfolded proteins, which form structures that are not normally tolerated by the wild-type translocase. Selection of suppressors was enabled by a genetic assay that effectively linked in vivo folding and stability of a test protein with Tat export efficiency of a selectable marker protein, namely TEM-1 β-lactamase. By using a test protein named α3B—a designed three-helix-bundle protein that forms collapsed, stable molten globules but lacks a uniquely folded structure—translocase mutants that rescued export of this protein were readily identified. Each mutant translocase still efficiently exported folded substrate proteins, indicating that the substrate specificity of suppressors was relaxed but not strictly altered. A subset of the suppressors could also export other misfolded proteins, such as the aggregation-prone α3A protein and reduced alkaline phosphatase.

However, it faces two dilemmas, recently highlighted by complexity theory: the problems of boundary and change. We propose that interpreting Koestler’s holon as an intentional entity embedded in an ecology of contexts provides an ontological construct which addresses both of these issues. The holon is in some ways a whole and in other ways a part, and to see it simultaneously as both we suggest an epistemological tool that we term flickering. In our interpretation a holon is bounded by its intentionality to persist, and the imperative to do so in multiple, incommensurable, and ever-evolving contexts motivates – indeed, makes both possible and inevitable – change. Farms are compelling examples of holons, as their humans plan and act to maintain them as a source of livelihood, necessarily in contexts as diverse and shifting as climate, life histories, trade rules, subsidies, personal spirituality and public perceptions of agricultural practices.","Systems thinking,Subsidy,Spirituality,Ontology,Livelihood,Intentionality,Epistemology,Environmental resource management,Economics,Ecology of contexts,Ecology,Commensurability (philosophy of science),Right to development,Politics,Law and economics,Temporality,Sociology,Social science,Quality of life,Labour economics,Economics,Sociology,Relational dialectics,Prehistory,Sociology,Social value orientations,Social science,Systems thinking,Social science,Psychology,Sociology,Social science,Phenomenology (philosophy),Quark,Physics,Particle physics,Sustainability,Social exclusion,Poverty,Narrative structure,Narrative psychology,Narrative inquiry","William L.

Organic farming might contribute to this through decreased use of farm inputs and increased soil carbon sequestration, but it might also exacerbate emissions through greater food production elsewhere to make up for lower organic yields. To date there has been no rigorous assessment of this potential at national scales. Here we assess the consequences for net GHG emissions of a 100% shift to organic food production in England and Wales using life-cycle assessment. We predict major shortfalls in production of most agricultural products against a conventional baseline. Direct GHG emissions are reduced with organic farming, but when increased overseas land use to compensate for shortfalls in domestic supply are factored in, net emissions are greater. Enhanced soil carbon sequestration could offset only a small part of the higher overseas emissions.","Soil carbon sequestration,Organic farming,Land use,Greenhouse gas,Genetics,Food processing,Environmental protection,Environmental impact assessment,Biology,Agroecology,Agriculture,Soil science,Population,Organic farming,Wildlife conservation,Land management,Habitat,Soil water,Soil carbon,Greenhouse gas,Terrestrial ecosystem,Land use,Land management,Sustainability,Manure,Livestock,Yield gap,Phosphorus,Organic farming,Welfare,Trophic level,Population growth,Tillage,Soil science,Soil carbon,Nutrient pollution,Nitrogen,Manure,Tropics,Topsoil,Temperate climate","Laurence G Smith,Guy J D Kirk,Philip J Jones,Adrian G Williams,Verena Seufert,Navin Ramankutty,Jonathan A.

2019,Prioritizing climate-smart agricultural land use options at a regional scale,2017-01-01,Agricultural Systems,10.1016/J.AGSY.2016.09.018,"The promotion of climate-smart agriculture in different parts of the world requires a clear understanding of its relative suitability, costs and benefits, and the environmental implications of various technological interventions in a local context under current and future climates. Such data are generally difficult to obtain from the literature, field surveys and focused group discussions, or from biophysical experiments. This article describes a spreadsheet-based methodology that generates this information based on a region specific production function and ‘target yield’ approach in current and future climate scenarios. Target yields are identified for homogeneous agroecological spatial units using published crop yield datasets, crop models, expert judgement, biophysical land characterisations, assessment of yield gaps and future development strategies. Validated production/transfer functions are used to establish relationships between inputs (water, seed, fertilizer, machinery, energy, labour, costs) and outputs (crop yields, residues, water and fertiliser use efficiencies, greenhouse gas emissions, financial returns). The process is repeated for all spatial units of the region, identified through detailed mapping of critical biophysical factors, and for all suitable current and potential agronomic production technologies and practices. The application of this approach is illustrated for prioritizing agronomic interventions that can enhance productivity and incomes, help farmers adapt to current risk, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions in current and future climates for the flood- and drought-prone state of Bihar in north-eastern India. In general, climate smartness increases with advanced technologies. Yield is the least limiting while emission is the most limiting factor across the entire crop-technology portfolio for climate smartness. Finally, we present a robust climate smart land use plan at district level in Bihar under current and future climate scenarios.","Land-use planning,Land use,Greenhouse gas,Food security,Environmental resource management,Economics,Climate change,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural land,Lysimeter,Irrigation management,Evapotranspiration,Weather station,Spatial variability,Spatial ecology,Tropics,Representative Concentration Pathways,Food security,Natural resource,Environmental resource management,Environmental degradation,Sustainable Agriculture Innovation Network,Good agricultural practice,Food systems,Sustainable development,Sustainability,Poverty,Soil carbon,Land use, land-use change and forestry,Knowledge transfer,Soil water,Soil fertility,Soil carbon,Test data generation,Suite,Meteorology,Policy analysis,Mixed farming,Milk quota","Paresh B.

2022,Improving nitrogen management via a regional management plan for Chinese rice production,2015-01-01,Environmental Research Letters,10.1088/1748-9326/10/9/095011,"A lack of basic information on optimal nitrogen (N) management often results in over- or under-application of N fertilizer in small-scale intensive rice farming. Here, we present a new database of N input from a survey of 6611 small-scale rice farmers and rice yield in response to added N in 1177 experimental on-farm tests across eight agroecological subregions of China. This database enables us to evaluate N management by farmers and develop an optimal approach to regional N management. We also investigated grain yield, N application rate, and estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in comparison to N application and farming practices. Across all farmers, the average N application rate, weighted by the area of rice production in each subregion, was 210 kg ha−1 and ranged from 30 to 744 kg ha−1 across fields and from 131 to 316 kg ha−1 across regions. The regionally optimal N rate (RONR) determined from the experiments averaged 167 kg ha−1 and varied from 114 to 224 kg N ha−1 for the different regions. If these RONR were widely adopted in China, approximately 56% of farms would reduce their use of N fertilizer, and approximately 33% would increase their use of N fertilizer. As a result, grain yield would increase by 7.4% from 7.14 to 7.67 Mg ha−1, and the estimated GHG emissions would be reduced by 11.1% from 1390 to 1236 kg carbon dioxide (CO2) eq Mg−1 grain. These results suggest that to achieve the goals of improvement in regional yield and sustainable environmental development, regional N use should be optimized among N-poor and N-rich farms and regions in China.","Rice farming,Rice farmers,Nitrogen management,N application,Greenhouse gas,Environmental Development,Economics,Agronomy,Agroecology,Agriculture,Regional science,Political science,Physical science,Sustainability,No-till farming,Intensive farming,Tillage,Soil organic matter,Population,Vegetation type,Vegetation,Soil water,Natural ecosystem,Genetics,Food security,Tonne,Population,Nitrogen fertilizer,Soil carbon,Population,Life-cycle assessment,Tillage,Soil water,Nitrous oxide,Nitrous oxide,Human health,Greenhouse gas,Nitrogen,N management,Grain yield","Liang Wu,Xinping Chen,Zhenling Cui,Guiliang Wang,S. edited Solomon,Cameron M.

2023,Climate variability and yields of major staple food crops in Northern Ghana,2012-01-01,African Crop Science Journal,10.4314/ACSJ.V20I2,"Climate variability, the short-term fluctuations in average weather conditions and agriculture affect each other. Climate variability affects the agroecological and growing conditions of crops and livestock, and is recently believed to be the greatest impediment to the realisation of the first Millennium Development Goal of reducing poverty and food insecurity in arid and semi-arid regions of developing countries. Conversely, agriculture is a major contributor to climate variability and change by emitting greenhouse gases and reducing the agroecology’s potential for carbon sequestration. What however, is the empirical evidence of this inter-dependence of climate variability and agriculture in Sub-Sahara Africa? In this paper, we provide some insight into the long run relationship between inter-annual variations in temperature and rainfall, and annual yields of the most important staple food crops in Northern Ghana. Applying pooled panel data of rainfall, temperature and yields of the selected crops from 1976 to 2010 to cointegration and Granger causality models, there is cogent evidence of cointegration between seasonal, total rainfall and crop yields; and causality from rainfall to crop yields in the Sudano-Guinea Savannah and Guinea Savannah zones of Northern Ghana. This suggests that inter-annual yields of the crops have been influenced by the total amounts of rainfall in the planting season. Temperature variability over the study period is however stationary, and is suspected to have minimal effect, if any, on crop yields. Overall, the results confirm the appropriateness of our attempt in modelling long-term relationships between the climate and crop yield variables.","Staple food,Growing season,Greenhouse gas,Crop yield,Climate change,Biology,Arid,Agronomy,Agroforestry,Agroecology,Agriculture,Statistics,Score test,Restricted maximum likelihood,Yield gap,Irrigation,Growing season,Transfer entropy,Statistics,Slowness,Water resources,Water flow,Temperate climate,Wet season,West african,West africa,Sowing,Small-scale agriculture,Precipitation,Wet season,Water resources,Surface runoff","J Amikuzino,SA Donkoh,Soren Johansen,David B.

In particular it engages with the debate between Henry Bernstein and Philip McMichael and analyzes their different conceptualizations of agrarian capitalism. It critically identifies tendencies in food sovereignty approaches to assume a food regime crisis, to one-sidedly emphasize accumulation by dispossession and enclosure and thereby to overlook the importance of expanded reproduction, and to espouse a romantic optimism about farmer-driven agroecological knowledge which is devoid of modern science. Alternatives to current modernization trajectories cannot simply return to the peasant past and to the local. Instead, they need to recognize the desires of farmers to be incorporated into larger commodity networks, the importance of industrialization and complex chains for feeding the world population, and the support of state and science, as well as social movements, for realizing a food sovereign alternative.","Sovereignty,Sociology,Social movement,Political economy,Peasant,Modernization theory,Food sovereignty,Economy,Development economics,Capitalism,Agrarian society,Accumulation by dispossession,Uneven and combined development,Spanish Civil War,Sociology,Population,Organic farming,Food systems,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant,Yield gap,Phosphorus,Organic farming,Sociology,Social equality,Political economy,International trade,Human rights,Food sovereignty,Sociology,Social issues,Political economy,Sociology,Skepticism,Population,Narrative,Latin Americans,Land grabbing,Subsidy,Modernity,Market economy","Kees Jansen,David Harvey,Catherine Badgley,Jeremy Moghtader,Eileen Quintero,Emily Zakem,M.

Utilising Ajzen's theory of planned behaviour as a framework for analysis, reducing inputs was found to be primarily a response to financial pressures, also reflected in changing substantive norms towards balancing risks and potential returns against investment, rather than optimising production. However, despite the apparent ease of converting to organic farming from low input practice, formal conversion to organic farming was not found to be the automatic outcome of this trajectory: instead, organic farming was identified as only one of a number of options for increasing the financial viability of the farming operation, which included other niche markets, pluriactivity and contracting land to and from other farmers. The affiliation of low input farmers with organic production denotes positive attitudes towards both organic farming and environmental practices, but a lack of understanding about organic farming techniques. The author argues that due to declining returns/input ratios, future conversion to organic farming may reflect the value placed on other aspects of organic production, such as increased labour, risk reduction and environmental ideals, and highlights the environmental implications of the ongoing ‘cost price squeeze’ on farming households.","Organic farming,Mixed farming,Integrated farming,Extensive farming,Environmental resource management,Economics,Ecological farming,Diversification (marketing strategy),Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural economics,Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology,Theory of reasoned action,Theory of planned behavior,Theory of planned behavior,Psychology,Management science,Sustainability,Organic farming,Mixed farming,Sustainable transport,Subsidy,Per capita,Sociology,Rural sociology,Organic farming,Sociology,Social science,Rural society,The Symbolic,Symbolic capital,Social science,The Symbolic,Symbolic interactionism,Sustainable development,Sustainable agriculture,Sustainability,Organic farming,Organic farming,Land use,Environmental change","Lee-Ann Sutherland,Icek Ajzen,Mark Conner,Brian Mcmillan,D.G.

Despite their growing popularity among young farmers with no agricultural background, there are no data on expected income generated by these small-scale farms. Our objective was to determine the economic viability generated by a given agricultural area based on distinct microfarm scenarios. We used the stochastic model MERLIN to simulate 18microfarm scenarios combining three technical systems (varying with respect to the mechanization level, use of commercial inputs, cropping density, and number of cropping cycles per year), two marketing strategies (varying with respect to the length of the selling period and the range of crops grown), and three investment hypotheses (varying with respect to the level of bank loans and the percentage of workload used for self-built equipment).

Malting barley production is of high economic significance because malt is a scarce product in the world market, if it conforms with the quality parameters set by the Brewing Industry Association. In order to determine the most favorable varieties for malt production in the agroecological conditions of Serbia, a number of spring and winter barley varieties bred at the Small Grains Research Center in Kragujevac were used in the trial. Comparative variety examinations were carried out in a two-year period at five different sites. Based upon grain yield values obtained it can be concluded that all varieties produced a satisfactory result, with the Jagodinac and Record, two-rowed winter barley varieties, having achieved the highest yield. The Jagodinac variety is a malting barley type and of excellent technological quality, and the Record variety can be used for malt production or livestock nutrition.

The following sections address two expressions of small-scale agricultural production: contract farming and agroecological short-circuit food provisioning. These two varieties of contemporary peasantries express different forms of dependent autonomy and are integrated in value accumulation circuits in different ways. A final section of the article attempts to compare aspects present in agriculture with similar ones present in other sectors of production to show the theoretical value of these discussions.","Peasant,Fair trade,Economy,Economics,Contract farming,Agroecology,Agriculture,Agricultural productivity,Agrarian society,Agrarian reform,World War II,Wealth concentration,Twenty-First Century,Globalization,Geopolitics,Genealogy,Social science,Short food supply chains,Rural development,Poverty,Political economy,Land grabbing,Sustainability,Politics,Peasant,Social change,Poor people,Natural resource economics,Sociology,Social science,Rural sociology,Specialty coffee,Organic coffee,Livelihood,Latin Americans,Land grabbing,Globalization,Sociology,Social protection,Rural population","Susana Narotzky,Thomas Piketty,Philip McMichael,Henk Renting,Terry K Marsden,Jo Banks,Tania Murray Li,Miguel A.
