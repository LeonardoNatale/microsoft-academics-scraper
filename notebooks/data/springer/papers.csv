0,The effects of emission trading system on corporate innovation and productivity-empirical evidence from China’s SO_2 emission trading system,"Emission trading system is a significant market-based environmental regulation tool worldwide. This study fills existing knowledge gap on whether ETSs have “weak” and “strong” version of Porter hypothesis effects in China, by examining the effects of the Chinese SO_2 emission trading on corporate innovation and productivity. Using the micro-data of domestic-listed manufacturing companies from 2004 to 2015, this study regarded China’s SO_2 emission trading system as a quasi-natural experiment by applying a difference-in-difference framework to eliminate endogenous problems. It was found that the SO_2 emission trading system significantly promoted corporate innovation but did not have a significant effect on corporate productivity. The cause analysis showed that suboptimal institutional context and lack of corporate dynamic response led to the failure of strong Porter hypothesis effect. In addition, small- and medium-sized enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises gained greater innovation compensation effects of the emission trading system. This research believed that, the design, institutional context, and market incentives of emission trading systems need to be improved from the top down, to achieve the dual goal of environmental sustainability and economic growth.",2020-06-01,10.1007/s11356-020-08566-x,"['Tang, Hong-li', 'Liu, Jian-min', 'Mao, Jun', 'Wu, Jin-guang']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-08566-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
1,Transboundary pollution control and environmental absorption efficiency management,"In this paper, we suggest a two-player differential game model of transboundary pollution that accounts for time-dependent environmental absorption efficiency, which allows the biosphere to switch from a carbon sink to a source. We investigate the impact of negative externalities resulting from a transboundary pollution non-cooperative game wherein countries are dynamically involved. Based on a linear-quadratic specification for the instantaneous revenue function, we assess differences related to both transient path and steady state between cooperative solution, open-loop and Markov perfect Nash equilibria (MPNE). Regarding the methodological contribution of the paper, we suggest a particular structure of the conjectured value function to solve MPNE problems with multiplicative interaction between state variables in one state equation, so that third-order terms that arise in the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation are made negligible. Using a collocation procedure, we confirm the validity of the particular structure of the conjectured value function. The results suggest unexpected contrasts in terms of pollution control and environmental absorption efficiency management: (i) in the long run, an open-loop Nash equilibrium (OLNE) allows equivalent emissions to the social optimum but requires greater restoration efforts; (ii) although an MPNE is likely to end up with lower emissions and greater restoration efforts than an OLNE, it has a much greater chance of falling in the emergency area; (iii) the absence of cooperation and or precommitment becomes more costly as the initial absorption efficiency decreases; (iv) more heavily discounted MPNE strategies are less robust than OLNE to prevent irreversible switching of the biosphere from a carbon sink to a source.",2020-04-01,10.1007/s10479-018-2927-7,"['El Ouardighi, Fouad', 'Kogan, Konstantin', 'Gnecco, Giorgio', 'Sanguineti, Marcello']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-018-2927-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
2,"Research on the sustainable development process of low-carbon pilot cities: the case study of Guiyang, a low-carbon pilot city in south-west China","China plans to pursue low-carbon development in its low-carbon pilot cities to control greenhouse gas emissions. The low-carbon city development is an important method to achieve sustainable development strategy, while it is also a new city development mode to promote natural ecology, low-carbon economy and social happiness. However, the evaluation process of the low-carbon city is a multiple objective and decision problem. A single indicator cannot comprehensively and objectively evaluate a city’s low-carbon development level, so a comprehensive evaluation index system should be established. So taking Guiyang as a case study, this article constructs 35 evaluating indicators that are based on the basic urban development level and low-carbon urban development level to analyse the economic development, social progress and environmental quality transmutation comprehensively by using the entropy method. The results show that in the whole process of sustainable development, the economic development, social progress and the environmental quality have been greatly improved, but the low-carbon level had been on the low side from 2003 to 2016 in Guiyang. Therefore, Guiyang still has a long way to go to become a low-carbon city, and concrete policies and countermeasures should be taken to promote the low-carbon level. In particular, Guiyang has to strengthen the dual constraint of carbon emission intensity and total carbon emissions, adhere to the development path characterized by low carbon and strive to achieve leapfrog development.",2020-03-14,10.1007/s10668-020-00679-0,"['Peng, Tao', 'Deng, Hongwei']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-020-00679-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
3,A new emission trading with bounded rational countries: a network game approach,"This paper designs a new carbon trading mechanism, that is, developed countries will give developing countries a certain amount of subsidies and require them to undertake a certain amount of additional emission reduction tasks in order to promote emission reduction of developing countries. This is equivalent to developed countries “buying emission permits” from developing countries. We study the dynamic property of this kind of emission trading and treat the trading process as a social network that exhibits network effects in which there exist only one developed country and many developing countries. Furthermore, we model the developing countries as bounded rational, i.e., they are unable to pay immediate attention to price changes. Finally, we find that the developed country’s optimal prices trajectory has the following structure: the price is low when the number of bounded countries is less than a certain level and is high when the number is greater than the target. We also show that a certain number of bounded rational developing countries are conducive to the success of emission trading.",2020-02-28,10.1007/s42452-020-2264-8,"['Chen, Weidong', 'Li, Liming']",SN Applied Sciences,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42452-020-2264-8.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
4,"Emission Reporting, Registration and Permit System","There are two key parts of the Emission Reporting, Registration and Permit System (“the Emission Permit System” in short), namely, emission reporting and registration, and emission permit, respectively. First, the polluter shall report to and register with the competent authority for environmental protection for its pollution conditions, including pollutant(s) emission facilities, pollutant(s) treatment facilities, and the types, quantities and emission concentrations of pollutants under normal operating conditions, as per the relevant regulations. Second, according to the application of the polluter, the competent authority for environmental protection shall issue an emission permit to the polluter specifying the allowable emission terms for the polluter under normal operating and production conditions. As clearly defined in Sect.  6.2.1 , whichever entity directly discharges pollutants (including air pollutants, water pollutants, noise, and solid wastes) into the environment is a polluter; they can be categorized as key pollutants polluters and general pollutants polluters.

8,Energy Governance in Spain,"Spain is lagging behind in the transition to a sustainable energy system compared to other EU member states. Its unique position as an energy island, coupled with errors in energy planning inherited from previous government regimes, constitute a legacy that makes changes in the system difficult to achieve. Current political instability adds to the difficulties, under a governance framework characterised by lack of coordination and supremacy of the central government in the decision making process, in an environment where traditional energy companies still exert lobby power. The continuous changes in the regulatory framework of the energy sector have hindered investments in low carbon sources of energy due to perceived uncertainty. Small changes in the right direction are being observed though, with a more prominent role expected from the local levels of government. But many measures still originate on requirements linked to EU commitments and more initiatives at the national level need to be seen.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-73526-9_29-1,"['Campos-Martín, Jose M.', 'Crespo, Laura', 'Fernandez, Rosa M.']",Handbook of Energy Governance in Europe,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-73526-9_29-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
9,The efforts of Taiwan to achieve NDC target: an integrated assessment on the carbon emission trading system,"In this paper, we adopt a computable general equilibrium model to investigate the impacts of achieving Taiwan’s target of nationally determined contributions (NDC). We consider two types of scenarios: one implemented with the emission trading system (ETS) and the other designed under cap without trade. Our findings suggest that Taiwan’s NDC target is achievable in two policies but with different economic costs. On the one hand, ETS reconciles the demand and supply for emission allowances. More participants in the ETS increase the chance that a buyer can match the seller; moreover, the carbon price is lower. On the other hand, in the cap-without-trade scenario, industrial sectors have to pay higher prices for emission allowances if there is no market for emission–allowance exchanges. Furthermore, we find that the initial distribution of free emission allowances affects not only sectoral emissions but also GDP loss. In 2030, the GDP loss ranges from 1.8 to 2.2% in the cap-without-trade scenario and around 1.8% in the ETS. Therefore, the ETS helps achieve Taiwan’s NDC target with a lower economic loss. Taiwan, an independent energy system isolated from other countries or regions, can achieve its NDC target with the launch of ETS.",2019-12-01,10.1007/s11069-019-03660-x,"['Wu, Yi-Hua', 'Dai, Hancheng', 'Xie, Yang', 'Masui, Toshihiko']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-019-03660-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

11,On the Strategic Effect of International Permits Trading on Local Pollution,"We introduce a model of strategic environmental policy where two firms compete à la Cournot in a third market in the presence of multiple pollutants. Two types of pollutants are introduced: a local and a transboundary one. The regulator can only control local pollution as transboundary pollution is regulated internationally. We illustrate that when transboundary pollution is regulated through the use of tradable emission permits instead of non-tradable ones then a new strategic effect appears which has not been identified thus far. In this case, local pollution increases further. We caution that linking permit markets across regions may be welfare detrimental. We also provide evidence from the implementation of EU ETS over the pollution of particulate matters ( $$PM_{10}$$ P M 10 and $$PM_{2.5})$$ P M 2.5 ) .",2019-11-01,10.1007/s10640-019-00369-0,"['Antoniou, Fabio', 'Kyriakopoulou, Efthymia']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-019-00369-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
12,Building Climate Coalitions on Preferential Free Trade Agreements,"In this paper we discuss the endogenous formation of climate coalitions in an issue-linkage regime. In particular, we propose a preferential free trade agreement on which a climate coalition should be built. The basic idea is that the gains of free trade can provide strong incentives for countries to join the coalition. As a framework, a multi-stage strategic trade model is employed in which each country may set an emission cap being effective on a permit market. In addition, a discriminatory import tariff may be imposed on dirty goods. However, at the heart of our approach is a preferential free trade arrangement among the members of a climate coalition leading to a favourable shift in the terms of trade. As a main result, trade liberalisation is found as an institution highly effective in building climate coalitions. In particular, the parametrical simulation of the model shows that participation in joint emission reduction is higher, consumption patterns are more environmentally friendly, and coalitional welfare is much more improved than in case of a single-issue environmental agreement.",2019-10-01,10.1007/s10640-019-00331-0,"['Kuhn, Thomas', 'Pestow, Radomir', 'Zenker, Anja']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-019-00331-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
13,Optimal Abatement Technology Licensing in a Dynamic Transboundary Pollution Game: Fixed Fee Versus Royalty,"Transboundary pollution poses a major threat to environment and human health. An effective approach to addressing this problem is the adoption of long-term abatement technology; however, many developing regions are lacking in related technologies that can be acquired by licensing from developed regions. This study focuses on a differential game model of transboundary pollution between two asymmetric regions, one of which possesses advanced abatement technology that can reduce the abatement cost and licenses this technology to the other region by royalty or fixed-fee licensing. We characterize the equilibrium decisions in the regions and find that fixed-fee licensing is superior to royalty licensing from the viewpoint of both regions. The reason is that under fixed-fee licensing, the regions can gain improved incremental revenues and incur reduced environmental damage. Subsequently, we analyze the steady-state equilibrium behaviors and the effects of parameters on the licensing performance. The analysis indicates that the myopic view of the regions leads to short-term revenue maximization, resulting in an increase in total pollution stock. Moreover, a high level of abatement technology or emission tax prompts the licensee region to choose fixed-fee approach, which is beneficial both economically and environmentally for two regions.",2019-07-23,10.1007/s10614-019-09909-8,"['Xu, Hao', 'Tan, Deqing']",Computational Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10614-019-09909-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
14,Double Free-Riding in Innovation and Abatement: A Rules Treaty Solution,"In addressing climate change, both abatement itself and the innovation of superior abatement technologies are exposed to free-riding. To examine this double free-riding problem, we develop a multi-country model with an international market for emission permits and licenses for abatement technologies. We show that the two problems are mutually reinforcing. To address the double free-riding problem we propose a rules treaty for innovation and abatement that consists of two rules, an allocation rule and a refunding rule. The allocation rule determines the share of issued emission permits that each country can directly allocate to its domestic firms, while the remainder is handed over to an international agency. The refunding rule determines how the agency’s revenues from selling these permits to firms are redistributed. A fraction is given to those countries that successfully develop superior abatement technologies provided they license the technology free of charge to all countries. The remaining revenues are redistributed to all countries. These rules can approximate globally optimal abatement and innovation levels.",2019-06-01,10.1007/s10640-018-0270-8,"['Gersbach, Hans', 'Oberpriller, Quirin', 'Scheffel, Martin']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-018-0270-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
15,"Which performs better under trader settings, double auction or uniform price auction?","A marketable permit system (MPS) has been suggested as a solution to environmental problems. Although the properties of MPSs under non-trader settings, in which each player is exclusively either a seller or a buyer, are well documented, little research has explored how MPSs perform under trader settings, in which each player can be both a seller and a buyer. We institute two auctions of trader settings in MPS experiments: a double auction (DA) and a uniform price auction (UPA). We then evaluate and compare their performances both with each other and with those under non-trader settings. The main results are as follows: DAs under trader settings perform much worse than do DAs under non-trader settings, whereas UPAs perform well, regardless of the trader and non-trader settings. UPAs are more efficient and generate more stable prices than do DAs under trader settings, and a considerable proportion of trades in DAs under trader settings consist of “flips” that could be considered speculation or errors. Thus, UPAs are likely to work better than DAs under trader settings.",2019-03-15,10.1007/s10683-018-9585-0,"['Kotani, Koji', 'Tanaka, Kenta', 'Managi, Shunsuke']",Experimental Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10683-018-9585-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
16,The Limit of Global Carbon Tax and its Climatic and Economic Effects,"Global carbon tax has been widely studied for a long time. However, its economic feasibility in specific countries and sectors has not been taken seriously. This study focuses on the limit of carbon tax in carbon reduction and its economic and climatic impacts. To accurately predict the economic impact of carbon tax for assessing its feasibility, a climatic-economic IAM named CIECIA is applied and improved by adding a carbon tax module. In this model, two levy types of carbon tax with an adjustable revenue distribution mode are designed. On the basis of this, the emission reduction limits of carbon tax and its economic and climatic effects are simulated. The results indicate that carbon tax reduces emissions in two ways: directly, by reducing the output of high-emission sectors, and indirectly, by promoting the adoption of low-carbon technologies. Global carbon tax can achieve the $$2\,{^{\circ }}\hbox {C}$$ 2 ∘ C climate mitigation target under a national independent mode, whereas under a global uniform mode, the limit of temperature control is around $$2.46\,{^{\circ }}\hbox {C}$$ 2.46 ∘ C . As the cost of carbon reduction, the economic loss is also significant, especially in developing countries. Investing R&D by using carbon tax revenue is an effective way to both reduce emissions further and ease economic loss. On the basis of this, we propose a Pareto improving scheme that both ensures the economic benefits of all participating countries and achieves climate mitigation targets.",2019-01-31,10.1007/s10614-017-9735-z,"['Gu, Gaoxiang', 'Wang, Zheng']",Computational Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10614-017-9735-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
17,Methods of Environmental Risk Management for Land Contamination Problems: Suggestions for Japan,"In Japan, the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act was enacted in 2002. Since then, implementation of the required countermeasures to tackle land contamination in urban areas has improved considerably. However, the pollution of soil on private land may spread undetected. Moreover, contaminated land may be left untreated because ridding soil of contamination is very expensive. Therefore, further countermeasures to reduce the environmental risk of land contamination in urban areas are necessary. This study’s purpose is to suggest methods of environmental risk management for urban land contamination in Japan. First, we consider sources of contamination, differentiating point sources and nonpoint sources, to evaluate how best to manage the environmental risk of land contamination. The characteristics of these two source types are explained through the concept of transaction costs. Second, we discuss how Japan has approached land contamination problems and adopted regulations since the period of high economic growth. We also briefly discuss foreign countries’ regulations. We then examine what kinds of typical environmental policy measures are effective in environmental risk management for land contamination. Finally, we suggest practical methods of environmental risk management for land contamination in urban areas. This requires efficient methods to reduce contamination with low transaction costs. In particular, the costs of monitoring and enforcing to reduce contamination caused by nonpoint sources are high. Therefore, it is important to manage these sources appropriately.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-981-13-7619-1_9,"['Ebisu, Miwa', 'Hagihara, Kiyoko']",Building Resilient Regions,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-13-7619-1_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

25,Review of comparative studies on market mechanisms for carbon emission reduction: a bibliometric analysis,"This study uses the bibliometric method to analyze the comparative studies on different market mechanisms applied to carbon reduction between 1970 and 2016 based on the online databases of Science Citation Index Expanded (1970–2016) and Social Science Citation Index (2002–2016). We found by observing the characteristics of publications that such studies belong to a multidisciplinary field that has been continuously developing since the 1990s. The USA and the UK have maintained their leading research strengths in the field, whereas China entered late but has developed rapidly. The most productive journal, institution, and author in this field are Energy Policy, Resources for the Future, and Pizer from the USA, respectively. The auctorial and institutional cooperation degrees are growing and still have a broad collaboration space, but the cooperation among countries is fluctuating at a lower level. Nonetheless, the USA keeps its significant international cooperation ties. The bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis reveals that articles in this field are closely related to one another. The basic literature in the field was written by Weitzman and published in 1974, and the article by Nordhaus published in Science in 1992 is the most cited in the field.

26,The Potential Gains from Carbon Emissions Trading in China’s Industrial Sectors,"The command and control mechanism and the market trading mechanism have been adopted by Chinese government to reduce the industrial carbon emissions. Concerns have arisen over which policy is more effective and what are the potential gains from carbon emissions trading for industrial sectors. A Data Envelopment Analysis based linear programming technology is used to compare the industrial potential gains including both the economic potential gains and the environmental potential gains from the command and control and carbon emissions trading mechanisms. An empirical study containing the data set of 38 sub-industries in China from 2006–2014 is conducted. The empirical results show that the carbon emissions trading mechanism can produce more potential gains compared with the command and control mechanism, with an average of 69.6 and 92.0% economic potential gains and 49.1 and 21.0% environmental potential gains in terms of the overall level and industrial level, respectively. Additionally, the environmental potential gains of each sub-industry can provide theoretical support for the emission quotas allocation. Finally, several policy implications based on the empirical results are proposed.",2018-12-01,10.1007/s10614-017-9724-2,"['Yu, Yanni', 'Zhang, Weijie', 'Zhang, Ning']",Computational Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10614-017-9724-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
27,Emission Trading with Fiscal Externalities: The Case for a Common Carbon Tax for the Non-ETS Emissions in the EU,"A government is fiscally constrained if it is unable to raise sufficient tax revenue to finance the first-best level of public spending. When involved in emission trading, a fiscally constrained government will potentially seek to close its fiscal gap through emission permit sales. This fiscal incentive therefore generates a fiscal externality in the permit market that is endogenous to the extent of fiscal constrainedness among the participating countries. Our theory explains how, and when, fiscal externalities may be expected to arise. Moreover, we show that in a permit market equilibrium with fiscal externalities, the initial allocation of emission permits between countries will affect: (1) the price of emission permits, (2) the global distribution of abatement effort, and (3) total greenhouse gas mitigation costs. This is contrary to the textbook model of emission permit markets. Our findings are especially relevant for the EU which is about to allow for trading in emission rights between EU member countries for all emissions outside the European Emissions Trading System.",2018-11-01,10.1007/s10640-017-0184-x,"['Andersen, Jørgen Juel', 'Greaker, Mads']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-017-0184-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

We show that emission trading has significant impact on the optimal strategies and profits of the two regions. We find that cooperation between the regions leads to increased abatement and lower emissions, resulting in a lower pollution stock.

29,Intertemporal Emission Permits Trading Under Uncertainty and Irreversibility,"This paper analyzes the effect of emission permit banking on clean technology investment and abatement under conditions where the stringency of the future cap is uncertain. We examine the problem of heterogeneous firms minimizing the cost of intertemporal emission control in the presence of stochastic future pollution standards and emission permits that are tradable across firms and through time. A firm can invest in clean capital (an improved pollution abatement technology) to reduce its abatement cost. We consider two possibilities: that investment is reversible or irreversible. Uncertainty is captured within a two period model: only the current period cap is known. We show that if banking is positive and marginal abatement costs are sufficiently convex, there will be more abatement and investment in clean technology under uncertainty than there would be under certainty and no banking. These results are at odds with the common belief that uncertainty on future environmental policy is a barrier to investment in clean capital. Moreover, under uncertainty and irreversibility, we find that there are cases where banking enables firms to invest more in clean capital.",2018-09-01,10.1007/s10640-017-0137-4,"['Pommeret, Aude', 'Schubert, Katheline']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-017-0137-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

31,Pricing Carbon,"Among the key climate-policy challenges we face is the need to price carbon appropriately without which our required transition to a low-carbon economy will not come about for lack of proper price signals and incentives. But how do we price an invisible pollutant like CO_2? That price is inversely related to the world community’s carbon budget Carbon budget imposed by the Paris Agreement’s objective of limiting the average temperature hike. One method would be to relate the carbon price Carbon price to the so-called social cost of carbon Social cost of carbon (SCC) as a pollutant damaging the environment. Another method to price carbon would be in relation to the marginal cost of abatement linked to climate-mitigating investment projects. Treating greenhouse gas emissions as just another negative externality, we have so far used traditional approaches of proposing either a market-oriented solution as in various cap-and-trade schemes or an emissions tax. But neither such carbon markets nor carbon taxes Carbon tax have proven adequate up to now, pointing to the need for stronger solutions in the near future.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-92357-4_5,"['Guttmann, Robert']",Eco-Capitalism,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-92357-4_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

33,An Introduction to the Book,"This book is based on the insights gained from studies led by the authors between 2010 and 2015; a few of the studies are also extensively described in four of the chapters here. The focus of this book sits at the nexus of three interrelated fields of study: environmental policy, market microstructure and environmental financial economics. Specifically, three main issues (liquidity, price discovery and market efficiency) are investigated using data from the two major emissions permit trading venues within the European Union-Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS). These two venues, along with several others in Europe, constitute the largest regional market for emission permits (see Daskalakis et al. 2011 for detailed discussions; Chap. 2 also provides a descriptive analysis of the market).",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-72847-6_1,"['Ibikunle, Gbenga', 'Gregoriou, Andros']",Carbon Markets,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-72847-6_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
34,Technology Adoption Optimization with Heterogeneous Agents and Carbon Emission Trading Mechanism,"The adoption of new technologies with high efficiency and low emission is of great importance in achieving sustainable development. Most studies of technology adoption have been criticized of idealistically assuming only one global decision agent. In this paper, a model of optimizing technology adoption with heterogeneous agents is proposed. Each agent attempts to identify the optimal solution for a portion of the entire system. The heterogeneity in agents is the different demands they face. In order to internalize the external effects of emission, a quantity-based market incentive policy instruments - Carbon Emission Trading is implemented. With two heterogeneous agents, a bargaining process is introduced to reasonably allocate the profit to them. Computational tests are conducted with different market shares and different discounting factors. Numerical results show the impact of heterogeneity and carbon emission trading mechanism on the optimal technology adoptions. It is suggested that a smaller gap of agents’ market shares leads to earlier and more adoptions. Besides, adoptions remain no change when both agents have a same discounting factor. A big discounting factor of the seller will accelerate the adoptions in the buyer agent and the entire system if agents have different discounting factors.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-75429-1_20,"['Fang, Chenhao', 'Ma, Tieju']",Integrated Uncertainty in Knowledge Modelling and Decision Making,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-75429-1_20,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
35,Liquidity and Market Efficiency in Carbon Markets,"This chapter examines the relationship between liquidity and market efficiency in carbon markets, by using analysing trading data from the world’s largest carbon exchange, the ECX. Results obtained show that there is a strong relationship between liquidity and market efficiency such that when spreads narrow, return predictability diminishes. This relationship is more pronounced for the highest trading carbon financial instruments and during periods of low liquidity. Since the start of trading in Phase II of the EU-ETS prices have continuously moved nearer to unity with efficient, random walk benchmarks, and this improves from year to year. Overall, findings suggest that trading quality in the EU-ETS has improved markedly and matured over the sample period (2008–2011).",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-72847-6_6,"['Ibikunle, Gbenga', 'Gregoriou, Andros']",Carbon Markets,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-72847-6_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
36,Green and Blue Dividends and Environmental Tax Reform: Dynamic CGE Model,"The challenge of climate change needs to be tackled with environmental policies carefully designed to achieve environmental benefits and avoid negative economic effects. The introduction of an environmental tax in the economic system can generate a double benefit represented by the attainment of the environmental target (first or green dividend) and other additional benefits (second/third or blue dividends) represented by gains in welfare, employment, consumption etc. In this perspective, the general equilibrium analysis is able to quantify the environmental and welfare direct and indirect effects that an environmental policy generates within the economic system. Since international environmental agreements set clear target deadlines on the reduction of GHG emissions, in this chapter a dynamic CGE model based on a bi-regional SAM framework for Italy is developed.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-58533-8_10,"['Severini, Francesca', 'Pretaroli, Rosita', 'Socci, Claudio']",The New Generation of Computable General Equilibrium Models,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-58533-8_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
37,A new way of carbon accounting emphasises the crucial role of sustainable timber use for successful carbon mitigation strategies,"The roles of forest management and the use of timber for energy in the global carbon cycle are discussed. Recent studies assert that past forest management has been accelerating climate change, for example in Europe. In addition, the increasing tendency to burn timber is an international concern. Here, we show a new way of carbon accounting considering the use of timber as a carbon neutral transfer into a pool of products. This approach underlines the robust, positive carbon mitigation effects of sustainable timber harvesting. Applying this new perspective, sustainable timber use can be interpreted not as a removal but a prevention of carbon being converted within the cycle of growth and respiration. Identifying timber use as a prevention rather than a removal leads to the understanding of timber use as being no source of carbon emissions of forests but as a carbon neutral transfer to the product pool. Subsequently, used timber will then contribute to carbon emissions from the pool of forest products in the future. Therefore, timber use contributes to carbon mitigation by providing a substantial delay of emissions. In a second step, the carbon model is applied to results of a previous study in which different timber price scenarios were used to predict timber harvests in Bavarian forests (Germany). Thus, the influence of the economic dimension “timber price” on the ecological dimension carbon sequestration was derived. It also shows that these effects are stable, even if an increasing tendency of burning timber products for producing energy is simulated. Linking an economic optimization to a biophysical model for carbon mitigation shows how the impact of management decisions on the environment can be derived. Overall, a sustainably managed system of forests and forest products contributes to carbon mitigation in a positive, stable way, even if the prices for (energy) wood rise substantially.",2017-12-01,10.1007/s11027-016-9720-1,"['Härtl, Fabian H.', 'Höllerl, Sebastian', 'Knoke, Thomas']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-016-9720-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
38,Allocation of emission permits using DEA-game-theoretic model,"This paper discusses schemes for allocation of emission permits (AEP) among a group of manufacturing companies, aiming at controlling the total emissions of the group while maintaining efficient production. Game theory and data envelopment analysis have been integrated in different ways for constructing two variants of AEP models. The first situation is where all members in the group are cooperative and a reasonable permit allocation scheme maximizes the overall payoff of the group. The second situation is where group members are non-cooperative and each member makes every effort to selfishly maximize its own payoff. The decision maker allocates permits to firms according to their non-cooperative game equilibrium scores. Proposed models are applied to study a group of paper mills to analyze their payoffs. The results show that the methods proposed in this work can provide reasonable allocation results for all firms. In addition, although our allocation methods adopt the principle of maximizing the payoff of the firm, the efficiency of each firm from current output and input levels is still a factor that determines the permit allocation.",2017-10-01,10.1007/s12351-016-0289-y,"['Sun, Jiasen', 'Fu, Yelin', 'Ji, Xiang', 'Zhong, Ray Y.']",Operational Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12351-016-0289-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
39,Solution algorithms for regional interactions in large-scale integrated assessment models of climate change,"We present two solution algorithms for a large-scale integrated assessment model of climate change mitigation: the well known Negishi algorithm and a newly developed Nash algorithm. The algorithms are used to calculate the Pareto-optimum and competitive equilibrium, respectively, for the global model that includes trade in a number of goods as an interaction between regions. We demonstrate that in the absence of externalities both algorithms deliver the same solution. The Nash algorithm is computationally much more effective, and scales more favorably with the number of regions. In the presence of externalities between regions the two solutions differ, which we demonstrate by the inclusion of global spillovers from learning-by-doing in the energy sector. The non-cooperative treatment of the spillover externality in the Nash algorithm leads to a delay in the expansion of renewable energy installations compared to the cooperative solution derived using the Negishi algorithm.",2017-08-01,10.1007/s10479-016-2340-z,"['Leimbach, Marian', 'Schultes, Anselm', 'Baumstark, Lavinia', 'Giannousakis, Anastasis', 'Luderer, Gunnar']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-016-2340-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
40,Optimal Policy Mechanism Design for Cross-Sector and Multi-Stage Pollution Control with a Bilevel Model: Application to SO_2 Emission in China,"In this paper, we construct a multi-stage coordinated programming model under tax system to control SO_2 emission. The model is based on an explicitly formulated SO_2 abatement cost function created under Chinese condition. Analysis of the effectiveness and impact on the economy of the model is carried out with consideration of game theory. By solving the model, theoretical results show that the volume-based multi-stage SO_2 tax system has two properties: effectiveness and equal-rate. Based on these theoretical results, empirical study is also performed using Chinese historical data. Compared with yearly single-stage programming model, the tax rate generated by the coordinated multi-stage programming model is time-invariant and rather moderate in scale. The total abatement cost among planning years in our model is 21.03 % less than the actual number and 6.68 % less than that in the single-stage situation. The tax payment suggested by our model is 10.62 % less than by the single-stage model. In general, a coordinated multi-stage programming model helps reduce the overall costs of environmental protection while achieving the same emission control target with less burden added to the economy.",2017-06-01,10.1007/s10666-016-9533-3,"['Li, Xu', 'Liu, Zimeng', 'Xu, Qing', 'Jiang, Zhongyi', 'Ma, Guoliang']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10666-016-9533-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
41,Carbon Trading Reporting: The Case of Spanish Companies,"Policy makers, scientists, industry leaders, and academicians all have debated how to restrain global warming and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Three main methods are used: command and control laws and regulations, carbon taxes, and cap and trade schemes. Recognizing the consequences of global warming, all Scandinavian countries introduced a carbon emissions tax in the 1990s. They also ratified the Kyoto Protocol that ran from 2005 through 2012. The European Union (EU) instituted a carbon trading scheme (Emissions Trading System (ETS)) in February 2005 when Kyoto became operative. The three Scandinavian EU members had two methods in place during the 2005–08 period to encourage GHG reduction: taxing and trading. Norway, not in the EU, used just taxes. The other EU members, including Spain, applied just the carbon trading ETS scheme to encourage compliance with the Kyoto Protocol. The fundamental issue addressed is this one: Did publicly held firms headquartered in Spain adequately report participation in the EU carbon emissions trading mechanism? Data to answer this question were obtained from the 2011 and 2012 annual reports for domestic Spanish public companies that received tradable emissions permits. In addition to assessing investor-owned firms’ disclosure posture, the specific method of reporting about carbon emissions permits, whether companies used, banked, or sold the permits granted by the government, also is reviewed. This empirical research effort reports on a complete survey of all available data for the two financial reporting periods that concluded the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol.",2017-05-01,10.1007/s11294-017-9634-z,"['Stagliano, A.

42,An Inexact Pricing Model for Tradable Water Pollution Emission Permit and Its Application in Chaohu Lake Watershed,"Water pollution emission permit trading system is an effective way to coordinate economic development and pollution control, is widely used. However, uncertainties and hierarchical management structures widely exist in the system, and play an important role. In this research, a triangular fuzzy random variable is employed to deal with the dual uncertainty with both fuzziness and randomness. The bi-level relationship in pricing for water pollution emission permit has been clarified, and then, an inexact bi-level pricing model for water pollution emission permit trading has been established based on this bi-level relationship. An algorithm named the fuzzy random simulation based nested genetic algorithm with dynamic mutation has been designed to solve the proposed model. The model was applied to an actual case, the impact of the pricing of water pollution emission permit on its trading and the impact mechanism have been discussed and analyzed. It was found that the higher the price of water emission permit, the less of it will be traded, and vice versa. Further, the upper boundary of pricing water pollutant j emission permit is $$\frac{p_{ik}-C_{ik}-M_k}{EV(\widetilde{\overline{E}}_{ijk})}$$ p i k - C i k - M k E V ( E ¯ ~ i j k ) .

43,Some Economics of International Climate Policy,"This chapter discusses economic aspects of international efforts to curb the global warming threat. The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol expired in 2012, which has until then been the dominant climate agreement although competing – or allegedly complement – international climate protection schemes like the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate also existed. While as of 5 April 2011, the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP) Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP) formally concluded its joint work, tangible preparations for a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol started at the climate conference in Montreal (comprising MOP and COP-11) in 2005. In Montreal, a new working group was established for the discussion of future commitments (after 2012). And at the COP-18 in Doha in 2012, an agreement on a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol for 2013–2020 could be reached. In this chapter, we describe the main features of Kyoto and APP schemes and their failure to establish an efficient global climate protection regime, and we elaborate on the disincentives for countries to commit to efficient climate protection efforts in an international agreement. In doing so we also take into account the growing importance of Adaptation to climate change adaptation to climate change in the international climate policy arena. The situation in international negotiations on climate change mitigation faced by national governments is depicted in game theoretic settings, and private ancillary benefits of climate policy are identified to raise the likelihood for countries joining an international agreement. Yet, it remains quite disputable to which extent ancillary benefits can be an impetus for more action in international climate policy. Finally, after dedicating a large part of the chapter to agreements, like the Kyoto Protocol, stipulating abatement quantities, alternative schemes are presented which were coined “price ducks” since they influence the effective prices of climate protection. By manipulating prices, e.g., via an international carbon tax, incentives are generated for producing higher climate protection levels. Recently, the so-called matching schemes influencing effective prices of climate protection raised much attention in the scientific literature. Such schemes may attenuate free- or easy-rider incentives in international climate policy and may even induce a globally efficient climate protection level.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_4,"['Pittel, Karen', 'Rübbelke, Dirk', 'Altemeyer-Bartscher, Martin', 'Otte, Sebastian']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
44,Emission trading for air pollution hot spots: getting the permit market right,"Conventional emission permit markets are inefficient for non-uniformly mixed pollutants that create geographic ‘hot spots’ of different ambient emission concentrations and environmental damage. Economically efficient ambient concentration contribution markets involve difficult interactions among multiple markets that makes them practically infeasible. Extending economic theory by Muller and Mendelsohn (Am Econ Rev 99(5):1714–1739, 2009 . doi: 10.1257/aer.99.5.1714 ) and others about ‘getting the prices right’ through bilateral trading ratios, this paper introduces theoretical simplifications and a novel type of single permit market with a hybrid price-quantity instrument that addresses the dual heterogeneity of firm-specific abatement costs and regional variation in damage.

45,Carbon Emission Governance Under Global Carbon Taxes,"One of the most essential environment problem human beings need to face is the global temperature rise caused by the emissions of greenhouse gases including CO_2, CH_4 and N_2O from human activities, among which CO_2 is the major one (IPCC 2007 ). Carbon tax policy has been generally considered as one of the most market effective measures for carbon emission abatement (Baranzini et al. 2000 ).

46,Public Choice Issues in International Collective Action: Global Warming Regulation,"Although there is a growing literature on scientific estimates and regulatory instruments for international efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions, the underlying political collective action processes have been neglected. We focus on the impact of uncertainty in assessing the benefits and costs of global warming regulation on constituencies and politicians in the bargaining countries. Uncertainty arises due to basic information problems about emissions and their link to global warming, the possible range of temperature changes, and their likely effects across the planet. These information problems also create uncertainty in calculating the net effects of global warming, determining its effective regulation, and assessing compliance by sovereign countries that may be differentially affected. We outline a two-stage analytical framework that describes the positions taken by representatives of negotiating countries and the internal public choice tradeoffs facing politicians when constituents are faced with differential and uncertain effects. We apply the framework to the Montreal Protocol to Control Substances that Damage the Ozone Layer of 1987 for insights in analyzing the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. Additional information will reduce uncertainty over time, and until uncertainty is lowered we conclude that limited regulatory efforts are most likely to generate internal political support within negotiating countries for international collective action.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-47828-9_2,"['Houser, Daniel', 'Libecap, Gary D.']",Explorations in Public Sector Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-47828-9_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
47,The Role of Aviation in Climate Change Mitigation,"This chapter summarizes the recent policy and research development of the aviation emission reduction and its mechanism. First we trace the policy process surrounding UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, and Post-Kyoto Protocol negotiations, mostly focusing on the activities in the ICAO. Key factors in the policy process are (1) the disparities in the field of international aviation among the nations, such as income level and preferences between environment and growth. Such disparities could be interpreted as the notion of “common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities (CBDR)” in the Kyoto Protocol. The second key factor is (2) uncertainties surrounding the impact of GHG emission on utilities of nations. Then we look into the theoretical developments in the field of international aviation from the economics viewpoint. Main objectives are to illustrate the impact of market-based mechanism (MBM), such as the emission allowance trading, and the inherent difficulties to reach social optimal allocations through the bargaining among nations in the presence of nations’ disparities and uncertainties of GHG emission’s impact on nations’ utilities.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_60,"['Hihara, Katsuya']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_60,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
48,Approaches to carbon allowance allocation in China: a computable general equilibrium analysis,"China is preparing to develop and implement an emissions trading system in its 13th five-year plan. Allowance allocation is one of the key issues to settle during the establishment of this system. This study applies the China Energy and Environmental Policy Analysis model to assess how the allowances should be allocated. Simulation results show that, while impacts on China’s economic development vary according to how allowances are allocated, the negative impacts cannot be mitigated completely, which are between −0.5 and −0.1 % when 5 % of carbon emissions are reduced. In terms of the impacts on the macroeconomy, sectoral output, and capital revenue, results suggest that auctioning the allowances and recycling the revenue to reduce the indirect tax will perform best in alleviating the negative impacts. Meanwhile, impacts of carbon mitigation on international competitiveness can be reduced most in the approach where only key energy- and trade-intensive sectors are able to receive free allowances. However, if citizens’ welfare and quality of life is prioritized, auctioning the allowance and transferring the revenue to households in proportion to their occupation will be the most effective approach; in this case, the negative impacts on rural households’ disposable incomes and welfare will be reduced, and the income gap between rural and urban households will be narrowed.",2016-11-01,10.1007/s11069-016-2352-7,"['Yao, Yun-Fei', 'Liang, Qiao-Mei']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-016-2352-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
49,Carbon emission mitigation through regulatory policies and operations adaptation in supply chains: theoretic developments and extensions,"Along with carbon emission regulations launched by governments and consumers’ rising concerns about climate changes and global carbon footprint, interests of academia and industry have risen in carbon-efficient supply chain management. This research focuses on some product supply chain to make a literature review-based investigation on proposing a theoretical framework. We also solve potential research issues of how diverse carbon emission regulations can work on supply chain performance as well as emission; in what way we can find coordination mechanisms and optimal policies for supply chain operations to abate emission and enhance system profitability within different scenarios; and also to evaluate the effect on emission reduction for each emission regulation aforementioned through comparing their associated supply chain performances and system emission. Both practitioners in industry and academia might find this study useful, as it generates concepts with a formal framework of potential and values theoretical issues in the emerging field of carbon-efficient supply chain management which combines carbon emission regulations with mature operation management to enrich the theory of supply chain management. This study is perhaps to be valuable and constructive both for operational decisions in firms and for the enactment as well as implementation of emission-reduction regulations.

Fiscal policy and emission permit issuance can both be used as short-run stabilization tools in a closed economy although the former is ineffective in a small open economy.

53,Green Modernization Issues and Sustainability Indicators,"Climate policy has become a key element of modern economic policy in a world economy facing the challenges of long-run economic growth—associated with a rising use of energy—and the need to limit global warming. A global temperature rise of more than 2° relative to 1850 seems to bring a considerable risk of warming and hence there is a need for enhanced energy efficiency on the demand side and for a rising share of renewables, which, however, cannot be achieved without considerable cost. Innovation is a natural part of the process toward a less CO_2-intensive way of energy generation and it is also necessary for sustainability. The latter is a broad concept and requires that current generations adjust their production and consumption patterns—i.e., lifestyles—in such a way that future generations will have no less favorable prospects for economic prosperity and a healthy life than the current population. In the public debate, as in the discussions in the political system, there is a need to understand the comprehensive challenges of sustainability; to that end, a compact composite indicator for sustainability is needed to signal the current ecological stress and the ecological quality, respectively.

Failing to address these challenges appropriately could easily result in stronger emission. According to statistics from the International Energy Agency in 2011, China’s carbon dioxide emissions exceeded those of the United States by 2.6 billion tons. Chinese emissions exceeded aggregate emissions of the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Brazil by 450 million tons, compared with other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-662-49071-6_1,"['Huang, Weiguang', 'Wang, Mingquan', 'Wang, Jun', 'Gao, Kun', 'Li, Song', 'Liu, Chen']","China Low-Carbon Healthy City, Technology Assessment and Practice",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-662-49071-6_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

Many countries across the world have adopted the low - carbon development mode, with the latter aimed at reducing carbon emissions from human activities. And many international organizations, national governments introduce policies and laws to promote low - carbon mode of development.

56,Low Carbon Energy Systems in China: Visioning Regional Cooperation Through the Belt and Road,"China’s energy consumption growth is slowing down with the shifting to “new normal” of China’s economy. The contradiction between energy supply and demand has been greatly alleviated. With the strengthening of improving local air quality and combating climate change, the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption is expect to rise, which will result to a growing demand for high-quality and clean energy. The Chinese government has determined to promote the development of the low-carbon economy, and coordinated the economy development with the environment and the greenhouse gas emission especially since 2000. Accordingly, a series of purpose-built policies regarding low-carbon development in China have been launched, and significant achievements have been made. The scenario analysis method, combined with the top-down approach and bottom-up approach, was adopted to help forecast the medium- and long-term energy development in China. Based on the scenario analysis results, the road-map and milestones toward the low-carbon development were illustrated and sorted-out.

57,"Emission Discharge Permits, Ambient Concentrations, and a Margin of Safety: Trading Solutions with a Computer-Assisted Smart Market for Air Quality","The process of calculating market-clearing prices for cap and trade policies for air quality remains problematic. The permit trading processes are designed to mimic the cost-minimizing outcome. An additional shortcoming is the lack of attention to elements of uncertainty in the permit price calculations. In this paper, we design a market process for allocating permits to achieve the same type of behavior we observe for each decision-maker in the overall cost minimization model. We aim to design a modeling system that would be easy and efficient to operate. We use a method known as a computer-assisted “smart market” which has been used in a number of electricity-pricing situations proposed and applied to some types of environmental and resource management problems. The theoretical structure of the smart market model with a safety margin is provided and then the elements of the margin of safety are explored in depth. Finally, a set of pricing rules for the permits that reflect a margin of safety are examined, and issues related to their implementation are explored.",2015-08-01,10.1007/s10666-014-9436-0,"['Willett, Keith', 'Caplanova, Anetta', 'Sivak, Rudolf']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10666-014-9436-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
58,Does Environmental Information Disclosure Benefit Waste Discharge Reduction? Evidence from China,"As a tool for regulating the environment in China, does environmental information disclosure reduce pollutant discharge? To answer this question, we empirically analyzed the emission data of “the three wastes” (i.e., waste gas, wastewater, and solid waste) in unit industrial GDP in 31 provincial units. As a measure to reduce institutional emission, environmental information disclosure only slightly influenced waste discharge reduction in the implementation period of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan of China. Instead, command control and market-based tools significantly affected waste discharge reduction. Representative measures included penalties and charges. With the continuously enhanced pressure of control, environmental information disclosure facilitates the effects of command control tools on waste discharge reduction. Content analysis of environmental information disclosed by sample listed companies in Jiangsu Province was conducted. The disclosure of insufficient environmental information on emission reduction can be attributed to “adverse selection” in system performance (i.e., the selective disclosure trend considering “greenwashing” in the listed companies) and to the limited quality of overall environmental information disclosure. This study provides empirical evidence for Chinese policy makers to improve the system for environmental information disclosure of listed companies.",2015-07-01,10.1007/s10551-014-2173-0,"['Huang, Rongbing', 'Chen, Danping']",Journal of Business Ethics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10551-014-2173-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

60,Emissions trading system and supporting policies under an emissions reduction framework,"Emission trading system plays an increasingly important vole in reducing the pollution for environment. Through mathematical models, an analysis is made on the emissions trading system under an emission reduction framework. Four conclusions are drawn: (1) The impact by environmental taxes on the existing firm’s choices of optimal discharging amounts is uncertain, the existing firm’s discharging amounts will decrease with the increased prices of emissions permits, and paid initial emissions allowances will reduce the existing firm’s profits; (2) Under an intertemporal trading system, the existing firm’s holding permits conforms to the principle of profit maximization; (3) Under the intertemporal trading system, the prices for emissions permits for the entrant firms are always on the rise and so are their access costs into the industries, thus frustrating local governments’ efforts in attracting investments; and (4) Emissions reduction policy is a good regulatory measure for promoting local economic welfare and realizing sustainable development. Some suggestions are also given for triggering and activating the emissions trading system and formulating supportive policies, such as local governments are obliged to set prices for initial emissions permits to dampen the purchasing impulse of the existing firm and to avoid a thin market of emissions permits.",2015-05-01,10.1007/s10479-012-1152-z,"['Song, Ma-Lin', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Qiu, Xiao-Ming']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-012-1152-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

Decarbonising the energy system is critical in mitigating climate change. This chapter summarises modelling methodologies developed in the ETSAP community to assess economic impacts of decarbonising energy systems at a global level.

The range of economic impacts is regionally dependent upon the stage of economic development, the level of industrialisation, energy intensity of exports, and competition effects due to rates of relative decarbonisation. Developed nation’s decarbonisation targets are estimated to result in a manageable GDP loss in the region of 2 % by 2050.

In 2007, a cooperative differential game model of transboundary industrial pollution was presented by Yeung. It is the first time that time-consistent solutions are derived in a cooperative differential game on pollution control with industries and governments being separate entities. In this paper, we extend Yeung’s model to an even more general model, in which emission permits trading is taken into account.

64,From federal to city mitigation and adaptation: climate change policy in Mexico City,"Climate change is projected to affect Latin America and the Caribbean as a result of increased temperatures and changed rainfall patterns. The impacts of climate change are expected to be unevenly distributed throughout the region, due to differences in geographic location, demographic pressures, levels of poverty, and natural resource dependence. To date, few studies have explored these impacts and the governmental responses to cope with them at a city scale. This article examines the challenges faced by the Mexico City government as it translates the federal climate change policy into successful mitigation and adaptation. It analyzes climate change impacts on Mexico and Mexico City (also known as the Federal District), the federal and city’s mitigation and adaptation responses, and advances and contradictions in the implementation of these strategies at the national and city levels. Similar problems have limited the effectiveness of these actions at both the federal and city levels, including the overexploitation of natural resources, a lack of climate information and monitoring systems, and the subordination of climate change strategies to the objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. These problems have resulted in poor coordination and collaboration among various levels of government to cope with climate change, in addition to avoiding local capacity building, particularly in regard to forest conservation.",2014-10-01,10.1007/s11027-013-9455-1,"['Sosa-Rodriguez, Fabiola S.']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-013-9455-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
65,Economic impacts of alternative greenhouse gas emission metrics: a model-based assessment,"In this paper we study the impact of alternative metrics on short- and long-term multi-gas emission reduction strategies and the associated global and regional economic costs and emissions budgets. We compare global warming potentials with three different time horizons (20, 100, 500 years), global temperature change potential and global cost potentials with and without temperature overshoot. We find that the choice of metric has a relatively small impact on the CO_2 budget compatible with the 2° target and therefore on global costs. However it substantially influences mid-term emission levels of CH_4, which may either rise or decline in the next decades as compared to today’s levels. Though CO_2 budgets are not affected much, we find changes in CO_2 prices which substantially affect regional costs. Lower CO_2 prices lead to more fossil fuel use and therefore higher resource prices on the global market. This increases profits of fossil-fuel exporters. Due to the different weights of non-CO_2 emissions associated with different metrics, there are large differences in nominal CO_2 equivalent budgets, which do not necessarily imply large differences in the budgets of the single gases. This may induce large shifts in emission permit trade, especially in regions where agriculture with its high associated CH_4 emissions plays an important role. Furthermore it makes it important to determine CO_2 equivalence budgets with respect to the chosen metric. Our results suggest that for limiting warming to 2 °C in 2100, the currently used GWP100 performs well in terms of global mitigation costs despite its conceptual simplicity.",2014-08-01,10.1007/s10584-014-1188-y,"['Strefler, Jessica', 'Luderer, Gunnar', 'Aboumahboub, Tino', 'Kriegler, Elmar']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-014-1188-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
66,Experimental comparison between markets on dynamic permit trading and investment in irreversible abatement with and without non-regulated companies,"This paper examines the investment strategies of compliance companies in irreversible abatement technologies and the environmental achievements of the system in an inter-temporal cap-and-trade market using laboratory experiments. The experimental analysis is performed under varying market structures: firstly, in a market that is exclusive to compliance companies and subsequently, in a market that is open to both compliance and non-compliance entities. In line with theoretical models on irreversible abatement investment, the paper shows that regulated companies trade permits at a premium. Also, steep per unit penalties for excess emissions prompt early investments in irreversible abatement technologies. Further, the paper shows that by contributing to the permit demand and supply, non-compliance companies (i) enhance the exchange of permits, helping the system to achieve a zero-excess permit position, (ii) increase the price levels, but has no apparent effect on price variability.",2014-08-01,10.1007/s11149-013-9238-3,"['Taschini, Luca', 'Chesney, Marc', 'Wang, Mei']",Journal of Regulatory Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11149-013-9238-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

The simulation results represent that the total assets and profits of the carbon sequestration project (CSP) buyer and seller are steadily on the increase in the carbon trading market. The market regulatory efficiency is determined by the market investment and the improvement of regulation policy. Furthermore, the real sample simulation of Sichuan Daduhe Forest CSP demonstrates that the profit of CSP traded in the CSM is higher than the profit from the transactions of outside exchange. It implies that establishing CSM is an effective way to improve the CSP business for investors and a positive action to response to global warming as well.

69,Innovation benefits from nuclear phase-out: can they compensate the costs?,"This paper investigates whether an inefficient allocation of abatement due to constraints on the use of currently available low carbon mitigation options can promote innovation in new technologies and have a positive impact on welfare. We focus on the case of a nuclear power phase-out and endogenous technical change in energy efficiency and alternative low carbon technologies. The research is inspired by the re-thinking about nuclear power deployment which took place in some countries, especially in Western Europe, after the Fukushima accident in March 2011. The analysis uses an Integrated Assessment Model, WITCH, which features multiple externalities related to greenhouse gas emissions and innovation market failures. Our results show that phasing out nuclear power stimulates R&D investments and deployment of technologies with large learning potential. The resulting technology benefits that would not otherwise occur due to intertemporal and international externalities almost completely offset the economic costs of foregoing nuclear power. The extent of technology benefits depends on the stringency of the climate policy and is distributed unevenly across countries.",2014-04-01,10.1007/s10584-013-0870-9,"['Cian, Enrica', 'Carrara, Samuel', 'Tavoni, Massimo']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-013-0870-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
70,Some Economics of International Climate Policy,"This chapter discusses economic aspects of international efforts to curb the global warming threat. The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol expired in 2012, which has until then been the dominant climate agreement although competing – or allegedly complement – international climate protection schemes like the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate also existed. While as of 5 April 2011, the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP) Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP) formally concluded its joint work, tangible preparations for a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol started at the climate conference in Montreal (comprising MOP and COP-11) in 2005. In Montreal, a new working group was established for the discussion of future commitments (after 2012). And at the COP-18 in Doha in 2012, an agreement on a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol for 2013–2020 could be reached. In this chapter, we describe the main features of Kyoto and APP schemes and their failure to establish an efficient global climate protection regime, and we elaborate on the disincentives for countries to commit to efficient climate protection efforts in an international agreement. In doing so we also take into account the growing importance of Adaptation to climate change adaptation to climate change in the international climate policy arena. The situation in international negotiations on climate change mitigation faced by national governments is depicted in game theoretic settings, and private ancillary benefits of climate policy are identified to raise the likelihood for countries joining an international agreement. Yet, it remains quite disputable to which extent ancillary benefits can be an impetus for more action in international climate policy. Finally, after dedicating a large part of the chapter to agreements, like the Kyoto Protocol, stipulating abatement quantities, alternative schemes are presented which were coined “price ducks” since they influence the effective prices of climate protection. By manipulating prices, e.g., via an international carbon tax, incentives are generated for producing higher climate protection levels. Recently, the so-called matching schemes influencing effective prices of climate protection raised much attention in the scientific literature. Such schemes may attenuate free- or easy-rider incentives in international climate policy and may even induce a globally efficient climate protection level.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_4-2,"['Pittel, Karen', 'Rübbelke, Dirk', 'Altemeyer-Bartscher, Martin', 'Otte, Sebastian']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_4-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
71,Development and Application of Economic and Environmental Models of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agriculture: Some Difficult Choices for Policy Makers,"This chapter describes how economic models designed to examine agricultural policy can be adapted to explore environmental applications such as the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture to a 2050 time horizon. The tensions between environmental policy aimed at reducing GHG emissions, and policies promoting agricultural production to increase food security are explored. Ireland is a major net exporter of beef and milk products, with agriculture representing a high share of non-Emissions Trading Scheme (non-ETS) GHG emissions. Ireland is used to illustrate an issue which has wide-scale global implications. The feasibility of achieving emission reductions is examined in the absence of technical abatement measures. Instead, to reduce emissions the size of the suckler herd is limited. However, it is found that even eliminating the suckler herd would leave emissions well short of achieving a 20 % reduction target. Even a 10 % GHG emissions reduction, while possible under this approach, is likely to be politically unfeasible. The tension between environmental and food security is likely to be replicated at a global level, given the significant contribution of agricultural production to anthropogenic climate change. The chapter highlights the importance of detailed modelling of future emissions in advance of setting feasible emissions reduction targets.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-06635-6_13,"['Donnellan, Trevor', 'Hanrahan, Kevin', 'Breen, James P.']",Agricultural Cooperative Management and Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-06635-6_13,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
72,Implementing a Developing Country’s Global Environmental Commitments: Industry Perspectives on Potential Pollution Prevention Programs in Bangladesh,"This chapter is positioned in the literature that discusses the tension between global environmental commitments and local implementation from the perspective of a developing country. It focuses on the implementation of international conventions, treaties and protocols signed and ratified by Bangladesh, as evidenced by the existence of related programs. The programs examined in this study were proposed by the Asian Development Bank in 1994, based on international best practices for industrial pollution prevention. The chapter also frames the regulatory, market-based and voluntary initiatives on a policy continuum from compliance, cooperative and collaborative approaches and compares the perceived existence of these approaches. The business perspectives of these programs are analyzed in the tannery, pulp and paper, fertilizer, textile and cement industries. Results show that although there are environmental regulations for preventing industrial pollution in Bangladesh, they are not as effective or comprehensive as they could be. The study also found that voluntary programs and economic incentive programs are present to a very limited extent.

74,The Role of Aviation in Climate Change Mitigation,"This chapter summarizes the recent policy and research development of the aviation emission reduction and its mechanism. First we trace the policy process surrounding UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, and Post-Kyoto Protocol negotiations, mostly focusing on the activities in the ICAO. Key factors in the policy process are (1) the disparities in the field of international aviation among the nations, such as income level and preferences between environment and growth. Such disparities could be interpreted as the notion of “common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities (CBDR)” in the Kyoto Protocol. The second key factor is (2) uncertainties surrounding the impact of GHG emission on utilities of nations. Then we look into the theoretical developments in the field of international aviation from the economics viewpoint. Main objectives are to illustrate the impact of market-based mechanism (MBM), such as the emission allowance trading, and the inherent difficulties to reach social optimal allocations through the bargaining among nations in the presence of nations’ disparities and uncertainties of GHG emission’s impact on nations’ utilities.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_60-1,"['Hihara, Katsuya']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_60-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
75,A Good Opening: The Key to Make the Most of Unilateral Climate Action,"In this paper we argue that when a subgroup of countries cooperate on emission reduction, the optimal response of non-signatory countries reflects the interaction between three potentially opposing factors, the incentive to free-ride on the environmental benefits of cooperation, the incentive to expand energy consumption, and the incentive to adopt the cleaner technologies introduced by the coalition. Using an Integrated Assessment Model with a game-theoretic structure we find that the equilibrium abatement of the coalition composed by OECD countries would be moderate, in line with the Pledges subscribed in Copenhagen, but increasing. The mitigation strategy would consist of investments in energy R&D and deployment of cleaner technologies with high learning potentials. International knowledge and technology externalities would facilitate the diffusion of cleaner technologies in non-signatory countries, offsetting the free-riding incentive and reducing their emissions. If the OECD group curbs emissions beyond the optimal equilibrium level, reaching reduction rates between 40 and 45 % below 2005 levels in 2050, the benefits of technology externalities would no longer compensate the effect of lower fossil fuel prices. Our results suggest that a moderate unilateral climate policy could induce a virtuous behaviour in non-signatory countries and that policies promoting the international transfer of technologies and knowledge could represent an effective complement to mitigation targets.",2013-10-01,10.1007/s10640-013-9643-1,"['Bosetti, Valentina', 'De Cian, Enrica']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-013-9643-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
76,Rio+20: Looking Back at 20 Years of Environmental and Resource Economics,"Twenty years on from the Rio ’92 conference, we must face the fact that there have been a few successes but more failures. Scientific complexity, uncertainty, short-termism inherent in politics, the free-rider problem, and issues of fairness are part of the explanation for the lack of progress, but we point to more fundamental motivational problems. It is time to assess our responsibility as economists in the field of environment and resources. Our scientific contribution has been misleading because our models are structurally incapable of addressing major concerns. The cost-benefit test is not fit to assess large-scale resource conservation projects, including climate abatement. This understanding was already present during the Rio ‘92 summit, but the problems, while identified, have not been resolved twenty years later. The contribution from theory, through the sustainability paradigm of non-decreasing welfare, has turned out ineffective. It does not provide us with tools for designing a better future for our children. Instead, it risks choosing a constant welfare path, with knowledge increasing but natural resources deteriorating, while not properly analyzing the richer possibilities for a better future that nature and creativity imply.

77,Implementing Policy,"What policy instruments are available to governments wishing to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions? What role can and should government play? How effective is government action likely to be in reducing emissions and mitigating climate change? These are the subjects of this chapter. One concern is that government intervention to correct the market failure associated with global emissions of greenhouse gases leads to policy failure that worsens rather than helps the situation. The strengths and weaknesses of the main instruments in the policy – regulation, carbon taxes, subsidies and emissions trading – are examined in detail. While mandates are regularly employed, market instruments (taxes and cap-and-trade) are shown to be more efficient. With respect to emissions trading, corruption can be endemic because of potential windfalls from accessing grandfathered permits, from profits accruing to financial intermediaries, and from sale of dubious certificates or carbon offsets. The European Union’s Emissions Trading System, failed efforts by the U.S. Congress to agree on carbon legislation, and other cases are discussed. Regulation and subsidies play a dominant role, and are often justified on the grounds that they create green jobs; however, mandates and subsidies have resulted in policy failure, high costs to the economy, fewer and not greater numbers of jobs, and little in the way of reduced emissions of greenhouse gases.

78,Optimal strategic regulations in international emissions trading under imperfect competition,"This paper analyzes governments’ strategic regulations in an imperfectly competitive market of international emissions trading (IET). Whether and how governments intervene in IET is explored. If regulations are decided, it is optimal for price-influencing countries to subsidize but for price-taking countries to tax permit trading. Conducting simulations of the Annex-1 emissions trading, we discover that no-intervention of all countries cannot be supported by any equilibrium. In contrast, all or some countries would regulate at equilibrium. In the latter case, price-influencing countries would not regulate but price-taking countries would. This justifies the necessity of considering no-intervention as a policy choice, and shows that a country’s decisions about strategically regulating IET may be affected by other countries’ intervention resolutions.",2013-01-01,10.1007/s10018-012-0033-7,"['Lee, Tsung-Chen', 'Chen, Hsiao-Chi', 'Liu, Shi-Miin']",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10018-012-0033-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
79,"External Balance, Dynamic Efficiency and Welfare Effects of National Climate Policies","This chapter investigates domestic and foreign welfare effects of unilateral and multilateral permit policies in a two-country overlapping generations model with producer carbon emissions. We show that the welfare effects of a more stringent cap on emissions depend on the external balance of the policy implementing country, the dynamic (in)efficiency of the world economy and the preference for environmental quality. Under dynamic efficiency the global welfare loss of policy implementation in the net foreign creditor country is lower than of a policy implementation in the net foreign debtor country. Moreover, although the country which has unilaterally implemented a permit policy would gain from a multilateral policy, the associated welfare loss for the other country is larger than that of a unilateral policy abroad.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-33669-0_16,"['Farmer, Karl', 'Schelnast, Matthias']",Growth and International Trade,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-33669-0_16,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

When each government maximizes its steady-state economic and environmental welfare and one country is a net foreign creditor and the other one a net foreign debtor, it is nationally optimal for the creditor country with sufficiently high environmental preferences to choose a stricter permit level than the debtor country. However, the resulting Nash equilibrium permit levels are not Pareto efficient.

The developed IFMIEPM incorporates techniques of interval-parameter programming, fuzzy planning and mixed-integer programming within a general energy planning model. The IFMIEPM can not only be used for quantitatively analyzing a variety of policy scenarios that are associated with different levels of carbon tax policy, but also tackle uncertainties expressed as discrete intervals and fuzzy sets in energy and environment systems. Considering low, medium and high carbon tax rates, the model is applied to an ideal energy and environment system. The results indicate that reasonable solutions have been generated.

82,Mitigating methane emissions from livestock: a global analysis of sectoral policies,"Methane emissions from livestock enteric fermentation and manure management represent about 40% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector and are projected to increase substantially in the coming decades, with most of the growth occurring in non-Annex 1 countries. To mitigate livestock methane, incentive policies based on producer-level emissions are generally not feasible because of high administrative costs and producer transaction costs. In contrast, incentive policies based on sectoral emissions are likely administratively feasible, even in developing countries. This study uses an economic model of global agriculture to estimate the effects of two sectoral mitigation policies: a carbon tax and an emissions trading scheme based on average national methane emissions per unit of commodity. The analysis shows how the composition and location of livestock production and emissions change in response to the policies. Results illustrate the importance of global mitigation efforts: when policies are limited to Annex 1 countries, increased methane emissions in non-Annex 1 countries offset approximately two-thirds of Annex 1 emissions reductions. While non-Annex 1 countries face substantial disincentives to enacting domestic carbon taxes, developing countries could benefit from participating in a global sectoral emissions trading scheme. We illustrate one scheme in which non-Annex 1 countries collectively earn USD 2.4 billion annually from methane emission permit sales when methane is priced at USD 30/t CO_2-eq.",2012-05-01,10.1007/s10584-011-0206-6,"['Key, Nigel', 'Tallard, Gregoire']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-011-0206-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

The dominant climate agreement to date is the Kyoto Protocol, although competing – or allegedly complement – international climate protection schemes like the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate also exist. After describing the main features of these schemes and their failure to establish an efficient global climate protection regime, the disincentives for countries to commit to efficient climate protection efforts in an international agreement are elaborated on. The negotiation situation faced by national governments is depicted in game theoretic settings and private ancillary benefits of climate policy are identified to raise the likelihood for countries joining an international agreement. Yet, it remains quite disputable to which extent ancillary benefits can be an impetus for more action in international climate policy. Finally, after dedicating a large part of the chapter to agreements that, like the Kyoto Protocol, stipulate abatement quantities, alternative schemes are presented which were coined “price ducks” since they influence the effective prices of climate protection. By manipulating prices, e.g., via an international carbon tax, incentives are generated for producing higher climate protection levels. Recently, so-called matching schemes influencing effective prices of climate protection raised much attention in the scientific literature.

85,Carbon Tax: Economic Impact on the Latrobe Valley,"Australia’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita are presently among the highest compared to other developed nations. Currently Australia contributes 1.5 per cent of global GHG emissions (Garnaut, 2008). The electricity sector in Australia together with agriculture bears the largest proportion of the carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions, while brown coal’s share in Australian total GHG emissions is 15 per cent. In contrast to black coal mining, brown coal emissions are not fugitive, so the bulk of emissions associated with the brown coal are related to its use. Although 58 per cent of Australian power generation capacity is coal-fired, at present Australian power generation is dominated by coal with approximately 81 per cent of the total electricity generated produced by brown and black coal generators (Nelson, et al. 2010). Our Ecological Footprint (a measure of how much land and water area a human population requires to produce the resource it consumes and to absorb its wastes, using prevailing technology) is 7.8 global hectares per capita (Living Planet Report, 2008), well above the sustainable global level of 2 global hectares per capita. This is three times larger than the resources that our country can regenerate in the course of one year. In response to the climate change challenge, the Labour government proposed the following climate change strategy: Reduction of Australia’s GHG emissions by 5 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020 irrespective of other countries’ actions or by 15–20 per cent depending on the scale of global action (Australian Government Climate Change Plan, 2011). The long-term target is to reduce Australia’s GHG emissions by 80 per cent below 2000 levels by 2050 (Australian Government Climate Change Plan, 2011).",2012-01-01,10.1057/9781137025807_8,"['Barrett, Mereana', 'Maslyuk, Svetlana', 'Pambudi, Daniel']",Contemporary Issues in Mining,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/9781137025807_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

87,Promotion of Renewables and Energy Efficiency by Politics: Case Study of the European Union,"Since climate change has become an international concern, most of the developed countries have attempted to adopt energy policies to mitigate global warming and its side effects in the last years. The current energy model, based on fossil fuels and nuclear energy, has been the basis for the functioning and development of modern industrial society. Nevertheless, the threats of this model (environmental problems, exhaustion of fossil sources, possible inflation process and loss of competitiveness, dependency toward energy export countries, etc.) have forced a change in the EU’s traditional energy strategy (which was focused on the security of supply). The present energy model of the European Union, which supports its economic growth and prosperity, is 80% dependent on fossils fuels [ 1 ] and it is increasingly dependent on energy imported from Non-EU member countries, creating economic, social, political, and other risks for the Union. From the 1990s, the key objectives of the EU have been security of supply, competitiveness, and environmental protection, making renewable energy sources and energy efficiency the basis for its new energy strategy in the EU. However the lack of a common energy framework seems to have been an obstacle to reach those objectives. Therefore, the European Union has recently adopted new directives and instruments to create a unique energy framework in order to reach the mentioned targets but also to become the world leader in the impulse of renewable energy sources and in the employment of energy efficiency technologies. In this work the main problems of the conventional energy model (CEM) are explained. The basis, obstacles, and challenges for implementing a more sustainable energy model are also analyzed. Likewise, due to the strategic importance of the European Union leadership in developing and implementing new instruments and policies to mitigate climate change, this work is focused in its energy strategy. Thus, the recent energy directives and other measures adopted by the EU are discussed.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4419-7991-9_9,"['Martínez de Alegría Mancisidor, Itziar', 'Vicente Molina, M.

The major findings are that: (1) there exhibits a stable long-run equilibrium relationship between the SO_2 and CO_2 emission with the long-run elasticity being 2.15; (2) there exists a short-run relationship between these two emissions with the short-run elasticity being 0.04. In addition, following an exogenous shock that causes a deviation from the long-run equilibrium, it would take approximately 15 years for SO_2 emission to revert toward the long-run equilibrium path with an average annual convergence rate of 6.5%; (3) the derived ancillary benefits that is generated from one metric ton of CO_2 emission reduction, are 11.77 Yuan (approximately US$ 1.7) in the short run and 196.16 Yuan (US$ 30) in the long run. These findings are not only crucial from the econometric modeling perspective, but also have important policy implications.",2011-12-01,10.1007/s10113-011-0227-8,"['Zheng, Xinye', 'Zhang, Li', 'Yu, Yihua', 'Lin, Shi']",Regional Environmental Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10113-011-0227-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
90,An emission pathway for stabilization at 6 Wm^−2 radiative forcing,"Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0 (RCP6) is a pathway that describes trends in long-term, global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), short-lived species, and land-use/land-cover change leading to a stabilisation of radiative forcing at 6.0 Watts per square meter (Wm^−2) in the year 2100 without exceeding that value in prior years. Simulated with the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM), GHG emissions of RCP6 peak around 2060 and then decline through the rest of the century. The energy intensity improvement rates changes from 0.9% per year to 1.5% per year around 2060. Emissions are assumed to be reduced cost-effectively in any period through a global market for emissions permits. The exchange of CO_2 between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystem through photosynthesis and respiration are estimated with the ecosystem model.

91,The Costs of the Geological Disposal of Carbon Dioxide and Radioactive Waste,"Cost assessments of geological disposal of carbon dioxide and radioactive waste are presented. The scope of the cost assessments covers a range of activities from research, site identification, licensing and construction to operation, closure and post-closure monitoring of the disposal sites. The most meaningful indicator for comparison is the disposal cost per unit of electricity produced. The comparative assessment reveals important differences between the two waste products in the volume of material involved and the precautions to be taken that determine the cost per kWh indicator. The timing of investment to establish the disposal site is an important difference with significant cost implications: investments must be completed before starting CO_2 capture from fossil power plants whereas investments in radioactive waste repositories can be postponed for decades after the waste emerges from nuclear power reactors. The investment costs are significant and mid-course corrections are expensive; hence, both technologies need stable regulatory systems.",2011-01-01,10.1007/978-90-481-8712-6_8,"['Toth, Ferenc L.', 'Miketa, Asami']",Geological Disposal of Carbon Dioxide and Radioactive Waste: A Comparative Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-90-481-8712-6_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

In particular, we focus on the importance of technology-specific versus technology-neutral environmental regulations in the project host regions. We also consider alternative CDM benefit-sharing arrangements between the host and client regions. An analytical impure-public-good model is developed which considers CDM projects as a conditional transfer exerting price and income effects. These, in turn, induce changes in the use of environmental technologies, and with it global and local environmental protection levels. Aided by model simulations using empirical data for China and the European Union, we seek to assess conditions in which CDM transfers are more favourable towards improved environmental protection and welfare in developing regions.",2010-09-01,10.1007/s10290-010-0063-9,"['Rive, Nathan', 'Rübbelke, Dirk T.

93,Meeting World Growing Energy Needs the Role of Nuclear Power,"The 21st century will face an increased population with limited resources. The latest projection of the United Nations estimates an additional 1.65 billion people by 2030. The rising population should access to all modern services and welfare. Resources demand is expected to increase dramatically in the 21st century, especially in developing countries, where population growth is fast and billions of people nowadays have no access to these services. If no new, strong energy-policy interventions occur, the world’s energy needs will be well over 50% higher in 2030 than today. Fossil fuels will continue to dominate world fuel mix (IEA, International Energy Agency, in World energy outlook 2007, Paris, 2008 ). The consequent growth in energy-related emissions of carbon-dioxide is noteworthy. The challenge is to reach an energy system allowing this growth and assuring security, reliability, and environmental protection. With worldwide demand for energy expected to more than double by 2030, the need for safe, clean, reliable energy is essential. Much of greenhouse gasses emissions is due to the energy sector. Energy supply, generation and use (and its environmental consequences) is definitely the issue of our times and the coming. All technologies may be complimentary for fitting the demand. Known means exist to cut energy demand and change the fuel mix. In this paper, we will introduce the energy issue and show which role nuclear energy could have in reducing emissions.",2010-06-01,10.1007/s11300-010-0146-2,"['Bonavigo, Lucia']",Transition Studies Review,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11300-010-0146-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
94,Cost Effective and Environmentally Safe Emission Trading Under Uncertainty,"The aim of this paper is to analyze robust cost-effective and environmentally safe carbon emission trading schemes under uncertainties of emissions and costs, and asymmetric information of participants. The proposed model allows to control explicitly the safety of Kyoto (or other) targets by taking long-term perspectives on emission trading. The dynamics of this scheme is driven by bilateral trades with different endogenous disequilibrium prices between mutually beneficial trades, but finally the system converges to cost-effective and environmentally safe global equilibrium. The safety constraints work as a discounting mechanism that discounts the reported emissions to detectable undershooting levels. This, in turn, provides incentives for participants to reduce uncertainties. The model shows that uncertainties and short term market perspectives may easily prevent price-based trading to be environmentally safe and cost-effective scheme. The desirable equilibrium emerges only under proper price-formation mechanisms. The role of the proposed computerized multi-agent trading system is central for dealing with long-term perspectives, irreversibility and lock-in equilibriums of trades. This system can be viewed as a device for decentralized collective regulation of trades based on unified approaches to modeling of uncertainty, calculation of costs and trading rules.",2010-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-03735-1_5,"['Ermolieva, T.', 'Ermoliev, Y.', 'Fischer, G.', 'Jonas, M.', 'Makowski, M.']",Coping with Uncertainty,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-03735-1_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
95,Permit Trading and Credit Trading: A Comparison of Cap-Based and Rate-Based Emissions Trading Under Perfect and Imperfect Competition,"This paper compares emissions trading based on a cap on total emissions (permit trading) and on relative standards per unit of output (credit trading). Two types of market structure are considered: perfect competition and Cournot oligopoly. We find that output, abatement costs and the number of firms are higher under credit trading. Allowing trade between permit-trading and credit-trading sectors may increase welfare. With perfect competition, permit trading always leads to higher welfare than credit trading. With imperfect competition, credit trading may outperform permit trading. Environmental policy can lead to exit, but also to entry of firms. Entry and exit have a profound impact on the performance of the schemes, especially under imperfect competition. We find that it may be impossible to implement certain levels of total industry emissions. Under credit trading several levels of the relative standard can achieve the same total level of emissions.",2009-09-01,10.1007/s10640-009-9266-8,"['Boom, Jan-Tjeerd', 'Dijkstra, Bouwe R.']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-009-9266-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

In the first publications and books of that time (e.g., International Negotiation , edited by Kremenyuk [20] and Negotiation Analysis , edited by Young [51]) the question of the relevance of formal models and quantitative approaches in regard to negotiation was carefully analyzed by several authors representing the different scientific disciplines contributing to the area.",2007-01-01,10.1007/978-3-540-68304-9_1,"['Avenhaus, Rudolf', 'Zartman, I.

97,Can the Czech Republic Participate in Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading?,"The aim of this case study is to answer the question whether in the next decade and longer term the Czech Republic can participate in greenhouse gas emission trading. We analysed the position of the Czech Republic, especially with respect to one of the most discussed international agreements in this field, the Kyoto Protocol. Carbon, which is considered here primarily as the main source of energy so that it can be discussed later as the main component of greenhouse gases, is the main ""binding material"" of all the parts of the presented paper. The study starts with the current economic and environmental situation in the Czech Republic in its first chapter. The second part focuses on the energy sector – the main source of greenhouse gas emissions – from the point of view of fossil energy sources as well as renewable energy sources. The third chapter offers a comprehensive national greenhouse gas inventory which allows us in the following chapter to make some predictions about the Czech Republic's potential for intangible carbon flows – emission permits trading. This chapter contains projections not only for the Kyoto Protocol term (2008–2012) but also for medium (2020) and longer terms (2030). Besides the emission projections the description of possible future developments in government strategy, with respect to emission trading, has been outlined in this section. Through such a procedure the main research question, whether the Czech Republic can participate in greenhouse gas emission trading in the next decade, is answered in the affirmative for the period 2008–2012 and the potential for joint implementation and emission trading is quantified. At the end of this study we also raised some broader research questions about problems connected with the future development of an emission trading system after 2012.",2003-09-01,10.1023/B:INEA.0000005627.39111.e9,"['Sejak, Josef', 'Kupka, Martin']",International Environmental Agreements,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/B:INEA.0000005627.39111.e9,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
98,Project-Based Emissions Trading: The Impact of Institutional Arrangements on Cost-Effectiveness,"In this paper we demonstrate that the institutionalarrangement (or: design) of Joint Implementation (JI) and the CleanDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) has a decisive impact on theircost-effectiveness. We illustrate our arguments by statistically analyzing thecosts from 94 Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) pilot phase projects aswell as by adjusting these data on the basis of simple mathematicalformulas. These calculations explicitly take into account the institutionaldifferences between JI (sinks, no banking) and the CDM (banking, no sinks)under the Kyoto Protocol and also show the possible effects on credit costsof alternative design options. However, our numerical illustrations shouldbe viewed with caution, because AIJ is only to a limited extentrepresentative of potential future JI and CDM projects and because creditcosts are not credit prices. Some of the main figures found in this study are:an average cost figure per unit of emission reduction for AIJ projects of 46dollar per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent ($/Mg CO_2-eq), anaverage potential JI credit cost figure which is lowered to 37$/Mg CO_2-eq by introducing banking and an average of 6$/Mg CO_2-eq per credit for potential low-cost CDM projects whichincludes sinks. However, at CoP6 in November 2000 in The Hague (TheNetherlands), the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change(FCCC) did not (yet) reach consensus on the institutional details of theproject-based mechanisms, such as the possible arrangement of early JIaction or the inclusion of sinks under the CDM.",2001-06-01,10.1023/A:1011330609725,"['Woerdman, Edwin', 'van der Gaast, Wytze']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1011330609725,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer

100,The Role of EU Internal Policies in Implementing Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Options to Achieve Kyoto Targets,"This paper reviews the role of internal European Union (EU) policies and measures in implementing the target for greenhouse gas mitigation in the Kyoto Protocol. It starts with a discussion of the EU Burden Sharing Agreement, which distributes the target between Member States. This leads to a review of the appropriate level of implementation of policies, i.e. at the EU level or Member State level. There is a role for the flexible mechanisms of the Protocol, particularly emission permit trading, in complementing Member State policies at the EU level. The implementation is to be done against the background of three major factors which may have an important bearing on the policies: • the probable long-term requirement of substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions • a changing structure of energy markets, following liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets • EU enlargement to include economies in transition with the potential for further substantial reductions in emissions. The paper concludes with a discussion of ancillary benefits of the policies that may be substantial and a summary of the position as regards the ""unfinished business"" of the Protocol to be discussed at the Conference of the Parties in the Hague in November 2000.",2001-04-01,10.1023/A:1010133423451,"['Barker, Terry', 'Kram, Tom', 'Oberthür, Sebastian', 'Voogt, Monique']",International Environmental Agreements,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1010133423451,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
101,Electricity and emission-permits trade as a means of curbing CO_2 emissions in the Nordic countries,"The four Nordic countries Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway have fully integrated electricity grids, implying that electricity trade hitherto has accounted for a crucial part of each country’s power balance. Electricity trade also provides cost-efficient opportunities for the Nordic countries to either jointly or separately fulfil their CO_2 obligations. Assuming the targets that were agreed upon in (the aftermath of) the Kyoto negotiations in 1997, and establishing scenarios where CO_2-emission-permits trade among the Nordic countries is allowed, it is shown that the value of emission trading is somewhat larger than the corresponding value of electricity trade. Furthermore, if both electricity and emission permits can be traded on a common Nordic market this can lead to amplified economic benefits yielding a gain that exceeds the sum of the separate values of electricity and emission permits trade. It is also shown that the additional costs of fulfilling the Kyoto protocol are small compared to the total costs of the Nordic energy system.",2000-07-01,10.1023/A:1019135900303,"['Unger, T.', 'Alm, L.']",Integrated Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1019135900303,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
102,Environmental regulation and international trade,"In this paper, we investigate how a country's choice of environmental policy instrument affects the international competitiveness of its firms. We show that in a Cournot-Nash equilibrium, the total market share of firms regulated through tradeable emission permits increases relative to that of the firms operating under command and control due to better allocation of total abatement among the firms in the country. Our work suggests that free trade situations should not only result in similar environmental standards but also in similar regulatory regimes. It may come as no surprise that the environmental authorities in Canada are seriously considering following the United States in instituting a tradeable emission permits mechanism.",1995-07-01,10.1007/BF01066600,"['Sartzetakis, Eftichios Sophocles', 'Constantatos, Christos']",Journal of Regulatory Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/BF01066600,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
103,Agency in International Pollution Permit Trading,"This chapter investigates institutional issues affecting the potential design of an international pollution permit trading program. Most previous studies, including simulation models of SO_2 emissions trading in Europe, have assumed that national governments would be the agents participating in trades. An alternative is that emission permits be distributed to and traded by affected enterprises. This chapter evaluates these two alternatives according to the two primary benefits usually attributed to incentive-based environmental policies. The first is the attainment of cost effectiveness, also referred to as technical or productive efficiency. The second is the internalization of social costs, otherwise known as allocative efficiency. I conclude that an international system of emission permit trading such as SO_2 trading in Europe, would perform better according to these economic criteria if permits were distributed directly to affected enterprises. However, in this brief investigation, such a conclusion can not be definitive. Rather, the primary finding is that further attention to the question of agency is warranted. Nevertheless, a strong case can be made that international environmental agreements such as an accord for SO_2 emissions trading in Europe should establish guidelines for national governments regarding the domestic economic regulation of internationally tradable permits.",1994-01-01,10.1007/978-94-011-1012-9_12,"['Burtraw, Dallas']",Economic Instruments for Air Pollution Control,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-011-1012-9_12,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit trade"")",springer
104,Economic Analysis of Carbon Removal Strategy by Fusion–Biomass Hybrid System in the Future Market Mechanism,"Since the low-carbon technology fusion energy is scheduled to be commercialized beyond 2050, the late-mover needs to flexibly and strategically operate for sustainable cash flow responding to the future market mechanism. Carbon sequestration of the fusion–biomass hybrid system by using low-temperature heat is proposed under the two preconditions: the establishment of the deregulated electricity market, and the emission trading market. When the price is above the breakeven price, the hybrid system generates electricity; otherwise, charcoal production is performed. Charcoal production is a stable solid form of carbon capture, and can possibly be traded on the emission credit market to secure profit. The experimental result shows that it is possible to produce charcoal at low temperature of 280 °C, indicating that any type of blanket design is applicable in the hybrid system concept. The carbon sequestration cost is 39 $/tCO_2 at the default parameter of net electric output of 4000 $/kW_e for the fusion power plant, and 60% of charcoal yield from experimental result. Comparison between the hybrid system and the fusion power plant proves that the fusion–biomass hybrid system prevents further loss, by setting two-track income structures in the various market mechanisms.",2020-04-01,10.1007/s10894-019-00229-1,"['Nam, Hoseok', 'Mukai, Keisuke', 'Yagi, Juro', 'Konishi, Satoshi']",Journal of Fusion Energy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10894-019-00229-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit trade"")",springer
105,Excess Burden of Taxation and Environmental Policy Mix with a Consumer-Friendly Firm,"This study examines the environmental policy mix of tradable emission permits and emission taxes in a duopoly model with a consumer-friendly firm. We analyse the interplay of the two policies and the welfare consequences in the presence of excess burden of taxation. We show that an emission tax can be redundant when both the excess burden of taxation and the degree of consumer friendliness are insignificant. However, when the excess burden of taxation is significant, tradable permits policy with tax treatment should be applied to enhance welfare in the presence of a consumer-friendly firm. Finally, under the tax revenue-neutral case where the excess burden of taxation does not matter, the environmental policy mix is also efficient if the degree of consumer friendliness is sufficiently high.",2019-12-01,10.1111/jere.12221,"['Leal, Mariel', 'Garcia, Arturo', 'Lee, Sang-Ho']",The Japanese Economic Review,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1111/jere.12221,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit trade"")",springer
106,Labor Market Distortions and Welfare-Decreasing International Emissions Trading,"Using a multi-region, multi-sector computable general equilibrium model, this paper analyzes the effects of international emissions trading (IET) with a focus on labor market distortions. We construct four separate models with several different labor market specifications: (1) a model without labor market distortions; (2) a model with taxinteraction effects in the labor market; (3) a model with a minimum wage; and (4) a model in which a wage curve determines wages. We use these models to analyze how the effects of IET change according to model specification. The main results from the analysis are as follows. First, we found that IET generates gains for all participants in the model without labor market distortions. Second, even in the models with labor market distortions, importers of emissions permits are highly likely to benefit. Conversely, we show that the possibility of a welfare loss from IET is not as small for exporters of permits. In particular, in the minimum wage and wage curve models, we found that the exporters of emissions permits are likely to be disadvantaged. However, this also depends on the region in question. For example, China is likely to suffer under IET, whereas Russia is likely to benefit. Finally, if we implement policies to alleviate labor market distortion simultaneously with emissions regulation, all regions receive benefit from IET.",2019-09-15,10.1007/s10640-018-00317-4,"['Takeda, Shiro', 'Arimura, Toshi H.', 'Sugino, Makoto']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-018-00317-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit trade"")",springer
107,Multi-stage emissions management of a steel company,"We present a multi-stage model for determining the optimal production and emissions coverage for an industrial company participating in the European Emissions Trading System. This model is adapted for a real-life European steel company. A mean-multiperiod CVaR is used as a decision criterion. There are two stochastic parameters—market demand for products and emissions allowance price. The aim of this paper is to explore the costs and risk of a company caused by emissions trading. The presented model is solved for various values of the risk aversion parameters and initial price of the allowance. As a result, it is found that the production is little influenced by the price of allowances and it nearly does not depend on risk-aversion. The probability of the company’s default, on the other hand, is significantly influenced by the emission prices. Futures on allowances as well as banking (i.e., transferring allowances between periods) are used to reduce the risks of the emissions trading. We further exploit the same situation under different settings, namely, given random price margins, and time-dependent, deterministic and positively contaminated distributions of demand. In all these cases, the results follow patterns similar to those given the original setting.",2019-03-12,10.1007/s10479-019-03192-4,"['Zapletal, František', 'Šmíd, Martin', 'Kopa, Miloš']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-019-03192-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit trade"")",springer

111,Interval joint-probabilistic chance-constrained programming with two-side multi-randomness: an application to energy-environment systems management,"Regional energy-environment systems management become more and more focused on greenhouse gas emission control through improving energy efficiency and efficiently managing energy activities. Inexact linear programming models are developed for supporting the management. Due to the weather/climatic variations in the future, electricity demands and renewable power generations (in the right/left hand sides of constraints) have random characteristics. Moreover, an overall satisfactory level needs to be quantified based on multiple chance constraints. Therefore, this study improved upon traditional chance-constrained programming and interval linear programming, and developed an interval joint-probabilistic two-side chance-constrained programming (IJTCP) approach. A sufficient but non-equivalent linearization form of the model was proposed so that the inexact model could be solved through the two-step solution algorithm.

112,Metropolitan size and the impacts of telecommuting on personal travel,"Telecommuting has been proposed by policy makers as a strategy to reduce travel and emissions. In studying the metropolitan size impact of telecommuting on personal travel, this paper addresses two questions: (1) whether telecommuting is consistently a substitute or complement to travel across different MSA sizes; and (2) whether the impact of telecommuting is higher in larger MSAs where telecommuting programs and policies have been more widely adopted. Data from the 2001 and 2009 National Household Travel Surveys are used. Through a series of tests that address two possible empirical biases, we find that telecommuting consistently had a complementary effect on one-way commute trips, daily total work trips and daily total non-work trips across different MSA sizes in both 2001 and 2009. The findings suggest that policies that promote telecommuting may indeed increase, rather than decrease, people’s travel demand, regardless of the size of the MSA. This seems to contradict what telecommuting policies are designed for. In addition, model results show that the complementary impact of telecommuting on daily travel is lower in larger MSAs, in terms of both daily total work trips and daily total non-work trips.",2018-03-01,10.1007/s11116-017-9846-3,"['Zhu, Pengyu', 'Wang, Liping', 'Jiang, Yanpeng', 'Zhou, Jiangping']",Transportation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11116-017-9846-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit trade"")",springer

This research focuses on some product supply chain to make a literature review-based investigation on proposing a theoretical framework. We also solve potential research issues of how diverse carbon emission regulations can work on supply chain performance as well as emission; in what way we can find coordination mechanisms and optimal policies for supply chain operations to abate emission and enhance system profitability within different scenarios; and also to evaluate the effect on emission reduction for each emission regulation aforementioned through comparing their associated supply chain performances and system emission. Both practitioners in industry and academia might find this study useful, as it generates concepts with a formal framework of potential and values theoretical issues in the emerging field of carbon-efficient supply chain management which combines carbon emission regulations with mature operation management to enrich the theory of supply chain management. This study is perhaps to be valuable and constructive both for operational decisions in firms and for the enactment as well as implementation of emission-reduction regulations.

119,Development of a Novel Flash Ironmaking Technology with Greatly Reduced Energy Consumption and CO_2 Emissions,"Despite the dominance of the blast furnace ironmaking process, increasing attention is being paid to the development of new technologies with lower energy consumption and CO_2 emissions. At the University of Utah, a novel flash ironmaking technology to meet these demands is under development. This technology eliminates the highly problematic cokemaking and pelletization/sintering steps by directly utilizing iron ore concentrate, which is currently produced in large quantities in North America and elsewhere. This transformative technology is expected to allow significant energy saving and reduced CO_2 emissions compared with the blast furnace process. It has been demonstrated that iron of more than 95 % metallization can be obtained by reduction with hydrogen or a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in 2–7 s at temperatures of 1473–1823 K.

124,Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility for Spirituality and Sustainability,"Sustainable development and ecosystem management commonly involve tough sociopolitical choices and often face a conflict between economic benefits and environmental degradation. This calls for stewardship from both corporate and public policy leaders to protect and preserve our only planet for future generations. People are inherently self-serving. Absent purpose as a moderator, one could easily skew the objective through the inherent bias of self or inner group interest. In the sustainability/environmental arena, unethical behavior often manifests itself in the form of—caring only for people who mimic us, protecting only parts of the eco-system that overtly serve us and of course generating profits only for a subsection of the stakeholders. In this chapter, the authors focus on environmental ethics within sustainability and expand the triple bottom-line context of people, planet, and profit with a fourth component—purpose—to emphasize the power of ethics as a balancing force to preempt the disastrous pitfalls of economics without ethics. ‘Carbon-share’ is introduced in the context of climate change and intergenerational equity, and a red flag raised that “Carbon-share could become the most contentious distributive justice issue globally.” The chapter also highlights the crucial roles of corporate social responsibility and public policy stewardship, presents a framework for ethical decision making, and illustrates how an environmental ethics dilemma is resolved with a case study.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-34235-1_5,"['Ramanan, Raghavan (Ram)', 'Taback, Harold (Hal)']",Spirituality and Sustainability,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-34235-1_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit trade"")",springer
125,DMSP-IEES: A Stochastic Programming Model Based on Dual-Interval and Multi-Stage Scenarios Modeling Approaches for Energy Systems Management and GHG Emissions Control,"Energy-related activities contribute a major portion of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere. In this study, a dual-interval multi-stage stochastic programming model for the planning of integrated energy-environment systems (DMSP-IEES) model is developed for integrated energy-environment systems management, in which issues of GHG-emission mitigation can be reflected throughout the process of energy systems planning. By integrating methodologies of interval linear programming (when numbers are described as interval values without distribution information), dual-interval programming (when lower and upper bounds of interval values are not available as deterministic values but as discrete intervals), and multi-stage stochastic programming, the DMSP-IEES model is capable of dealing with uncertainties expressed as discrete intervals, dual intervals, and probability distributions within a multi-stage context. Decision alternatives can also be generated through analysis of the single- and dual-interval solutions according to projected applicable conditions. A case study is provided for demonstrating the applicability of the developed methodology. The results indicate that the developed model can tackle the dual uncertainties and the dynamic complexities in the energy-environment management systems through a multi-layer scenario tree. In addition, it can reflect the interactions among multiple system components and the associated trade-offs.",2014-10-01,10.1007/s10666-014-9403-9,"['Li, G. C.', 'Huang, G. H.', 'Liu, Z.

126,Experimental comparison between markets on dynamic permit trading and investment in irreversible abatement with and without non-regulated companies,"This paper examines the investment strategies of compliance companies in irreversible abatement technologies and the environmental achievements of the system in an inter-temporal cap-and-trade market using laboratory experiments. The experimental analysis is performed under varying market structures: firstly, in a market that is exclusive to compliance companies and subsequently, in a market that is open to both compliance and non-compliance entities. In line with theoretical models on irreversible abatement investment, the paper shows that regulated companies trade permits at a premium. Also, steep per unit penalties for excess emissions prompt early investments in irreversible abatement technologies. Further, the paper shows that by contributing to the permit demand and supply, non-compliance companies (i) enhance the exchange of permits, helping the system to achieve a zero-excess permit position, (ii) increase the price levels, but has no apparent effect on price variability.",2014-08-01,10.1007/s11149-013-9238-3,"['Taschini, Luca', 'Chesney, Marc', 'Wang, Mei']",Journal of Regulatory Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11149-013-9238-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit trade"")",springer

130,Estimation of the impact of oil palm plantation establishment on greenhouse gas balance,"Estimates of emissions indicate that if tropical grassland is rehabilitated by oil palm plantations, carbon fixation in plantation biomass and soil organic matter not only neutralises emissions caused by grassland conversion, but also results in the net removal of about 135 Mg carbon dioxide per hectare from the atmosphere. In contrast, the emission from forest conversion clearly exceeds the potential carbon fixation of oil palm plantings. Forest conversion on mineral soils to promote continued oil palm mono cropping causes a net release of approximately 650 Mg carbon dioxide equivalents per hectare, while the emission from peat forest conversion is even higher due to the decomposition of drained peat and the resulting emission of carbon oxide and nitrous oxide. The conversion of one hectare of forest on peat releases over 1,300 Mg carbon dioxide equivalents during the first 25-year cycle of oil palm growth. Depending on the peat depth, continuous decomposition augments the emission with each additional cycle at a magnitude of 800 Mg carbon dioxide equivalents per hectare. The creation of ‘flexibility mechanisms’ such as the clean development mechanism and emission trading in the Kyoto Protocol could incorporate plantations as carbon sinks in the effort to meet emission targets. Thus, for the oil palm industry, grassland rehabilitation is an option to preserve natural forest, avoid emissions and, if the sequestered carbon becomes tradable, an opportunity to generate additional revenue.",2008-12-01,10.1007/s10668-006-9080-1,"['Germer, J.', 'Sauerborn, J.']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-006-9080-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit trade"")",springer
131,Trading biomass or GHG emission credits?,"Global biomass potentials are considerable but unequally distributed over the world. Countries with Kyoto targets could import biomass to substitute for fossil fuels or invest in bio-energy projects in the country of biomass origin and buy the credits (Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI)). This study analyzes which of those options is optimal for transportation fuels and looks for the key variables that influence the result. In two case studies (Mozambique and Brazil), the two trading systems are compared for the amount of credits generated, land-use and associated costs. We found costs of 17–30 euro per ton of carbon for the Brazilian case and economic benefits of 11 to 60 euros per ton of carbon avoided in the Mozambique case. The impact of carbon changes related to direct land-use changes was found to be very significant (both positive and negative) and can currently only be included in emission credit trading, which can largely influence the results. In order to avoid indirect land-use changes (leakage) and consequent GHG emissions, it is crucial that bioenergy crop production is done in balance with improvements of management of agriculture and livestock management. Whatever trading option is economically most attractive depends mainly on the emission baseline in the exporting (emission credit trading) or importing (physical trading) country since both bio- and fossil fuel prices are world market prices in large scale trading systems where transportation costs are low. Physical trading could be preferential since besides the GHG reduction one could also benefit from the energy. It could also generate considerable income sources for exporting countries. This study could contribute to the development of a methodology to deal with bio fuels for transport, in Emission Trading (ET), CDM and the certification of traded bio fuels.",2008-11-27,10.1007/s10584-008-9517-7,"['Laurijssen, Jobien', 'Faaij, André P.

The results show that the US withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol leads to no real emission reduction in all remaining Annex 1 regions.

138,Market Darwinism vs. Market Creationism: Adaptability and Fairness in the Design of Greenhouse Gas Trading Mechanisms,"International rule-making and compliance routines with respect to the Kyoto Protocol are evolving rapidly. This paper examines potential designs of emissions-trading programs by comparing the emissions credit trading (ECT) and cap-and-trade models for achieving cost-effective reductions in atmospheric greenhouse-gas (GHG) loading in terms of their adaptability and fairness. Adaptability is a valuable attribute when markets and their governing institutions are evolving rapidly or when regulated entities do not yet have well-established and predictable compliance routines. Fairness in both procedures and outcomes is central to efforts to establish and maintain institutions of international governance. The key difference concerns the awarding of tradable emission rights, which occurs at the launch of a cap-and-trade program but following when firms reduce emissions below baselines in an ECT scheme. Implications of this difference are explored in terms of institutional adaptability and fairness during program-design stages. By not locking in emission rights at the outset, and by being amenable to incremental roll-out, ECT appears to have superior adaptive and fairness qualities during periods of rapid institutional evolution.",2001-12-01,10.1023/A:1013330417973,"['Haddad, Brent M.', 'Palmisano, John']",International Environmental Agreements,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1013330417973,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit trade"")",springer
139,Do Painless Environmental Policies Exist?,"This paper reports an experimental test of the Porter Hypothesis that environmental regulations create innovation offsets that would not otherwise be undertaken. Using a process analysis framework to consistently account for non-separabilities in production and pollution abatement practices, the findings suggest productivity gains can appear to be greater with environmental regulations than without even though they are not. This result which would seem to support the Porter argument, is the result of inadequacies in the methods used to decompose the influences to productivity change. Thus, the experiments offer one explanation for why it has been difficult in practice to reject the hypothesis.",2000-07-01,10.1023/A:1026569410780,"['Smith, V.

140,Environmental Technological Innovation and Diffusion: Model Analysis,"This paper analyses the role of technological innovation and diffusion to control and reduce polluting emissions. First, the main effects of environmental innovation on growth and emissions are highlighted. Then, the incentives for firms to undertake R&D and carry out innovation are reviewed. Market imperfections and externalities imply that public innovation policies are necessary to supplement firms’ investments in environmental innovation. Hence, the paper discusses how R&D and innovation are linked to environmental policies, analyses how optimal policy-mixes can be designed, and focuses on the impact of related externalities on technological diffusion, crowding-out and endogenous growth. Given the international dimension of many environmental problems, the paper also discusses the impact of environmental innovation on the geographic distribution of polluting industries and of environmental policies on the international dissemination of innovation. The first part of the paper is devoted to theoretical models, whereas the second part provides a survey of empirical attempts to model environmental technological innovation and diffusion.",2000-01-01,10.1007/978-3-662-12069-9_13,"['Carraro, Carlo']",Innovation-Oriented Environmental Regulation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-662-12069-9_13,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit trade"")",springer
141,Tradeable Pollution Permits,"In Chapter 4 we looked at pollution taxes as a potentially least-cost means of achieving a desired reduction in pollution. In this chapter an alternative approach is considered, that of tradeable pollution permits (TPPs). This idea, which originated with Crocker (1966) and Dales (1968), has gained much popularity recently with environmental economists. However, as we will see, TPPs have their own set of problems. In this chapter the basic theory of TPPs is first set out, for uniformly and non-uniformly mixed pollutants. We then consider some current research issues in the area of TPPs. A concluding section examines the use of TPPs in practice, and we also ask why more use has not been made of economic instruments including both TPPs and the pollution taxes described in Chapter 4 .",1997-01-01,10.1007/978-1-349-24851-3_5,"['Hanley, Nick', 'Shogren, Jason F.', 'White, Ben']",Environmental Economics in Theory and Practice,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-349-24851-3_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit trade"")",springer
142,How Should An Accumulative Toxic Substance be Banned?,"The harmful effects on human health or ecosystems of many toxic substances depend on their cumulative concentration in the carrying medium (water, soil, or air), not just on the annual deposition rates of the substances. Accumulative toxic substances pose challenges to regulatory policy that are not faced when controlling pollutants whose damaging effects are thought to depend primarily on annual emission flows. An increasingly common response is to phase out offending uses or production of the substance. In this paper we take as given the goal of phasing out an accumulative pollutant and examine different ways this could be done using a simple, partial-equilibrium dynamic model. We focus on phaseout measures in which the cumulative production and release of the offending substance over the transition period is fixed. Once this cumulative volume is reached, users must convert to a known but higher-cost substitute that is assumed to be benign. The key to the analysis is the observation that the quota on cumulative production makes production of the toxic substance during the transition analogous to extraction of an exhaustible resource with a higher-cost, nonexhaustible ‘backstop’ technology. Using this framework, we first describe the cost-effective outcome when the ‘sunset’ date is chosen to maximize product market surplus subject to the cumulative production constraint. This outcome is compared to one in which the regulator fixes the sunset date, and one in which the regulator limits annual production as well as cumulative production out of concern for acute exposure effects. Finally, we discuss the kinds of market-based policy instruments that would be appropriate for supporting a cost-effective outcome.",1997-01-01,10.1023/A:1026447824115,"['Toman, Michael', 'Palmer, Karen']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1026447824115,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit trade"")",springer

144,Environmental regulation and international trade,"In this paper, we investigate how a country's choice of environmental policy instrument affects the international competitiveness of its firms. We show that in a Cournot-Nash equilibrium, the total market share of firms regulated through tradeable emission permits increases relative to that of the firms operating under command and control due to better allocation of total abatement among the firms in the country. Our work suggests that free trade situations should not only result in similar environmental standards but also in similar regulatory regimes.

145,Agency in International Pollution Permit Trading,"This chapter investigates institutional issues affecting the potential design of an international pollution permit trading program. Most previous studies, including simulation models of SO_2 emissions trading in Europe, have assumed that national governments would be the agents participating in trades. An alternative is that emission permits be distributed to and traded by affected enterprises. This chapter evaluates these two alternatives according to the two primary benefits usually attributed to incentive-based environmental policies. The first is the attainment of cost effectiveness, also referred to as technical or productive efficiency. The second is the internalization of social costs, otherwise known as allocative efficiency. I conclude that an international system of emission permit trading such as SO_2 trading in Europe, would perform better according to these economic criteria if permits were distributed directly to affected enterprises. However, in this brief investigation, such a conclusion can not be definitive. Rather, the primary finding is that further attention to the question of agency is warranted. Nevertheless, a strong case can be made that international environmental agreements such as an accord for SO_2 emissions trading in Europe should establish guidelines for national governments regarding the domestic economic regulation of internationally tradable permits.",1994-01-01,10.1007/978-94-011-1012-9_12,"['Burtraw, Dallas']",Economic Instruments for Air Pollution Control,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-011-1012-9_12,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit trade"")",springer
146,Supply Chain Routing in a Diary Industry Using Heterogeneous Fleet System: Simulation-Based Approach,"In this paper, an attempt is made to study and improve the transportation facilities of a milk industry using a simulation model developed using Arena. The objective of the proposed simulation model is to demonstrate the optimality of the type of truck that needs to be utilized while transporting the milk keeping into mind the sustainable factors such as environmental and social factors. The case study data have been collected from eight different villages for the quantity of milk supplied and the transportation time from these villages to the respective bulk milk coolers. Based on the data transportation, time histograms are plotted. From these histograms, the goodness of fit line representing the probability distribution curve for all different areas was identified. An Arena-based simulation model was developed for optimization and comparison with the current model. From the findings of the research, it is concluded that the optimized heterogeneous fleet supply chain model is more suitable for the dairy industry, as it is more economically viable and environmentally friendly.

147,Does waste energy usage mitigate the CO_2 emissions? A time-frequency domain analysis,"There exist many seminal studies in the literature searching the influences of total renewable usage (or usage of its some components) on CO_2 emissions. However, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a research work in the literature considering the co-movements between waste energy consumption and CO_2 emissions. This paper aims at observing the possible negative or positive impacts of waste energy consumption on environmental quality (in terms of CO_2) by monitoring the whole sample period and all subsample periods in the USA for the monthly period 1980:1–2018:12. This paper searches also the positive or negative lead-lag relations between waste and CO_2 emissions, if exist, by considering high frequency (1–3-year cycle) and low frequency (3–8-year cycle) of the same sample period and subsample periods. The findings obtained by this research in general might underline (a) the outcome indicating that waste energy usage has been effective in diminishing the carbon emissions after the second half of the 2010s in the USA and (b) the energy policy act(s) in the USA implemented which eventually resulted in lower CO_2 emissions in the USA especially after the second half of the 2000s.

148,Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions from Solid Waste Management: Prognosis of Related Issues,"The implementation of cleaner waste treatment technologies in developing countries is accompanied by myriads of limitations and obstacles. This study reports that greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions that would not have happened with business-as-usual scenarios are achievable in the waste management system under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The grounds for CDM failures and successes were reviewed by reflecting on the past and current episodes in developing countries. It was found that economic development was directly proportional to increase in waste generation rate and influenced waste composition. The need to decouple waste production from Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and linking the prevalence of more low-carbon emissions waste treatment options were found essential to ensure sustainable development and mitigate climate change. Based on the present evaluation, Brazil and Thailand have had the largest number of CDM projects and mostly small-scale projects with the highest maximum emission reductions in Brazil (751, 148 Mt CO_2e) followed by Vietnam (158, 727 Mt CO_2e) and India (158, 077 Mt CO_2e). It was found that small-scale projects were more feasible as technology transfer and financial status were hindering the implementation of large-scale CDM projects. Moreover, emissions trading through CDM were accompanied by technical obstructions in terms of carbon leakage, permit allowances and unfair carbon price with irregular international policies and regulations to control GHGs. This study highlights the potential of a carbon trading scheme through CDM waste management projects designed to aid highly polluting developed countries achieve their target baselines for carbon emissions. The increasing GHG emissions in developing and least developed countries could be tackled at the early stages of economic growth through financial and technological assistance from industrialized countries.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-63612-2_22,"['Leelah, Sunjaya', 'Mudhoo, Ackmez']","The Nexus: Energy, Environment and Climate Change",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-63612-2_22,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions carbon trade"")",springer
149,"Mapping agricultural wetlands in the Sacramento Valley, USA with satellite remote sensing","Information on rice paddy practices and rice habitat is required by decision makers and monitoring protocol to manage the agricultural wetlands of the Sacramento Valley, California. Satellite remote sensing imagery have been able to support these needs with accurate maps of rice extent and delineation of winter flooding. However, delineation of rice and habitat, paddy hydroperiod, and spatiotemporal dynamics have not been thoroughly carried out in the region. The objective of this research application was to evaluate cost-efficient synthetic aperture radar and optical imagery for mapping agricultural wetlands and hydroperiod management. Ground-truth field data from the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District was used to test a suite of remote sensing indices to differentiate among agricultural wetland types and irrigation practices. A Classification And Regression Tree approach that utilized the random forest algorithm was built to map the agricultural wetlands of the Sacramento Valley. Results show optical indices sensitive to vegetative development and surface water (Landsat NDVI and LSWI) along with Synthetic Aperture Radar backscatter values (PALSAR HH sigma nought σ° dB) were the most useful for mapping hydroperiod across habitats. Overpass timing and irrigation management were key factors in sensor and index selection. Nearly 93 % (185,494 ha) of rice paddies in the Valley underwent wet seeding practices and half (90,168 ha) of actively cultivated rice area was flooded during the winter. Eight percent (16,420 ha) of rice habitat received at least one irrigation application during the crop season. The most challenging habitat types to separate were fallow rice paddies that underwent different frequencies of inundation management due to permitting policies and duck habitat promotion. Overall, the results emphasize the utility of satellite remote sensing for rice decision making and as cost-effective tools for supporting Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification protocol.",2015-02-01,10.1007/s11273-014-9342-x,"['Torbick, Nathan', 'Salas, William']",Wetlands Ecology and Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11273-014-9342-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions carbon trade"")",springer

Additionally, exploiting exponential random graph models, we studied a large range of attributes—economic, social and environmental—that are able to explain the edges found between countries.

157,Carbon Pricing Efficacy: Cross-Country Evidence,"To date there has been an absence of cross-country empirical studies on the efficacy of carbon pricing. In this paper we present estimates of the contribution of carbon pricing to reducing national carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions from fuel combustion, using several econometric modelling approaches that control for other key policies and for structural factors that are relevant for emissions. We use data for 142 countries over a period of two decades, 43 of which had a carbon price in place at the national level or below by the end of the study period. We find evidence that the average annual growth rate of CO_2 emissions from fuel combustion has been around 2 percentage points lower in countries that have had a carbon price compared to countries without. An additional euro per tonne of CO_2 in carbon price is associated with a reduction in the subsequent annual emissions growth rate of approximately 0.3 percentage points, all else equal. While it is impossible to fully control for all relevant influences on emissions growth, our estimates suggest that the emissions trajectories of countries with and without carbon prices tend to diverge over time.",2020-06-19,10.1007/s10640-020-00436-x,"['Best, Rohan', 'Burke, Paul J.', 'Jotzo, Frank']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-020-00436-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
158,Understanding the economic impact of interacting carbon pricing and renewable energy policy in China,"Climate change is posing risks for human and natural systems, and one of the most important questions faced by policy makers is to reduce such risks and impacts through adaption and mitigation actions. As the country with the highest CO_2 emissions, China is facing unprecedented challenges: climate change, energy structure transformation and socio-economic development all pose complex dilemmas for policy makers. The Chinese government has introduced energy policy and emission reduction measures to achieve its climate change mitigation targets. However, overlap between these measures may generate great uncertainty about their performance. By using a multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this study examines the economic impacts of implementing a nationwide carbon market and a renewable energy subsidy in the power sector in China. The study finds that a renewable energy policy would increase the economic cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and lead to a lower carbon price level if a carbon pricing mechanism were in place. However, the combination of the two policies indeed shows advantages in achieving emission reduction targets and renewable energy promotion targets. While an emission trading scheme is necessary for reducing emissions effectively, a renewable energy policy could promote the large-scale use of renewable energy in the electricity sector. In addition, the adoption of a renewable energy policy could yield substantial inter-regional capital inflow to central and western regions. This would improve low-carbon investment in less developed regions, and thus an appropriately designed policy mix would be sensible.",2020-06-10,10.1007/s10113-020-01663-0,"['Wu, Jie', 'Fan, Ying', 'Timilsina, Govinda', 'Xia, Yan', 'Guo, Renyong']",Regional Environmental Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10113-020-01663-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
159,Leader-follower optimized approach for carbon-economy equilibrium in the municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration industry,"Municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration contributes significantly to carbon emissions, and has become a serious problem in China, which has seen an exponential rise in waste over the last twenty years due to rapid urbanization and the associated consumer economy growth. To tackle this issue, this paper develops a leader-follower optimized approach for economic and environmental equilibrium in incineration power plants that includes a carbon allowance allocation scheme (IPP-CAAS) under combustion and pollutant limitations. In the leader-follower (bi-level) game, the regional authority on the upper level determines the carbon allocations and environmental targets and the IPPs on the lower level develop schemes to maximize revenue under the upper-level restrictions. By employing uncertain parameters for the carbon and power conversion fluctuations, the approach is able to more accurately depict the industry characteristics of waste incineration process in this carbon-economy balance problem. The robustness and practicality of the proposed methodology was then validated through a case study. Scenario analysis under different political parameters indicates that the proposed methodology can assist the authorities to achieve carbon-economy trade-off and under serious carbon-control situations, encourage the IPPs to reduce their blended coal ratios, and invest in low-carbon incineration technology. Managerial insights on further industrial developments are also given for the authority and relevant practitioners.",2020-06-08,10.1007/s11356-020-09076-6,"['Xu, Jiuping', 'Zhu, Mengyuan', 'Zhao, Siwei']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-09076-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
160,Disaggregating the dependent variable in policy feedback research: an analysis of the EU Emissions Trading System,"The literature on policy dynamics has long argued for a better conceptualization and measurement of the dependent variable (“policy”), but this fundamental point has often been neglected in the policy feedback literature. In this paper, we explore how far disaggregating policy into different elements (policy instruments, objectives, and settings) addresses this gap. We do so by examining the world’s largest market-based climate policy instrument—emissions trading in the European Union—and reveal a number of valuable new insights. First, even if positive policy feedback locks in a policy instrument, actor contestation does not disappear, but narrows down to the more detailed level of policy settings. Second, feedback may operate differently at each policy level: the policy instrument and its settings may strengthen at the same time as support for broader objectives weakens. Finally, positive feedback may simultaneously strengthen opposing actors’ support for multiple policy elements, leading to a form of “policy stability by stalemate.” These findings highlight the need for a new, interdisciplinary phase of policy feedback research that more fully disaggregates the dependent variable across a wider range of policy areas and policy instrument types.

161,Climate change mitigation options among farmers in South Asia,"Agriculture in South Asia is highly vulnerable to climate change due to increasing variability in rainfall and rising temperatures leading to the incidence of extreme climatic events such as floods, droughts, heat/cold waves, and storms. Agriculture sector also contributes to the causes of climate change through the emission of greenhouse gasses (GHGs). Hence, adaptation-led mitigation measures are required to sustain agricultural productivity, farm income and reduce GHG emissions wherever possible. This study presents a systematic review of agriculture emission reduction opportunities with a particular focus on agricultural production systems in South Asia. Our review indicates that the adoption of better soil, water, nutrient management practices, and technologies has enormous potential to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture, thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Many existing practices and technologies have the potential to improve both adaptation and mitigation in agriculture which can significantly contribute to complying with nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of South Asian countries. However, barriers to the adoption of GHG mitigating agricultural practices, mainly the financial and institutional barriers, need to be appropriately addressed to achieve the desired level of mitigation.",2020-04-01,10.1007/s10668-019-00345-0,"['Aryal, Jeetendra Prakash', 'Rahut, Dil Bahadur', 'Sapkota, Tek B.', 'Khurana, Ritika', 'Khatri-Chhetri, Arun']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-019-00345-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
162,"Research on the sustainable development process of low-carbon pilot cities: the case study of Guiyang, a low-carbon pilot city in south-west China","China plans to pursue low-carbon development in its low-carbon pilot cities to control greenhouse gas emissions. The low-carbon city development is an important method to achieve sustainable development strategy, while it is also a new city development mode to promote natural ecology, low-carbon economy and social happiness. However, the evaluation process of the low-carbon city is a multiple objective and decision problem. A single indicator cannot comprehensively and objectively evaluate a city’s low-carbon development level, so a comprehensive evaluation index system should be established. So taking Guiyang as a case study, this article constructs 35 evaluating indicators that are based on the basic urban development level and low-carbon urban development level to analyse the economic development, social progress and environmental quality transmutation comprehensively by using the entropy method. The results show that in the whole process of sustainable development, the economic development, social progress and the environmental quality have been greatly improved, but the low-carbon level had been on the low side from 2003 to 2016 in Guiyang. Therefore, Guiyang still has a long way to go to become a low-carbon city, and concrete policies and countermeasures should be taken to promote the low-carbon level. In particular, Guiyang has to strengthen the dual constraint of carbon emission intensity and total carbon emissions, adhere to the development path characterized by low carbon and strive to achieve leapfrog development.",2020-03-14,10.1007/s10668-020-00679-0,"['Peng, Tao', 'Deng, Hongwei']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-020-00679-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
163,A comparison of different tillage systems in irrigated conditions by risk and gross margin analysis in Erzurum region of Turkey,"The potential of tillage systems for generating environmental pollution and the economic risks of the systems are influential factors for farmers to adopt conservation tillage practices. This study was carried out between 2000 and 2008 in order to evaluate the economic and risk of different tillage and planting systems in the province of Erzurum, Turkey. Tillage treatments consist of conventional tillage [moldboard plow + disk harrow + combined harrows + precision seeder, (CT)], reduced tillage 1 [cultivator + combined harrows + precision seeder, (RT1)], reduced tillage 2 [rotary power harrow + precision seeder, (RT2)] and no-till seeding [no-till seeder, (NT)] systems which were studied. A trial field has been tilled with four different tillage systems with a crop rotation of common vetch–winter wheat–sunflower. The economic evaluation of the tillage and planting systems was made by calculating the gross margin and the risk appraisal and the standard deviation of the yield and gross margins. The conventional tillage system required the most labor, fuel, oil and variable costs. According to conventional tillage and planting system, the most cost-saving system is direct planting by NT. The highest pollutant in terms of environment was the CT system with the highest carbon dioxide release, while the NT system was the most environmentally friendly system. The order of systems from high to low, in terms of obtained gross margin, ranked a CT, RT1, RT2 and NT. The lowest variation in terms of productivity was in the NT system for all products, and the highest variation was in the RT1 system. In terms of gross margin, the lowest variation was again in the NT system. A farmer who decides on the basis of gross margin should choose the CT system with the highest average gross margin. A producer considering gross margin should decide on the NT system based on risk assessment.",2020-03-01,10.1007/s10668-019-00308-5,"['Demir, Okan', 'Gözübüyük, Zinnur']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-019-00308-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
164,A comparative analysis of Chinese regional climate regulation policy: ETS as an example,"An effective and powerful regulation is indispensable for the development and smooth operation of a cap-and-trade emission trading scheme (ETS). Seven regional pilot ETSs have been established and gradually improved in China, from which the experiences and lessons learned may provide useful references to facilitate China’s national ETS regulation. This article systematically reviews and compares the practices and policies of carbon trading regulation in China’s seven pilot schemes from three major aspects of regulatory institutions and subjects, regulatory objects and content, and regulatory means and techniques, and covering both internal and external regulatory architectures. The comparative analysis has demonstrated that the regional pilot schemes have made notable achievements in developing ETS regulatory systems with Chinese characteristics, but they still have considerable deficiencies. Referencing both international and domestic pilot experiences, this study recommends that China’s national ETS improve regulatory institutional basis, foster an extensive participation of pluralistic regulatory subjects with a clear division of powers and responsibilities, establish effective regulatory systems on carbon finance, and continuously enrich regulatory techniques and platforms.",2020-03-01,10.1007/s10653-019-00310-w,"['Jiang, Jingjing', 'Ye, Bin']",Environmental Geochemistry and Health,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10653-019-00310-w,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
165,Flaws in the interpretation phase of bioenergy LCA fuel the debate and mislead policymakers,"Purpose We hypothesize that the current heated scientific debate on bioenergy sustainability is fuelled by flaws in the interpretation phase of bioenergy LCA studies rather than by the lack of studies or shared methodologies. The interpretation phase is the key step in LCA studies, which guarantees their quality and consistency and gives meaning to the work carried out by delivering results that are consistent with the defined goal and scope, which reach conclusions, and explain limitations. Methods To test our hypothesis, we selected the 100 most cited articles found in Scopus utilizing a query to include most of the relevant works on LCA of bioenergy. The rationale underpinning the choice of the most cited articles is that these are presumably the most influential. A further screening identified off-topic articles, reviews, and methodological papers, which were discarded. We have also checked whether the articles analysed referred to the ISO standards. The study is organized as a reasoned and parametrized review in which we assess the methodological approach of the studies, rather than the results obtained. Results and discussion We find that overlooking some of the fundamental steps in the interpretation phase in bioenergy LCA is a rather common practice. Although most of the studies referred to the ISO standards, the identification of issues, their framing with sensitivity analyses, and the identification and reporting of limitations, which are all needed to comply with ISO14044 standards, are often neglected by practitioners. The most problematic part of the interpretation phase is the consistency check. In most cases, the assessment framework built is not apt at answering the question set in the goal. Limitations are properly identified and reported only in few studies. Conclusions We conclude that in many studies either the conclusions and recommendations drawn are not robust because the inventory and the impact assessment phases are not consistent with the goal of the study, or the conclusions and recommendations go well beyond what the limitations of the study would allow. In our opinion, these flaws in the interpretation phase of influential LCA studies are among the responsible factors that continue to fuel the debate around the sustainability of bioenergy. We report a set of recommendations both for LCA practitioners and for users to guide the LCA practitioners in properly organizing and reporting their work, and to facilitate the readers in understanding and evaluating the significance and applicability of the results presented.",2020-01-01,10.1007/s11367-019-01654-2,"['Agostini, Alessandro', 'Giuntoli, Jacopo', 'Marelli, Luisa', 'Amaducci, Stefano']",The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11367-019-01654-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
166,How the Energiewende Came to Be,"During the past five decades decisions to design and re-design Germany’s energy system got entangled with severe economic crises, environmental and security concerns, nuclear proliferation Nuclear proliferation threads, socio-political reforms, and geopolitical interests, steadily increasing the system’s complexity. This chapter is an attempt to grasp this complexity and to document how the Energiewende unfolded from the first thoughts about a future free of fossil and nuclear power plants up to its current proof-of-concept. I describe in it how Germany’s energy system has changed over time; identify the turning points in Germany’s energy policy, and the “contingencies Technological System Theory contingencies ”[ According to Hughes Hughes, Thomas Parke ( 1969 , 1979 , 1986 , 1987 , 1993 ) contingencies are events that can redirect and fundamentally change one system’s development path (e.g., recessions, hot and cold wars, oil crises, accidents, etc.).] that have led to significant system changes. I explain how it came to be that the Greens —a fringe movement at the beginning of the period of analysis—gathered momentum, occupied central stage, and exported their agenda to all established political parties. Finally, I review the most important rules implemented to steer Germany’s economy toward low carbon technologies, highlight some of their shortcomings, and document the nation’s continuous efforts to learn from undesired outcomes and improve these rules.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-42730-6_4,"['Sturm, Christine']",Inside the Energiewende,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-42730-6_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
167,Transition Governance and Barriers to Transition,"Despite best intentions at the top of and across government and broad citizen support from the bottom up, the Energiewende has not produced the intended results. This chapter aims to increase the understanding of potential transition governance barriers. Therefore, I identify the major “reverse salients” Germany encountered, while trying to steer its economy away from conventional fuels. The “reverse salient” concept originates in the seminal works of Hughes (1987, 1993) and refers to insufficiently developed system components that prevent the whole system from evolving in desired directions. Delays in extending the power grid and the lack of appropriate solutions for storing electricity at a large scale are both examples of “reverse salients” encountered in the Energiewende arena. Alongside with technological system components, social ones can also gridlock transition processes. Indeed, as Germany’s case shows, people protesting against the construction of power lines, windmills, or power plants can cause transition barriers. Moreover, by adopting inappropriate policies governments can also induce major “reverse salients”. Since 2000, the share of renewable energy fed into the German electricity grid steadily grew, the instruments of the Energiewende toolbox sprawled out like mushrooms after the rain, and the interactions between social and technical elements of the nation's energy system reached degrees of complexity difficult to process by a single human mind. In this chapter I address some of these complexities. Using examples from practice, I discuss problems related to the intermittent nature of wind and solar energy, and explain why energy transitions require large-scale storage technologies to be successful. I show how Energiewend e policies resulted in increasing societal burdens, describe the existential struggle of utility actors in the new regulatory context, and explain how non-governmental actors can and do misuse imperfect rules for their own profit. Finally, I assess the Energiewende outcomes and compare them to other nations’ efforts to decarbonize their energy systems.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-42730-6_5,"['Sturm, Christine']",Inside the Energiewende,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-42730-6_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
168,Decarbonization and Urban Sustainability,"Why climate change mitigation plans often fail to gain global consensus is due to geo-economic political influences. Where the question often arises of why should countries, that contribute less to climate change, made to suffer the most, and why countries that benefit economically the most from climate change, are now asking others to reduce economic activities on the basis of reducing pollution emissions. This chapter introduces the concept of regional decarbonization. It outlines how several attempts in proposing climate change mitigation plans have attracted resistance from developed economies. These negative responses have occurred even though proposed alternative models can theoretically work and often call for a systemic shift that can disrupt global economies prompting a perception that they are a threat that governments are not always apt to accommodate.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-40727-8_2,"['Allam, Zaheer', 'Jones, David', 'Thondoo, Meelan']",Cities and Climate Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-40727-8_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
169,Energy Governance in Greece,"Greece has made a significant development in the energy sector; however, the decarbonization process still lags behind. In the awaking of the economic crisis, in 2009, the country was highly dependent on lignite for electricity production, and the energy market was controlled by a monopoly of the public power corporation. In order to comply with the EU regulation, and the imposed memorandum of understanding, Greece tried to reform the energy sector by liberating the energy market through market initiatives and more concretely through privatization and liberalization. At the same time, a number of mostly incentive-based instruments have managed to reduce emissions by increasing energy efficiency and the penetration of the renewable energy sources. Nonetheless, the highly bureaucratic and complex administrative system controlled by a centralized state and the presence of strong lobbies often overshadow these efforts. In order to increase energy security, Greece is currently building two new lignite plants prolonging that way its reliance on coal. With the entrance of the country in a period of economic stability, it is important to revaluate the energy planning, design a coherent long-term climate policy, reform the energy sector, and try to overcome the various barriers in the way to energy transition.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-73526-9_12-1,"['Tsagkari, Marula']",Handbook of Energy Governance in Europe,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-73526-9_12-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
170,Norway—The World Leader in BEV Adoption,"Norway is the leading per capita BEV market in the world. The share of BEVs in the fleet exceeded 5% in December 2017 with another 2.5% being PHEVs. The market shares of BEVs and PHEVs in 2017 were 20% and 18% respectively. The total market share of BEVs and PHEVs in 2018 was well above 40% and in 2019 exceeded 50%. These vehicles have easily been adopted by Norwegian households. 4 out of 5 BEV owners, however, own another vehicle, giving them the option to swap vehicles when the range is too short. A strong incentive package has been introduced since 1990. The political targets which these incentives are intended to support have developed over the years. While these incentives were initially introduced to allow for experimentation with electric vehicles, and subsequent industrialization efforts, they are now geared towards meeting climate policy targets of reducing transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions. These incentives induced 20 years of BEV niche market experimentation and led to a fleet of 3000 BEVs by 2009. The long-term stability of BEV policies, the public awareness of BEVs created by their owners, the competences developed in the niche markets, and the strong incentive package, became a window of opportunity for the traditional passenger vehicle importers. When BEVs became available from their brands from 2010, they could import and sell them with immediate success using their vast national dealer networks.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-38382-4_6,"['Figenbaum, Erik']",Who’s Driving Electric Cars,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-38382-4_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

Results The amount of organic carbon in the Pinus densiflora forest was 261.09 ton C ha^−1 during the research period, and fixed organic carbon in plant through net photosynthesis was 3.2 ton C ha^−1 year^−1. The organic carbon in plant was 62.77 ton C ha^−1 (24.04%), in litter on the forest floor was 3.65 ton C ha^−1 (1.40%), and in soil was 194.67 ton C ha^−1 (74.56%). The value of plant, litter on forest floor, and soil organic carbon distribution were each 6,277,000 won ha^−1, 365,000 won ha^−1, and 19,467,000 won ha^−1. The value per ton of fixed organic carbon in plant through net photosynthesis was 320,000 won ha^−1 year^−1 and the value of ecosystem services stored in carbon in the Namsan forest ecosystem was about 26.1 million won ha^−1 for 3 years.

If the postponement constrains intertemporal arbitrage, short-term investments increase but long-term investments are deterred. This effect aggravates the shortage of long-term investments at least partially attributed to firms’ impatience. The cancellation of allowances agreed for Phase IV of the EU ETS is suitable to counteract the negative effects of cap-neutral postponement on long-term investments—by making the reserve redundant.

175,Transitional Restricted Linkage Between Emissions Trading Schemes,"Linkages between Emissions Trading Systems are deemed an important element of the future climate policy landscape. They are, however, difficult to agree and remain few and far between. Temporary restrictions on permit trading have potential to facilitate and gradually approach unrestricted, full linkage. We compare the relative merits of several link restrictions in this respect, namely quantitative transfer limits, border taxes on transfers, exchange and discount rates, and unilateral linkage. To this end, we develop a simple model to have a unifying framework which, in conjunction with lessons we draw from real-world experiences, serves as a basis for a broader, policy-oriented discussion. While quantitative restrictions seem to be the natural route to full linkage, they can lead to uncertain distributional effects and weaken price signals. These aspects are mitigated under a border permit tax, but this policy seems harder to implement. Exchange rates have potential to adjust for programmes’ stringencies and raise ambition over time, but can be challenging to select. As experience corroborates, unilateral linkage can be a convenient approach.",2019-09-15,10.1007/s10640-018-00307-6,"['Quemin, Simon', 'Perthuis, Christian']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-018-00307-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
176,Tackling food consumption inequality to fight hunger without pressuring the environment,"A scenario simulation to tackle hunger globally reveals that improving food availability for the under-nourished through better distribution has a better environmental performance than increasing overall food availability. Ending hunger is a Sustainable Development Goal of the UN. However, feeding a growing world population by increasing food production without implementing more sustainable consumption will threaten the environment. We explore alternative hunger eradication scenarios that do not compromise environmental protection. We find that an economy-growth-oriented scenario, which ignores inequitable food distribution and is aimed at ending hunger by increasing overall food availability, would require about 20% more food production, 48 Mha of additional agricultural land and would increase greenhouse gas emissions by 550 Mt of CO_2 equivalents yr^−1 in 2030, compared with the business-as-usual scenario. If hunger eradication efforts were focused solely on the under-nourished, food demand would increase by only 3%, and the associated environmental trade-offs would be largely reduced. Moreover, a combined scenario that targets the under-nourished while also reducing over-consumption, food waste, agricultural intensification and other environmental impacts would reduce food demand by 9% compared with the business-as-usual scenario and would lead to the multiple benefits of reducing hunger and contributing to environmental sustainability.",2019-09-01,10.1038/s41893-019-0371-6,"['Hasegawa, Tomoko', 'Havlík, Petr', 'Frank, Stefan', 'Palazzo, Amanda', 'Valin, Hugo']",Nature Sustainability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0371-6.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
177,Estimation of carbon storage in coastal wetlands and comparison of different management schemes in South Korea,"Background Organic carbon stored in coastal wetlands, which comprises the major part of oceanic “blue carbon,” is a subject of growing interest and concern. In this study, organic carbon storage in coastal wetlands and its economic value were estimated using the raw data of 25 studies related to soil carbon storage. Data were collected from three tidal flats (one protected and two developed areas) and two estuarine salt marshes (one protected and one restored area). Bulk density, soil organic matter content, and standing biomass of vegetation were all considered, with Monte Carlo simulation applied to estimate the uncertainty. Results Mean carbon storage in two salt marshes ranged between 14.6 and 25.5 kg C m^−2. Mean carbon storage in tidal flats ranged from 18.2 to 28.6 kg C m^−2, with variability possibly related to soil texture. The economic value of stored carbon was estimated by comparison with the price of carbon in the emission trading market. The value of US $6600 ha^−1 is ~ 45% of previously estimated ecosystem services from fishery production and water purification functions in coastal areas. Conclusions Although our study sites do not cover all types of large marine ecosystem, this study highlights the substantial contribution of coastal wetlands as carbon sinks and the importance of conserving these habitats to maximize their ecosystem services.",2019-03-22,10.1186/s41610-019-0106-7,"['Byun, Chaeho', 'Lee, Shi-Hoon', 'Kang, Hojeong']",Journal of Ecology and Environment,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s41610-019-0106-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
178,Evaluation and mitigation of cement CO_2 emissions: projection of emission scenarios toward 2030 in China and proposal of the roadmap to a low-carbon world by 2050,"Much attention is being paid toward reducing the carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions associated with China’s cement production. However, as part of China’s international commitment to reduce carbon intensity, the inter-annual changes and driving forces behind CO_2 emissions must be determined for the 2001–2015 period, along with the projection of the cement-related CO_2 emissions until 2030. The objective of this article is to analyze the CO_2 emission factors (EFs) and CO_2 emissions from 2001 to 2015, project CO_2 emission scenarios of China’s cement industry until 2030, and propose a low-carbon roadmap for the global cement industry by 2050 based on a series of practical reduction measurements performed by China. The results of our study indicate that CO_2 EFs in 2015 were 55.36% lower than those in 2001, but CO_2 emissions were 72.90% higher than those in 2001. The main reason for the decreasing total active CO_2 EFs are policies enacted by the Chinese government regarding the removal of excess capacity and elimination of backward capacity as well as the technological innovation and ongoing annual reductions in the clinker-to-cement ratio (C/CR). Meanwhile, the driving force behind the increased cement-related CO_2 emissions was the substantial growth in cement output. Scenarios regarding CO_2 emissions by 2030 show an uncertainty regarding CO_2 emissions, ranging between 3.51 and 11.70%, and CO_2 EFs are expected to be 59–69% lower than those in 2005. CO_2 emissions from the global cement industry from 2020 to 2050 based on CO_2 capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS); utilization of alternative raw materials (ARMs) and alternative fossil fuels (AFFs); and technological innovation account for 39.3, 29.3, 24.7, and 6.7% of the CO_2 reduction capability, respectively. It is possible to reduce ~ 1524 Mt of CO_2, and the global optimal emissions by 2050 are ~ 2082 Mt of CO_2.",2019-02-01,10.1007/s11027-018-9813-0,"['Wei, Junxiao', 'Cen, Kuang', 'Geng, Yuanbo']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-018-9813-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

A game model taking into account the heterogeneous emotions of government and individuals,"The implementation of personal carbon trading (PCT) scheme is urgently required in the context of low-carbon development. It is a key issue and a difficult problem for government to design the pattern of involving individuals into PCT scheme. Based on the rank-dependent expected utility theory, game model and numerical simulation were employed to analyse the influences of the heterogeneous emotions of government and individuals on their equilibrium strategies about the pattern of implementing PCT scheme. The findings show that the emotions of government and individuals cannot influence the equilibrium of pure strategies, but do affect the equilibrium of the mixed strategy. Further analysis shows that the strategy of government can be influenced by individuals’ emotions, and government will move towards the “mandatory pattern” strategy when individuals are optimistic and towards the “voluntary pattern” strategy when individuals are pessimistic. Additionally, the strategy of individuals can be affected by government’s emotions, and individuals will move towards “rejection” strategy when government is optimistic and towards the “participation” strategy when government is pessimistic. Therefore, the most expected emotional state for government is to remain pessimistic and to keep individuals optimistic. This study demonstrated the effects of the heterogeneous emotions of government and individuals on the equilibrium strategies about the pattern of implementing PCT scheme, provided policy suggestions for the pattern of implementing PCT scheme, and contributed to the successful implementation of future PCT scheme as well as the achievement of global carbon emissions targets.",2019-01-15,10.1007/s11069-018-3496-4,"['Guo, Daoyan', 'Chen, Hong', 'Long, Ruyin']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-018-3496-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
180,Clean Energy and Energy Saving Policies in China,"When the Chinese government announced its plan to get 20% of China's energy from renewable sources by 2030, many were still in doubt of its commitment. After keeping the faith solely in economic growth for so many decades, it is hard to believe that China’s elite group can make a fast transition. However, resent reports on renewable surge in China may well illustrate the country’s determination on this account. The atrocious state of environment, as well as the concerns of energy security and economic development in the medium and longer run has prompted Chinese policy makers to carry out an energy revolution. The Chinese see this move as a chance of escaping the fossil fuel-reliance that saddled earlier industrial countries and a key for attaining sustainable development.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-981-13-3699-7_7,"['Wei, Yuwa']",Issues Decisive for China’s Rise or Fall,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-13-3699-7_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
181,Linking International Trade to Climate Change and Energy,"The argument goes that the causes of environmental problems in a market economy are economics and that the consequences of environmental problems have important economic dimensions that travel from producers to consumers of good and services. Hence, the importance of solutions that are environmentally effective, economically sensible, and politically pragmatic. In the specific case of trade, traditionally, the thinking has been that more trade meant more energy consumption and therefore higher levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Economic growth has come at a cost to the environment. But it does not have to be that way. Trade can be part of the solution to reducing GHG emissions by providing preferential treatment to green goods/services in trade agreements, leading consumers to buy green goods such as electric cars.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-23933-6_3,"['Leal-Arcas, Rafael']",Solutions for Sustainability,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-23933-6_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
182,Monitoring Energy Policy,"Policy monitoring has been gaining importance in energy and climate governance. It is currently being heralded as a key solution for coordinating energy governance not only regionally in the emerging Energy Union in the European Union (EU), but also globally in the Paris Agreement on climate change. The core idea is that transparency through monitoring will incentivize actors to adopt policy pathways toward mutually agreed long-term energy and climate policy goals. In addition, monitoring of key indicators (e.g., use of certain kinds of energy), in particular, sectoral contexts, may be a necessary precursor to evaluation and improved regulation. This chapter unpacks the concept of monitoring, reviews the emergence of energy and climate policy monitoring in the EU, and then details experiences with concrete monitoring regimes in different settings related to energy and climate policy, ranging from the United Nations (UN) to the EU, as well as nation states and nongovernmental actors. In so doing, it highlights various strands of emerging research and knowledge on monitoring structures, steering effects and costs, but also the need for further work, especially regarding usage and impact. Issues related to politics, coordination, and resources are likely to challenge monitoring regimes; further investigation should focus on the efficacy of monitoring systems, which many assume, but few have researched.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-73526-9_43-1,"['Schoenefeld, Jonas J.', 'Rayner, Tim']",Handbook of Energy Governance in Europe,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-73526-9_43-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
183,Emissions Trading,"Emissions trading is a market-based instrument to achieve environmental targets in a cost-effective way by allowing legal entities to buy and sell emission rights. The current international dissemination and intended linking of emissions trading schemes underlines the growing relevance of this instrument. There are three basic design variants of emissions trading: cap-and-trade (allowance trading), performance standard rate trading (credit trading), and project-based credit trading (such as domestic offsets, JI, and the CDM). These design variants are analyzed in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and acceptance. It is also explained why emissions trading schemes may become inefficient hybrids of such design variants.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-7753-2_61,"['Woerdman, Edwin']",Encyclopedia of Law and Economics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-7753-2_61,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
184,Tokyo’s Low-Emission Development Strategies Underlying the Promotion of Energy Efficiency in Public and Private Buildings,"Metropolitan cities are the cornerstones of economic development. They are showcases of technological advancement and are comprised of social infrastructures which accommodate dense populations. Nonetheless, as centers of production and consumption, they are also responsible for approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In this regard, Tokyo Metropolis, the world’s most populous metropolitan area and the world’s largest urban agglomeration economy, has a significant role to play as a leader of sustainable technology and services, and could act as an inspiration for other world centers. Despite directing copious amounts of investments toward the conformation of environmental regulations, however, Tokyo faces the challenge of balancing economic competitivity and socio-environmental sustainability. In order to assess the most successful greenhouse gas reduction opportunities that are present in the context of Tokyo, this chapter has reviewed the projects and environmental policies that have been initiated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government since 2000. In essence, this chapter scrutinized the “Tokyo Metropolitan Environmental Security Ordinance”; “Tokyo Climate Change Strategy”; and the “Tokyo Metropolitan Environmental Master Plan” policies and the programs that were brought to life through their enactment. The findings from the policy review indicate that out of the three dominant programs occupying the space surrounding the energy efficiency of industrial, commercial, and residential buildings, the greenhouse gas reductions achieved by the Tokyo Cap & Trade program were the most notable and amounted to 10 million tons of CO_2 at the end of the first compliance period. Despite regulating a fraction of the companies residing in Tokyo, 91% of the facilities surpassed the mandatory targets of 6–8% during the first compliance period, and 80% had surpassed the targets of 15–17% by the end of the first year of the second compliance period, showing great potential for future CO_2 reductions.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-981-13-0782-9_10,"['Iliopoulos, Nikolaos', 'Farzaneh, Hooman', 'Ohgaki, Hideaki']",Devising a Clean Energy Strategy for Asian Cities,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-13-0782-9_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
185,Global ETS Operation and Their Merits and Demerits,"Since the Kyoto Protocol (KP) was signed in 1997, all parties to the KP have been actively exploring the path to transit to a low-carbon economy, and using a market mechanism to cut Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and save the cost for emission reduction.

186,Biofuel in Developing Countries—Ethical Concerns,"The uses of energy are vast, and the demand for it increases every year. With this, energy is becoming a scarce commodity, and therefore, scientists are coming up with different sources to derive energy from. Energy is obtained from many different types of sources commonly oil, coal and natural gas. Renewable sources are also existent and include but not limited to wind, solar and hydropower. But without efficient use of these resources, energy sources are slowly being depleted causing a demand to find more energy sources. Biofuel is energy obtained from biomass or biowaste, basically plant and animal material. It has been a great solution for the energy problems that the world is facing, but there have been concerns with its production. The concerns are ethical, social, economic, environmental and technical issues that arise out of the methods of the current production of biofuels. Social and ethical issues that arise are such as human rights, solidarity, sustainability, stewardship and justice. In this paper, the principle outlines that the environment should be able to sustain biofuels which should also help in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Trade principles relating to biofuels should be fair and benefits be distributed equitably. Its usage should not come as an expense of the communities’ basic rights of food, water and work rights. Since biofuel is obtained from plants and animals, too much production of it may lead to reduced food distribution to the people, which denies them the basic right of food.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-10856-4_13,"['Albatayneh, Aiman', 'Al-Khasawneh, Yaqoub', 'Alawneh, Firas', 'Alkhazali, Atif', 'Mohaidat, Sulaiman']",Advanced Studies in Energy Efficiency and Built Environment for Developing Countries,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-10856-4_13,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
187,A Unilateral Climate and Supply Market Model,"In the midst of its respective energy transitions, the European power sector faces several challenges. Low levels of both European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) allowance prices and wholesale power prices fuelled concerns over drivers for decarbonisation and long-term generation adequacy. Whilst some countries have introduced capacity remuneration mechanisms to ensure generation adequacy, reforming the EU ETS has proven to be difficult. This paper proposes a unilateral approach by a state introducing a CO_2 levy that internalises and prices CO_2 at a national level. The suggested climate and supply market model thereby incentivises and rewards production from CO_2-neutral sources during times when it does not cover the targeted share of production. Prior to describing the model in detail, this paper discusses the theoretical policy steering background and the problems associated with current energy policies. For a broader picture, other CO_2 taxation models are briefly presented. This is followed by a discussion on the legal aspects of the model, its compatibility with international as well as EU law. The model is explored further by using Switzerland as an example, showing that a cross-sector carbon price can be implemented at acceptable costs for consumers. Last but not least, the paper examines varieties of the model and the adaption potential for European countries.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-03152-7_10,"['Blume-Werry, Eike', 'Koller, Martin', 'Everts, Martin']",Understanding Risks and Uncertainties in Energy and Climate Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-03152-7_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
188,Feasibility Analysis of a Cap-and-Trade System in Mexico and Implications to Circular Economy,"Market-based instruments, such as the cap-and-trade, have been widely used to address the increase of greenhouse gases (GHG). In line with other geographic regions, Mexico has seen the need to expand the options of market instruments to mitigate the effects of climate change. Simultaneously, there are important reasons to move towards a circular economy model. In this context, this research seeks to answer if it’s feasible to implement a cap-and-trade system in Mexico as part of its climate policy. That said, firstly, it analyses and assesses the cap-and-trade system in Mexico based upon its contextual environment, its potential of implementation and its economic and environmental benefits and costs. Secondly, it highlights the implications of considering circular economy models into a cap-and-trade instrument. Through the use of marginal abatement cost curves (MACC), it was found that the percentage of measures to reduce GHG with negative cost agglomerates 57% of all the measures, which could translate into a benefit for the economy as a whole by almost 1% of GDP by 2020. As part of the conclusions, we argued that MACC results prove partially that the cap-and-trade system is a feasible option to apply in Mexico. In addition, a cap-and-trade mechanism should show a strong carbon price signal felt by end users and therefore motivates the application of circular economy principles, which are related to the introduction of innovations to enable the closing of current materials and energy loops along the supply production chain.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-92931-6_4,"['Cruz-Pastrana, José-Luis', 'Franco-García, María-Laura']",Towards Zero Waste,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-92931-6_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
189,Overview of Chinese Pilots ETS and Characteristics,"For the purpose of fulfilling China’s carbon emissions reduction targets by 2020 through a cost-efficient market mechanism, and expediting transformation of economic growth pattern and upgrading industrial structure, China’s State Council, at the end of 2011, issued the Work Plan for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Control during the 12th Five - Year Plan Period , which requires to “explore and establish a national unified carbon emissions trading market.” In response to the State Council’s plan, the NDRC, in October 2011, initiated a carbon emissions trading pilot program in seven regions, including five municipalities as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Shenzhen, and two provinces as Hubei and Guangdong, the earliest pilot ETS which open its carbon market is Shenzhen ETS in June, 2013, and the latest launched is Chongqing ETS in June 2014.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-981-13-1888-7_3,"['Zhao, Daiqing', 'Wang, Wenjun', 'Luo, Zhigang']",A Brief Overview of China’s ETS Pilots,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-13-1888-7_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
190,EU Climate and Energy Policy Beyond 2020: Are Additional Targets and Instruments for Renewables Economically Reasonable?,"The European Union has decided to increase its target for greenhouse gas emissions reductions to 40% by 2030, compared to 1990 emissions levels. In contrast, the target for the share of renewable energy sources in electricity consumption—even though increased to 27%—will not be binding anymore for Member States beyond 2020. This is in line with many existing assessments which demonstrate that additional RES policies impair the cost-effectiveness of addressing a single CO_2 externality, and should therefore be abolished. Our analysis explores to what extent this reasoning holds in a second-best setting with multiple externalities related to fossil and nuclear power generation and policy constraints. In this context, an additional RES policy may help to address externalities for which first-best policy responses are not available. In addition, we also argue that an unambiguous, “objective” economic assessment is impossible because (i) policies may have a multiplicity of impacts, (ii) the size of these impacts is subject to uncertainties and (iii) their valuation is contingent on individual preferences. Thus, the eventual decision on the optimal choice and design of climate and energy policies can only be taken politically.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-03374-3_2,"['Lehmann, Paul', 'Gawel, Erik', 'Strunz, Sebastian']",The European Dimension of Germany’s Energy Transition,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-03374-3_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

192,Regulatory Framework for Development of Renewable Energy Generation in Turkey,"Turkey accepts renewable energy as one of the important mitigation options and tools for satisfying the growth in energy needs by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, besides being a key pillar of its strategy. As part of its indigenization policy, Turkey wants to increase the share of renewable energy in total energy production by at least 30 percent and the commissioning of more new renewable energy investments. Substantial progress has been made on the regulatory side to promote electricity generation from renewable sources. Identification of Turkish renewable energy policies and regulations on electricity generation, in addition to legislative barriers and opportunities that prevent or enable widespread deployment of renewable energy are of importance for the investors. Although there are shortcomings in theory and practice, it seems Turkish fast-growing renewable market, particularly RE-Zone projects and probably rooftop solar projects, will be attractive markets for investors.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-14207-0_6,"['Döğerlioğlu Işıksungur, Özlem']",Renewable Energy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-14207-0_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
193,Social and Environmental Accounting (SEA) Research in the Public Sector: The Portuguese Case,"Research on environmental accounting and reporting practices has been centred on private corporations (Mathews 2004 ; Parker 2005 ; Milne and Gray 2007 ). In public sector organisations only little research has been carried out (Ball and Grubnic 2007 ; Ball and Bebbignton 2008 ; Farneti and Guthrie 2009 ; Gray et al. 2009 ; Guthrie et al. 2010 ). Literature shows there is a lack of empirical research on public social and environmental accounting (SEA) and most studies are largely focused on an Anglo-Saxon context and more specifically on countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom (Gibson and Guthrie 1995 ; Burritt and Welch 1997 ; Frost and Toh 1998 ; Frost and Seamer 2002 ; McElroy et al. 2005 ; Qian et al. 2011 ). Within the Portuguese context, little evidence is available related to public SEA (Verónica 2007; Ribeiro and Guzman 2010 . Ribeiro et al. 2016a ). In fact, there is no tradition of such empirical research in Portugal, particularly in the public sector. Thus, our study aims to enrich the international literature on SEA in public entities by providing a snapshot of Portugal’s situation, where empirical evidence is still relatively unknown. Some studies suggest that accountants are involved in the SEA process in public entities, but there is still some room for improvement (Williams et al. 2010 ; Williams 2015 ). This paper also examines the ways in which professional accountants can encourage and support public entities to increase the low-level of sustainability accounting and reporting practices.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-981-13-1047-8_13,"['Ribeiro, Verónica Paula Lima', 'Monteiro, Sónia Maria']",Responsibility and Governance,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-13-1047-8_13,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

197,Distributional Considerations for Transboundary Risk Governance of Environmental Threats,"Most policy analyses of both short-term and long-term disasters focus on aggregate impacts of their costs and the benefits of policy remedies. Distributional considerations relating to the costs of these disasters and the benefits of their risk management, however, are very important in many cases. This article examines two broad categories of cases in terms of distributional considerations. The first category is where transboundary considerations strongly affect risk governance, as in the case of climate change. The second relates to ordinary, short-term disasters, which include fewer, but still important, transboundary issues. Climate change policy requires information regarding the distribution of impacts and policy responses across countries because it is a global problem. Conventional disasters involve transboundary considerations much less frequently, so the attention typically shifts to the distribution of benefits and costs within a jurisdiction. In both cases distributional information is needed to evaluate the equity of policies and to provide information for public participation in the policy process. This article offers modeling and policy approaches to address these issues.",2018-12-01,10.1007/s13753-018-0205-6,"['Rose, Adam']",International Journal of Disaster Risk Science,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13753-018-0205-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

We found by observing the characteristics of publications that such studies belong to a multidisciplinary field that has been continuously developing since the 1990s. The USA and the UK have maintained their leading research strengths in the field, whereas China entered late but has developed rapidly. The most productive journal, institution, and author in this field are Energy Policy, Resources for the Future, and Pizer from the USA, respectively. The auctorial and institutional cooperation degrees are growing and still have a broad collaboration space, but the cooperation among countries is fluctuating at a lower level. Nonetheless, the USA keeps its significant international cooperation ties. The bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis reveals that articles in this field are closely related to one another. The basic literature in the field was written by Weitzman and published in 1974, and the article by Nordhaus published in Science in 1992 is the most cited in the field.

199,Elements of success in multi-stakeholder deliberation platforms,"Deliberation platforms are an important component of the multi-actor science-policy interface within the realm of environmental governance, increasingly characterized by the engagement of a diversity of actors. Deliberation platforms provide a mechanism through which stakeholders with diverse perspectives can both discuss problems and explore potential solutions related to environmental governance, integrating scientific and other knowledge. This study employs a Qualitative Content Analysis of 16 semi-structured interviews to investigate which elements of deliberation platforms are most central to their success and how these elements interact with one another from the perspective of public engagers. This fills a gap in the literature on the qualification of knowledge and experience of public engagers regarding the organization of multi-stakeholder deliberation platforms. Elements to consider in the organization of deliberation platforms were ranked, and five central elements were identified: (1) the selection of participants relevant to the topic and conducive to positive interactions, (2) openness as an attitude in both organizers and participants, (3) facilitation of interactions and the role of the facilitator, (4) communication and transparency between organizers and participants, and (5) fostering dialog between participants through various means. Different manifestations of these five central elements which can fit best within different particular contexts and suit various objectives are also investigated based on the interview material. The discussion summarizes the lessons learned with regards to organizing deliberation platforms from the perspective of public engagers, and explores the potential for trade-offs and co-benefits between central elements as a means to improve the efficiency and efficacy of organizing such platforms. Furthermore, the links between the central elements and social learning, as a particular, overarching objective of deliberation platforms, are discussed. This study is an important step towards further analysis of deliberation platforms, necessary in order to avoid the risks of convening actors with diverse perspectives to discuss politically-relevant topics.

200,Expert networks as science-policy interlocutors in the implementation of a monitoring reporting and verification (MRV) system,"The Paris Agreement, which entered into effect in 2016, emphasizes a definite timeline for communicating and maintaining successive nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that it plans to achieve in addressing climate change. This calls for the development of a measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) system and a Capacity-building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT). Though such actions are universally accepted by the Parties to the Paris Agreement, earlier studies have shown that there remain technological, social, political and financial constrains which will affect the development and deployment of such a system. In this paper, using a case study on MRV implementation in Bogor City in Indonesia, how the above-mentioned challenges can be overcome is outlined through a technological and policy innovation process where scientists and technologists (collectively referred as expert networks) can join hands with local governments and national policy makers in designing, development and implementation of an MRV system that meets the local, national and global requirements. Through the case study it is further observed that expert networks can act as interactive knowledge generators and policy interlocutors in bridging technology with policy. To be specific, first, a brief history of the international context of MRV and CBIT is outlined.

201,A framework for evaluating geographic disparities in energy transition vulnerability,"The path towards decarbonization promises many societal benefits such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions and new technological innovation. The adverse effects of policies that are helping to facilitate the energy transition, such as price spikes or job displacement, however, are not evenly spread across the population, and some individuals and communities are more vulnerable to possible adverse impacts than others. Here, we adapt a framework for conceptualizing vulnerability from the climate change adaptation literature to the energy context. We construct the dimensions of the framework, provide an illustration using the case of the renewable portfolio standard, generate a vulnerability score measure and map vulnerability across US counties. Our analysis shows that this framework can be used to identify geographical disparities, and should be further developed in future research to provide deeper insights about a just transition. Positive and negative impacts of energy transitions will not be evenly distributed. In this Perspective, the authors present a framework to map geographic variation in vulnerability from energy policies that can be built on in future work to support just policy-making.",2018-08-01,10.1038/s41560-018-0142-z,"['Carley, Sanya', 'Evans, Tom P.', 'Graff, Michelle', 'Konisky, David M.']",Nature Energy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-018-0142-z.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
202,"Organic carbon distribution and cycling in the Quercus glauca forest at Gotjawal wetland, Jeju Island, Korea","Background This study was conducted from March 2011 to February 2013 in order to evaluate the ecosystem value by examining the organic carbon distribution and cycling in the Quercus glauca forest, evergreen oak community at Seonheul-Gotjawal, Jeju Island. Results The amount of organic carbon distribution was 124.5 ton C ha^− 1 in 2011 and 132.63 ton C ha^− 1 in 2012 for aboveground biomass. And it was 31.13 ton C ha^− 1 in 2011 and 33.16 ton C ha^− 1 in 2012 for belowground biomass. In total, the amount of organic carbon distribution in plants was 155.63 and 165.79 ton C ha^− 1 in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In 2011 and 2012 respectively, the amount of organic carbon distribution was 3.61 and 6.39 ton C ha^− 1 in the forest floor and it was 78.89 and 100.71 ton C ha^− 1 in the soil. As shown, most carbon was distributed in plants. Overall, the amount of organic carbon distribution of the Q. glauca forest was 238.13 ton C ha^− 1 in 2011 and 272.89 ton C ha^− 1 in 2012. In 2011, the amount of organic carbon fixed in plants through photosynthesis (NPP) was 14.22 ton C ha^− 1 year^− 1 and the amount of carbon emission of soil respiration was 16.77 ton C ha^− 1 year^− 1. The net ecosystem production (NEP) absorbed by the Q. glauca forest from the atmosphere was 5 ton C ha^− 1 year^− 1. Conclusions The carbon storage value based on such organic carbon distribution was estimated about 23.81 mil won ha^− 1 in 2011 and 27.29 mil won ha^− 1 in 2012, showing an annual increment of carbon storage value by 3.48 mil won ha^− 1. The carbon absorption value based on such NEP was estimated about 500,000 won ha^− 1 year^− 1.",2018-05-24,10.1186/s41610-018-0068-1,"['Han, Young-Sub', 'Lee, Eung-Pill', 'Park, Jae-Hoon', 'Lee, Seung-Yeon', 'Lee, Soo-In', 'You, Young-Han']",Journal of Ecology and Environment,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s41610-018-0068-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
203,Agricultural technologies and carbon emissions: evidence from Jordanian economy,"Theoretically, agriculture can be the victim and the cause of climate change. Using annual data for the period of 1970–2014, this study examines the interaction between agriculture technology factors and the environment in terms of carbon emissions in Jordan. The results provide evidence for unidirectional causality running from machinery, subsidies, and other transfers, rural access to an improved water source and fertilizers to carbon emissions. The results also reveal the existence of bidirectional causality between the real income and carbon emissions. The variance error decompositions highlight the importance of subsidies and machinery in explaining carbon emissions. They also show that fertilizers, the crop and livestock production, the land under cereal production, the water access, the agricultural value added, and the real income have an increasing effect on carbon emissions over the forecast period. These results are important so that policy-makers can build up strategies and take in considerations the indicators in order to reduce carbon emissions in Jordan.",2018-04-01,10.1007/s11356-018-1327-5,"['Ismael, Mohanad', 'Srouji, Fathi', 'Boutabba, Mohamed Amine']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-018-1327-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
204,Scenarios towards limiting global mean temperature increase below 1.5 °C,"The 2015 Paris Agreement calls for countries to pursue efforts to limit global-mean temperature rise to 1.5 °C. The transition pathways that can meet such a target have not, however, been extensively explored. Here we describe scenarios that limit end-of-century radiative forcing to 1.9 W m^−2, and consequently restrict median warming in the year 2100 to below 1.5 °C. We use six integrated assessment models and a simple climate model, under different socio-economic, technological and resource assumptions from five Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). Some, but not all, SSPs are amenable to pathways to 1.5 °C. Successful 1.9 W m^−2 scenarios are characterized by a rapid shift away from traditional fossil-fuel use towards large-scale low-carbon energy supplies, reduced energy use, and carbon-dioxide removal. However, 1.9 W m^−2 scenarios could not be achieved in several models under SSPs with strong inequalities, high baseline fossil-fuel use, or scattered short-term climate policy. Further research can help policy-makers to understand the real-world implications of these scenarios. Scenarios that constrain end-of-century radiative forcing to 1.9 W m^–2, and thus global mean temperature increases to below 1.5 °C, are explored. Effective scenarios reduce energy use, deploy CO_2 removal measures, and shift to non-emitting energy sources.",2018-04-01,10.1038/s41558-018-0091-3,"['Rogelj, Joeri', 'Popp, Alexander', 'Calvin, Katherine V.', 'Luderer, Gunnar', 'Emmerling, Johannes', 'Gernaat, David', 'Fujimori, Shinichiro', 'Strefler, Jessica', 'Hasegawa, Tomoko', 'Marangoni, Giacomo', 'Krey, Volker', 'Kriegler, Elmar', 'Riahi, Keywan', 'van Vuuren, Detlef P.', 'Doelman, Jonathan', 'Drouet, Laurent', 'Edmonds, Jae', 'Fricko, Oliver', 'Harmsen, Mathijs', 'Havlík, Petr', 'Humpenöder, Florian', 'Stehfest, Elke', 'Tavoni, Massimo']",Nature Climate Change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0091-3.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
205,Developing China’s National Emission Trading Scheme: Experiences from Existing Global Schemes and China’s Pilot Programs,"Market-based emission trading schemes (ETSs) are widely used in the developed world to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions which are perceived as the source of global climate change. China, as the largest GHG emitter in the world, is committed to introducing an ETS to reduce emissions. Here we reviewed existing ETSs and sustainable energy policies worldwide as well as China’s pilot programs. These studies were conducted in order to propose recommendations for national initiatives and strategies to be implemented in China in relation to climate change adaptation and mitigation. It has been shown that setting emission caps in the context of a national emission intensity target is difficult. However, implementing reliable systems for measurement, reporting, and verification of emissions are essential. A two-level management system (by central and provincial governments) for carbon trading is beneficial to ensure uniform standards and compliance while maintaining flexibility. Persistent political support from, and effective coordination of, policies by the government are crucial. In addition, strengthening of institutional innovation, and the establishment of a national GHG emissions information system, are of equal importance. This vital information could provide a great opportunity for China to re-define its economic growth and take global leadership in combatting climate change.",2018-04-01,10.1007/s11769-018-0947-5,"['Ning, Bolun', 'Zhu, Yongguan', 'Xu, Zhihong', 'Fu, Bojie']",Chinese Geographical Science,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11769-018-0947-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
206,Bottom-up linking of carbon markets under far-sighted cap coordination and reversibility,"The Paris Agreement relies on nationally determined contributions to reach its targets and asks countries to increase ambitions over time, leaving open the details of this process. Although overcoming countries’ myopic ‘free-riding’ incentives requires cooperation, the global public good character of mitigation makes forming coalitions difficult. To cooperate, countries may link their carbon markets^ 1 , but is this option beneficial^ 2 ? Some countries might not participate, not agree to lower caps, or not comply to agreements. While non-compliance might be deterred^ 3 , countries can hope that if they don’t participate, others might still form a coalition. When considering only one coalition whose members can leave freely, the literature following the publication of refs ^ 4 , 5 finds meagre prospects for effective collaboration^ 6 . Countries also face incentives to increase emissions when linking their markets without a cap agreement^ 7 , 8 . Here, we analyse the dynamics of market linkage using a game-theoretic model of far-sighted coalition formation. In contrast to non-dynamic models and dynamic models without far-sightedness^ 9 , 10 , in our model an efficient global coalition always forms eventually if players are sufficiently far-sighted or caps are coordinated immediately when markets are linked. Meeting mitigation targets requires domestic action and international cooperation. This study uses game-theoretic modelling to understand carbon-market linkages and to show the conditions that facilitate global coalition formation.",2018-03-01,10.1038/s41558-018-0079-z,"['Heitzig, Jobst', 'Kornek, Ulrike']",Nature Climate Change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0079-z.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
207,A Decentralized Bi-Level Fuzzy Two-Stage Decision Model for Flood Management,"Flood, as a serious worldwide environment problem, can lead to detrimental economic losses and fatalities. Effective flood control is desired to mitigate the adverse impacts of flooding and the associated flood risk through development of cost-effective and efficient flood management decisions and policies. A bi-level fuzzy two-stage stochastic programming model, named BIFS model is developed in this study to provide decision support for economic analysis of flood management. The BIFS model is capable of not only addressing the sequential decision making issue involving the two-level decision makers, but also correcting the pre-regulated flood management decisions before the occurrence of a flood event in the two-stage environment. The probabilistic and non-probabilistic uncertainties expressed as probability density functions and fuzzy sets are quantitatively analyzed. The overall satisfaction solution is obtained for meeting the goals of the two-level decision makers by compromising, reflecting the tradeoffs among various decision makers in the two decision-making levels. The results of application of the BIFS model to a representative case study indicate informed decision strategies for flood management. Tradeoffs between economic objectives and uncertainty-averse attitudes of decision makers are quantified.",2018-03-01,10.1007/s11269-017-1894-0,"['Wang, Hong', 'Zhang, Xiaodong']",Water Resources Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11269-017-1894-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

210,Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions from Solid Waste Management: Prognosis of Related Issues,"The implementation of cleaner waste treatment technologies in developing countries is accompanied by myriads of limitations and obstacles. This study reports that greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions that would not have happened with business-as-usual scenarios are achievable in the waste management system under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The grounds for CDM failures and successes were reviewed by reflecting on the past and current episodes in developing countries. It was found that economic development was directly proportional to increase in waste generation rate and influenced waste composition. The need to decouple waste production from Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and linking the prevalence of more low-carbon emissions waste treatment options were found essential to ensure sustainable development and mitigate climate change. Based on the present evaluation, Brazil and Thailand have had the largest number of CDM projects and mostly small-scale projects with the highest maximum emission reductions in Brazil (751, 148 Mt CO_2e) followed by Vietnam (158, 727 Mt CO_2e) and India (158, 077 Mt CO_2e). It was found that small-scale projects were more feasible as technology transfer and financial status were hindering the implementation of large-scale CDM projects. Moreover, emissions trading through CDM were accompanied by technical obstructions in terms of carbon leakage, permit allowances and unfair carbon price with irregular international policies and regulations to control GHGs. This study highlights the potential of a carbon trading scheme through CDM waste management projects designed to aid highly polluting developed countries achieve their target baselines for carbon emissions. The increasing GHG emissions in developing and least developed countries could be tackled at the early stages of economic growth through financial and technological assistance from industrialized countries.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-63612-2_22,"['Leelah, Sunjaya', 'Mudhoo, Ackmez']","The Nexus: Energy, Environment and Climate Change",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-63612-2_22,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
211,China: Deepening Cooperation on Climate and Environmental Governance,"As a result of chronic environmental challenges, China’s political leadership has paid increasing attention to the ecological limits of rapid economic growth. As concern has grown, China’s leaders have looked beyond their borders for solutions. Hence, climate change and environment have emerged as increasingly prominent and productive dimensions of the EU-China relationship. This chapter argues that China has looked to—and adopted—European-inspired environmental policies, such as emissions trading, and environmental decision-making institutions. Other non-European actors have also played prominent roles in China. We trace how European-inspired policies on greenhouse gas emissions trading and environmental decision-making institutions have been modified, sometimes significantly, in the process of adoption in China.

In the absence of a national emissions reduction mandate, CCX established a voluntary but legally binding self-regulated membership system under basic US contract law and operated from 2003 to 2010, pioneering the carbon pricing carbon pricing field worldwide. CCX recruited large and small companies, cities, counties and universities, and through CCX there were more emissions covered by a cap-and-trade system in the USA than in any other country in the world at the time, even though the USA had turned its back on the Kyoto Protocol. What accounts for this achievement and what can be learned from the grit, passion and ups and downs of CCX?

214,"The Electricity Mix in the European Low-Carbon Transformation: Coal, Nuclear, and Renewables","The European Union has embarked on the transformation of its energy and electricity system to low-carbon energy sources, just like Germany and many other countries. This chapter analyzes the European strategy for low-carbon transformation in relation to specific aspects and features of the German energiewende. Due to the different preferences, objectives, and institutional settings of decision-making processes in Germany and Europe, lessons from the German context are not directly applicable to the European context and vice versa. While some lessons apply to both—such as the German experience with ambitious CO_2 reduction targets—others do not, such as the potential role of coal and nuclear energy in the longer-term energy mix. The chapter begins with a brief survey of European energy (and later climate) policies going back to 1951, with the decisions to establish the European Community for Steel and Coal (ECSC) and subsequently Euratom in 1957. Section 10.2 covers the creation of the European internal market in the 1990s and its application to the energy sectors (mainly electricity and natural gas); it also covers more recent discussions, such as the energy and climate package to 2020, the 2030 targets, and the parallel discussion about longer-term orientations up to 2050. Sections 10.3 , 10.4 , and 10.5 analyze the three pillars of European transformation towards a low-carbon energy system: coal with CO_2 sequestration, nuclear power, and renewables. In this context, we discuss a major difference between the European transformation to a low-carbon economy and the German energiewende: The two energy sources that Germany has banned from its energy mix, coal and nuclear, are still high on the European agenda. Meanwhile, the potential of renewables has been systematically underestimated in European scenario documents, due mainly to an overestimation of costs and an underestimation of the technical potential. Section 10.6 then compares two alternative scenarios for a low-carbon transformation in Europe: one is the EU Reference Scenario, which is based on the traditional triad of coal (with CCTS), nuclear, and renewables. In the other scenario, based on our own modelling work, neither CCTS nor nuclear are available at a reasonable cost and renewables carry the major burden of decarbonisation.

215,Bioeconomy Opportunities in the Danube Region,"The Danube Region is an area of Europe with high potentials of biomass resources, and many studies point out the comparatively high biomass potential in the Central European region in the forms of different forestry and agricultural residues. However, in order to exploit these resources, considerable investments are needed to build biorefineries, trigger market demand for bio-based products and guarantee the security and sustainability of the long-term biomass supply requiring active involvement of farmers. These challenges are sizeable, and call for a holistic approach, a transition period and harmonized policy support. However, the authors believe that the transition can speed up with the involvement of industry players, building on existing value chains and infrastructures, all placed in an enabling and business supporting environment. In this chapter, the authors aim to introduce the Danube Region and its potentials in sustainable biomass resources, providing an overview of main supply chains and players as well as of policy instruments and constraints that are currently slowing the development of the bioeconomy. Based on the current situation and its critical analysis, the authors propose a strategy that can move forward the bioeconomy in the Danube Region and probably multiplied also in other geographical areas. In order to realize the multiple benefits and decrease the financial and market risks, in this chapter, we will introduce circular economy and sustainable intensification approaches that build on industry involvement in order to obtain working business models. This approach could facilitate the bioeconomy transition by merging novel technologies into working value chains to valorize by-products and could make stakeholders interested by providing an additional revenue stream instead of waste management fee.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-73028-8_6,"['Gyalai-Korpos, Miklós', 'Szabó, Zoltán', 'Hollósy, Miklós', 'Dávid, Bence', 'Pencz, Kinga', 'Fehér, Csaba', 'Barta, Zsolt']","Towards a Sustainable Bioeconomy: Principles, Challenges and Perspectives",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-73028-8_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

Mutual influence and cooperation can be observed in some policy areas, coexistence of divergent policies and conflict in others. The nature of EU-US interaction has fluctuated over the course of time and with domestic political changes. Both are actors of similar strength and with highly developed environmental policies so that capacity building is largely absent from EU-US environmental interaction.

221,"Economic Growth, Development, and Innovation: The Transformation Towards a Knowledge-Based Bioeconomy","To improve sustainability, the global economic system has to undergo severe transformation processes. This chapter deals with the possibility of an innovation-triggered transformation towards a knowledge-based bioeconomy, which is supposed to overcome the current lock-in into a fossil fuel-based CO_2-intensive production. To do this, a neo-Schumpeterian view is applied that highlights the complex interplay in knowledge generation and knowledge diffusion processes between firms, consumers, and government institutions. By applying the neo-Schumpeterian approach, it becomes obvious that innovation and economic growth are part of the solution and not part of the sustainability problem. The shift from quantitative growth to qualitative development makes the difference and affects all agents and institutions in an economic system, which needs to be designed as a dedicated innovation system supporting the transformation towards a knowledge-based bioeconomy.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-68152-8_11,"['Pyka, Andreas', 'Prettner, Klaus']",Bioeconomy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-68152-8_11,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
222,Dedicated innovation systems to support the transformation towards sustainability: creating income opportunities and employment in the knowledge-based digital bioeconomy,"In order to counter something to the most thrilling challenges of mankind at the beginning of the twenty-first century, production and consumption systems need to transform towards sustainability. We argue that the knowledge-based bioeconomy and digitalization are two promising technological approaches which require to be thought together in order to contribute to the transformation and to trigger the required technological dynamics. However, such a broad transformative process requires a participation of all societal stakeholders. Innovation systems in principle offer a framework for policy designs supporting the transformation, but they need to be extended to include the direction towards overcoming the lock-in in oil-based economic activities and mass consumption. For this purpose, we introduce the idea of a Dedicated Innovation System, which takes care of potential inertia due to the interest of established (oil-based) industries and consider the economic opportunities raised by social and responsible innovation. The transformation process will likely compensate for decreasing jobs in traditional sectors, which are increasingly replaced by robotics and artificial intelligence. The knowledge-based digital bioeconomy is likely to generate the emergence of new sectors with new employment opportunities, e.g. in periphery regions or in the emerging sharing-economy sector.",2017-12-28,10.1186/s40852-017-0079-7,"['Pyka, Andreas']","Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40852-017-0079-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
223,Emissions trading for households? A behavioral law and economics perspective,"This is the first research article on expanding emissions trading in the EU to households in which law and economics is explicitly and systematically combined with behavioral science. The goal of the article is neither to plead in favor nor against emissions trading for households, but rather to provide an analysis of such a scheme. To that end, the article gathers relevant theoretical insights and discusses how established empirical findings can be used to design a potentially workable scheme. The analysis not only presents an overview of possible economic and behavioral barriers, but also creates a feedback to its institutional design by presenting possible solutions to overcome them. Downstream allocation creates a more direct and visible carbon incentive, whereas administrative costs can be reduced by concentrating monitoring and enforcement upstream. Behavioral acceptance can be boosted via strategic communication, for instance by stressing that emissions trading is both effective (emissions are capped) and fair (those who emit less, pay less). Energy conservation can be stimulated by frequently sending updates to households of their carbon transactions to make the consequences of their behavior more noticeable. Whether these necessary conditions are also sufficient to ensure political acceptance remains an open question.",2017-12-01,10.1007/s10657-015-9516-x,"['Woerdman, Edwin', 'Bolderdijk, Jan Willem']",European Journal of Law and Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10657-015-9516-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
224,"Restricted linking of emissions trading systems: options, benefits, and challenges","With over 17 emissions trading systems (ETSs) now in place across four continents, interest in linking ETSs is growing. Linking ETSs offers economic, political, and administrative benefits. It also faces major challenges. Linking can affect overall ambition, financial flows, and the location and nature of investments, reduces regulatory autonomy, and requires harmonization of ETS design elements. This article examines three options that could help overcome challenges by restricting the flow of units among jurisdictions through quotas, exchange rates, or discount rates. We use a simple model and three criteria—abatement outcome, economic implications, and feasibility—to assess these ‘restricted linking’ options. Quotas can enhance cost-effectiveness relative to no linking and allow policy-makers to retain control on the extent of unit flows. Exchange rates can create abatement and economic benefits or unintended adverse implications for cost-effectiveness and total abatement, depending on how rates are set. Due to information asymmetries between the regulated entities and policy-makers setting the exchange rate, as well as uncertainties about future developments, setting exchange rates in a manner that avoids such unintended consequences could prove difficult. Discount rates, in contrast, can ensure that both cost-effectiveness and total abatement are enhanced. Overall, restricted linking options do not achieve the benefits of full linking, but also avoid some major pitfalls, as well as offering levers that can be adjusted, should linking concerns prove to be more significant than anticipated.",2017-12-01,10.1007/s10784-017-9370-0,"['Schneider, Lambert', 'Lazarus, Michael', 'Lee, Carrie', 'van Asselt, Harro']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-017-9370-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

              -intensive power generation and REDD-based emission offsets with a benefit-sharing mechanism","We propose and explore financial instruments supporting programs for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (FI-REDD). Within a microeconomic framework we model interactions between an electricity producer (EP), electricity consumer (EC), and forest owner (FO). To keep their profit at a maximum, the EP responds to increasing $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ CO 2 prices by adjusting electricity quantities generated by different technologies and charging a higher electricity price to the EC. The EP can prepare for future high (uncertain) $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ CO 2 prices by employing FI-REDD: they can purchase an amount of offsets under an unknown future $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ CO 2 price and later, when the $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ CO 2 price is discovered, decide how many of these offsets to use for actually offsetting emissions and sell the rest on the market, sharing the revenue with the FO. FI-REDD allows for optional consumption of emission offsets by the EP (any amount up to the initially contracted volume is allowed), and includes a benefit-sharing mechanism between the EP and FO as it regards unused offsets. The modeling results indicate that FI-REDD might help avoid bankruptcy of $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ CO 2 -intensive producers at high levels of $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ CO 2 prices and therefore serve as a stabilizing mechanism during the transition of energy systems to greener technologies. The analytical results demonstrate the limits for potential market size explained by existing uncertainties.

226,"Equity, Emissions Allowance Trading and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change","The Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21), held in Paris in December 2015, resulted in voluntary greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction pledges, independent of each other, by 195 countries. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the equity implications of this “bottom-up” approach to climate change negotiations in two major ways. First we analyze the GHG reduction targets specified in the COP21 agreement prior to any emissions trading in terms of the Gini Coefficient equity metric. We also compare the pledges with specific equity principles proposed by developing countries for many years, such as the Egalitarian and Ability to Pay equity. Second, we analyze the equity outcomes after emissions trading takes place for a sample of countries/regions. We find that international policy coordination through a system of tradable GHG emissions allowances can greatly lower the cost to all participants of reducing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. An emissions trading system involving all countries and regions that made unconditional pledges at COP21 could reduce total GHG mitigation costs from an estimated $1.71 trillion to $0.4 trillion (in 2015 dollars), a savings of 77%. The ensuing allowance sales revenues would greatly enhance the capability of lower-income countries to meet their COP21 pledges. Moreover, the cost-savings in high-income countries would facilitate contributions to the promised fund of $100 billion per year to assist climate policy implementation in low-income countries.",2017-10-01,10.1007/s41885-017-0012-3,"['Rose, Adam', 'Wei, Dan', 'Miller, Noah', 'Vandyck, Toon']",Economics of Disasters and Climate Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s41885-017-0012-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

This conclusion can be traced to just a few “normative” assumptions, over which there exists fundamental disagreement amongst economists. This paper explores two axes of this disagreement. The first axis (“market vs. regulation”) measures faith in the invisible hand to adjust the natural thermostat. The second axis expresses differences in views on the efficiency and equity implications of climate action. The two axes combined lead to a classification of conflicting approaches in climate economics.

Using a suite of incentives, including some from the trade arena, a club of carbon markets could serve as a powerful attractive nucleus for broadening the participation of jurisdictions in climate mitigation, much as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) served as the nucleus for broadening trade in products and services.

Intensity targets substantially increase the complexity of policy simulation and analysis, because a given emissions intensity target could be satisfied with a range of emissions and output combinations.

230,Energy transition in Germany: a case study on a policy-driven structural change of the energy system,"The German energy transition (“Energiewende”), i.e., shifting the basis of the energy system from fossil and nuclear fuels to renewable energy constitutes a policy-driven structural change of the energy systems. The fundamental political decisions on nuclear phase-out and the deep decarbonisation of the energy system were based on specific risk considerations in German society, formed by political and learning processes over more than two decades, including the experiences made with the roll-out of renewable energies from 1990 to 2010 that created significant technology optimism in this field. The major challenges for the energy transition do not arise from technological issues or the system costs of a renewables-based system if the once-only investments in innovation are taken into account (that contributed significantly to the massive cost decrease of wind and solar energy at global level). Structural challenges arise first from the dominance of variable renewable energies, which changes generation patterns and shifts cost structures to high shares of capital and low or even zero marginal costs. This triggers the need for restructured power market design that enables price-based system coordination as well as the payback of investments in a low marginal cost environment and re-adjusts the cost allocation among the different consumer groups. Second, the increasing diversity in the power system brings in a broad range of new players and new economic appraisals (self-generation, etc.) that also requires—beyond new dimensions of coordination—structural changes in the regulatory framework. Third, the spatial patterns of the electricity system necessitate large-scale structural changes in the network infrastructures, which demand a sensitive reflection of public acceptance and network regulation approaches. A successful energy transition beyond its present stage requires stringent and holistic policy approaches that are based on four pillars: paving the way for clean energy, designing the exit game for the high-carbon assets, triggering the network infrastructures and making innovation work in time.",2017-06-01,10.1007/s40844-016-0066-x,"['Matthes, Felix Christian']",Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40844-016-0066-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
231,Germany’s Energy Supply,"Deutschland verfügt nur über sehr begrenzte heimische Energieressourcen. 70 % des Primärenergiebedarfs müssen durch Importe gedeckt werden. Die Märkte für Energie sind durch eine breite Vielfalt und eine große Anbieterzahl gekennzeichnet. Auf dem Ölmarkt herrscht bereits seit Jahrzehnten intensiver Wettbewerb. Braunkohle und Steinkohle sind einer scharfen Substitutionskonkurrenz vor allem mit Erdgas ausgesetzt. Der Erdgas- und der Strommarkt wurden 1998 vollständig liberalisiert. Die Verbraucher können zwischen einer Vielzahl von Lieferanten frei wählen. Seit Beginn dieses Jahrhundert haben allerdings staatliche Eingriffe vor allem in den Strommarkt zugenommen. Der Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien wird seit dem Jahr 2000 durch Einspeisevorrang und gesetzlich geregelte Einspeisevergütungen gefördert. Die 2011 eingeleitete Energiewende ist durch ambitionierte energie- und klimapolitische Ziele gekennzeichnet. Zentrale Eckpfeiler sind die Umwandlung der Stromversorgung von einer auf konventionellen Energien basierenden Erzeugung in ein hauptsächlich auf erneuerbare Energien gestütztes System bei gleichzeitig drastischen Vorgaben zur Steigerung der Energieeffizienz und den weltweit wohl ambitioniertesten Zielen zum Klimaschutz. Beim Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien und beim Ausstieg aus der Kernenergie bewegt sich Deutschland auf dem Zielpfad. Demgegenüber zeichnet sich bisher noch nicht ab, dass die angestrebten Ziele zur Senkung des Primärenergieverbrauchs und zur Minderung der Treibhausgas-Emissionen erreicht werden. Germany has only very limited domestic energy resources. Seventy percent of primary energy needs must be covered by imports. The markets for energy are marked by a wide diversity and a large number of providers. The oil market has been intensely competitive for decades now. Lignite and hard coal are subjected to fierce substitution competition, especially with natural gas. The natural gas and electricity markets were fully liberalized in 1998. Consumers can freely choose from a vast number of suppliers. Since the beginning of this century, however, state interference particularly in the electricity market has increased. The expansion of renewables has been promoted since the year 2000 by feed-in priority and feed-in remunerations regulated by the state. The energy transition initiated in 2011 is characterized by ambitious energy and climate policy targets. Key pillars include the conversion of electricity generation from production on the basis of conventional energy sources to a system based mainly on renewable energies combined with stringent requirements designed to enhance energy efficiency and what are probably the most ambitious climate protection targets worldwide. As regards the expansion of renewables and the phase-out of nuclear energy, Germany is keeping to its target path.

232,Energy efficiency policy governance in a multi-level administration structure — evidence from Germany,"The German government has proclaimed energy efficiency to be the ‘first imperative’ for the transformation of the energy system (‘Energiewende’). It has enacted numerous policy measures at federal, federal state and local level which combined should deliver the aspired energy savings. Our contribution reviews the German governance system (multi-level policy coordination and policy feedback through monitoring and verification of energy savings), including the full set of German Sustainable Energy Action Plans (SEAPs). We find that many of the SEAPs put emphasis on CO_2 reduction but neglect a systematic monitoring and verification (M&V) of energy efficiency. A harmonised M&V scheme covering the relevant energy aggregates and energy savings can facilitate policy feedback. Designing the M&V system to the principle of cost-effectiveness can help to save costs and keep information provision and administrative burden in balance. Regarding policy coordination, the German case shows that strong formal coordination structures are a necessary condition for effective policy design, but not a sufficient one. They need to be backed up by informal coordination such as feedback loops or sharing of best practices to add a dynamic dimension.",2017-06-01,10.1007/s12053-016-9484-1,"['Ringel, Marc']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12053-016-9484-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
233,Adaptation strategies for mitigating agricultural GHG emissions under dual-level uncertainties with the consideration of global warming impacts,"Agriculture plays a central role in maintaining food security and achieving sustainable development for human society. It is a challenge for the agricultural sector to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and maintain agricultural production. However, dual-level uncertainties exist in the processes of agricultural GHG accounting and emission reduction management. In this research, an integrated approach for identifying adaptation strategies in agricultural GHG emission reduction management was developed through incorporating life cycle analysis (LCA) of agricultural production into a general mathematical programming model. This approach strengthened the applicability of LCA and the comprehensiveness of programming models in generating agricultural adaptive actions under different GHG emission restriction targets. Also, dual-level uncertainties of LCA and adaptation management can be effectively addressed. A case study was proposed to illustrate application of the approach in Dalian City, China. The results indicated that farming patterns in eight districts would change significantly. The total area of maize fields would account for the primary proportion (i.e., 40–45 %) in its agricultural sector. Rice, peanut and cabbage fields would be the minor contributors in terms of GHG emissions. In addition to effective rainfall (i.e., [156, 259] mm/ha), a certain amount of water would be supplied for agricultural irrigation to maximize the city’s agricultural yields. Compared with other agricultural crops, rice fields would need the largest amount of irrigation water (i.e., [153.72, 277.98] Mt) to meet the requirements of local government plans.",2017-05-01,10.1007/s00477-016-1244-4,"['Yue, Wencong', 'Cai, Yanpeng', 'Xu, Linyu', 'Tan, Qian', 'Yin, Xin’An']",Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00477-016-1244-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
234,Protein futures for Western Europe: potential land use and climate impacts in 2050,"Multiple production and demand side measures are needed to improve food system sustainability. This study quantified the theoretical minimum agricultural land requirements to supply Western Europe with food in 2050 from its own land base, together with GHG emissions arising. Assuming that crop yield gaps in agriculture are closed, livestock production efficiencies increased and waste at all stages reduced, a range of food consumption scenarios were modelled each based on different ‘protein futures’. The scenarios were as follows: intensive and efficient livestock production using today’s species mix; intensive efficient poultry–dairy production; intensive efficient aquaculture–dairy; artificial meat and dairy; livestock on ‘ecological leftovers’ (livestock reared only on land unsuited to cropping, agricultural residues and food waste, with consumption capped at that level of availability); and a ‘plant-based eating’ scenario. For each scenario, ‘projected diet’ and ‘healthy diet’ variants were modelled. Finally, we quantified the theoretical maximum carbon sequestration potential from afforestation of spared agricultural land. Results indicate that land use could be cut by 14–86 % and GHG emissions reduced by up to approximately 90 %. The yearly carbon storage potential arising from spared agricultural land ranged from 90 to 700 Mt CO_2 in 2050. The artificial meat and plant-based scenarios achieved the greatest land use and GHG reductions and the greatest carbon sequestration potential. The ‘ecological leftover’ scenario required the least cropland as compared with the other meat-containing scenarios, but all available pasture was used, and GHG emissions were higher if meat consumption was not capped at healthy levels.",2017-02-01,10.1007/s10113-016-1013-4,"['Röös, Elin', 'Bajželj, Bojana', 'Smith, Pete', 'Patel, Mikaela', 'Little, David', 'Garnett, Tara']",Regional Environmental Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10113-016-1013-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
235,Implications of an energy efficiency obligation scheme for the Swedish energy-intensive industries: an evaluation of costs and benefits,The EU Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) aims at improving energy efficiency by implementing actions in all sectors of the economy in the EU. Article 7 of the EED sets the target of 1.5 % cumulative annual energy end-use savings. An energy efficiency obligation scheme (EEO) is one of the policy mechanisms proposed to reach this target. This paper assesses the impact of implementing a Swedish EEO and the implications that such a scheme may have for Swedish energy-intensive industries. The assessment was based on cost-benefit analysis (CBA) methodology. The benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) ranges from 1.56 to 2.17 and the break-even cost ranges from 83.3 to 86.9 €/MWh with sensitivity analyses performed for the emission allowance prices and eventual costs of the EEO. The annual energy savings potential is estimated to be 1.25 TWh/year. A Swedish EEO could motivate investments in energy efficiency measures and thus help Sweden reach the energy efficiency targets set in the EED.,2017-02-01,10.1007/s12053-016-9446-7,"['Xylia, Maria', 'Silveira, Semida', 'Morfeldt, Johannes']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12053-016-9446-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

We find that during the last 50 years, global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions released from beef cattle, pork and chickens increased by 59 %, 89 % and 461 % respectively. In 2010, GHG emissions caused by beef cattle contributed 54 % of total livestock emissions; pork and chickens contribute to 5–1 %, respectively. In the same year, the methane emissions released from beef cattle represent about 69 % of total emissions associated with that livestock category, in particular due to methane emissions from enteric fermentation. Although beef cattle and pork emissions increased during the period 1961–2010, their respective per capita emissions decreased over the time (−29 % and −15 %, respectively).

From 2005 onward, in particular, the volume and significance of different carbon emission trading schemes have increased spectacularly; despite the fact that new emission trading schemes are appearing, the value of the market had fallen by the end of the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period in 2012. One fundamental reason for this was the uncertainty as to whether a new global agreement or protocol would be reached in 2015. The main goal of this chapter is to offer an overview of International Emission Trading under the Kyoto Protocol together with the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), as the schemes at the core of today’s carbon markets, exploring their basic structure, their main links, and their differences, including a carbon price analysis underlining their fundamental weaknesses and strengths.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_57,"['Alegría, Itziar Martínez', 'Molina, Gonzalo', 'Río, Belén']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_57,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
241,Emissions Trading,"Climate change is being exacerbated by the emissions of globe-warming greenhouse gases (GHGs) as a consequence of economic activities associated with energy, industry, transportation, and land use. From an economic viewpoint, the Earth’s climate is a public good , and pollution a negative externality ; such change therefore constitutes market failure . Controlling air pollution by utilizing economic mechanisms represents an important change in environmental thinking – literally a paradigm shift away from historical command-and-control engineering systems. Today, this approach is being utilized to mitigate the emissions of GHGs, addressing the pollution externality by putting a price on carbon. The international carbon market, largely developed as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, had a total value of $176 billion in 2011, but it has decreased significantly in recent years. With the addition of China and other national and subnational programs, however, it is expected that it will once again increase, as a larger and larger portion of emitted GHGs come under such regulatory purview. Historically, the largest component of that market has been the European Union’s Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which represents a regional market designed first to assist Europe in achieving compliance with the Protocol’s requirements, and now is a cornerstone of the EU’s policy to combat climate change. It also has links to the Protocol’s project-based mechanisms, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI), which help minimize compliance costs. China’s nascent market – currently seven pilot schemes, but expected to become a national program in 2016 – should ultimately become twice as large as the EU ETS. Other carbon markets created in numerous countries (e.g., the U.S., Japan, South Korea, etc.) as well as a voluntary market are also expected to make significant contributions. This chapter discusses the structure of these emissions trading carbon markets, the theory behind their development, their historical evolution, ongoing governance challenges, and future prospects.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_8,"['Raufer, Roger', 'Coussy, Paula', 'Freeman, Carla', 'Iyer, Sudha']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
242,Approaches to the Exchange of Mitigation Outcomes,"Climate literature and policy typically differentiate between carbon markets and carbon taxation as the two main approaches to pricing carbon and subsequent ‘exchange’ of mitigation outcomes. Additional approaches, such as bilateral direct exchanges between parties or climate-related quantitative easing, have been discussed over time. A clear distinction between these approaches has been maintained to ‘safeguard’ their independence. Yet, the correlated fragmentation of policies addressing climate change has led to high degrees of uncertainty regarding their aggregate efficacy. By introducing a single mechanism to certify mitigation outcomes, the Mitigation Alliance (MA) helps converge previously separated approaches towards a common objective without limiting flexibility. As a consequence, the MA provides its members with a significant variety of policy, strategy and action options concerning the exchange of mitigation outcomes, while guaranteeing harmonisation and consistency with its holistic architecture. Organising the exchange approaches into three macro-typologies (market, non-market and hybrid), the Chapter outlines the MA’s multi-level, hybrid governance model.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-54699-5_7,"['Stua, Michele']",From the Paris Agreement to a Low-Carbon Bretton Woods,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-54699-5_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

The Chapter therefore exposes the economic theory of carbon markets as an efficient policy to address this problem. The chapter concludes with an explanation of the way that the European Union has implemented a carbon market since 2005 and how the policy has evolved since.

244,Climate Clubs and Their Relevance Within the Paris Agreement,"As diplomatic crisis threatened to overwhelm the negotiations for an international regime on climate change, certain new theoretical climate policy models began to gain a foothold in international debate. Hypotheses for smaller scale negotiations based upon a reduced number of actors, as well as the idea of ‘minilateral’ clubs of cooperating countries taking the lead in acting against climate change, quickly spread among scholars and policy makers, leading several commentators to view them as possible ‘last stance’ solutions in case the international climate negotiations failed. The Paris Agreement breakthrough, hailed by most as the ultimate victory of ‘multilateralism’, eventually overtook any minilateral ambition, at least concerning the climate bargaining process. Nevertheless, the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Paris Agreement’s ambitious objectives may represent a window of opportunity for a specific category of ‘minilateral’ models, known as ‘transformational clubs’, to find their own significant space within the new international climate regime. While describing the general characteristics of climate clubs and the specific features of ‘transformational clubs’, this Chapter discusses to what extent these latter may effectively play a role in the future developments of the international debate on climate change.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-54699-5_3,"['Stua, Michele']",From the Paris Agreement to a Low-Carbon Bretton Woods,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-54699-5_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

246,Emission trading for air pollution hot spots: getting the permit market right,"Conventional emission permit markets are inefficient for non-uniformly mixed pollutants that create geographic ‘hot spots’ of different ambient emission concentrations and environmental damage. Economically efficient ambient concentration contribution markets involve difficult interactions among multiple markets that makes them practically infeasible. Extending economic theory by Muller and Mendelsohn (Am Econ Rev 99(5):1714–1739, 2009 . doi: 10.1257/aer.99.5.1714 ) and others about ‘getting the prices right’ through bilateral trading ratios, this paper introduces theoretical simplifications and a novel type of single permit market with a hybrid price-quantity instrument that addresses the dual heterogeneity of firm-specific abatement costs and regional variation in damage. This paper shows how to ‘get the market right’ robustly through simplicity, liquidity, and gradualism.

250,Transformation of Economic Systems: The Bio-Economy Case,"To improve sustainability, the global economic system has to undergo severe transformation processes. This chapter deals with the possibility of an innovation-triggered transformation towards a knowledge-based bioeconomy, which is supposed to overcome the current lock-in into a fossil fuel-based CO_2-intensive production. To do this, a Neo-Schumpeterian view is applied that highlights the complex interplay in knowledge-generation and -diffusion processes between firms, consumers and government institutions. By applying the Neo-Schumpeterian approach it becomes obvious that innovation and economic growth are part of the solution and not part of the sustainability problem. The shift from quantitative growth—prevailing in textbook economics—to qualitative development—prevailing in Neo-Schumpeterian economics—makes the difference and affects all agents and institutions in an economic system, which needs to be designed as a dedicated innovation system supporting the transformation towards a knowledge-based bioeconomy.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-58374-7_1,"['Pyka, Andreas']",Knowledge-Driven Developments in the Bioeconomy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-58374-7_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
251,“Monetary” rules for a linked system of offset credits,"Three dominant issues have historically plagued climate negotiations: How to bypass issues of sovereignty, generate sufficient climate finance, and establish an agreement that is inclusive of the current major polluters. These issues are prevalent within the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol, and the CDM has provided policy makers with a useful starting point to understanding how offset credits can be utilised within a post-Kyoto framework. The primary aim of this research is to investigate how project-based offset credits generated by states would interact within a linked framework using monetary rules and exchange rates. The examination of a linked system, specifically, was owing to the structure of the proposed agreement to be finalised in Paris at COP 21 where nationally determined contributions would be submitted by each state, allowing for the possibility of linked domestic carbon market mechanisms. The certified emission reduction credits of the CDM were used as a model to investigate the trade of offset credits within a linked system which act as a unique climate currency of each domestic offset credit mechanism. These offset credits could be earned through the implementation of domestic projects or projects hosted in other states. From this research, we conclude that fixed exchange rates are more stable than flexible exchange rates in a climate currency framework. Fixed exchange rates reduce losses of capital (owing to uncertainty in the markets) and the prominence of asymmetric spatial price transmission associated with fiat offset credit prices. To encourage co-operation between developing and developed countries, it is recommended that a combination of currency area theory and trade blocs be implemented as opposed to a currency union. Currency areas are the most viable option as they maintain that the domestic offset credit mechanism is under the control of the state and retains a level of stability as individual state offset credit prices are fixed to the same price. Even though this research forms the basis for a new climate policy architecture, the overall effectiveness of the policy will be determined by the selection of appropriate discount schemes, increased participation and agreement by states, and most significantly, political will.",2016-12-01,10.1007/s10784-015-9312-7,"['Pillay, Kamleshan', 'Viñuales, Jorge E.']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-015-9312-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
252,Prolonged international environmental negotiations: the roles and strategies of non-state actors in the EU,"For scholars of international environmental agreements, the role of non-state actors has been a central focus. There is a considerable literature on the influence of environmental NGOs and business groups on state behaviour and in turn international environmental outcomes. However, much less empirical work has been done to examine the influence of these actors and the strategies they can use in prolonged international environmental negotiations that last for years or decades. This article takes up this task. Drawing on a rich empirical data set on the role of European-based actors in the international climate change negotiations, it considers the influence of non-state actors in prolonged negotiations and identifies four strategies that these actors can use to influence state actors and non-state actors alike.",2016-10-01,10.1007/s10784-015-9292-7,"['Downie, Christian']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-015-9292-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
253,Influence of DNA isolation method on the investigation of archaeal diversity and abundance in biogas plants,"Various methods are available for DNA isolation from environmental samples. Because the chemical and biological composition of samples such as soil, sludge, or plant material is different, the effectiveness of DNA isolation can vary depending on the method applied and thus, have a substantial effect on the results of downstream analysis of the microbial community. Although the process of biogas formation is being intensely investigated, a systematic evaluation of kits for DNA isolation from material of biogas plants is still lacking. Since no DNA isolation kit specifically tailored for DNA isolation from sludge of biogas plants is available, this study compares five commercially available kits regarding their influence on downstream analyses such denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The results show that not all kits are equally suited for the DNA isolation from samples of different biogas plants, but highly reproducible DGGE fingerprints as well as qPCR results across the tested samples from biogas reactors using different substrate compositions could be produced using selected kits.",2016-09-01,10.1007/s00203-016-1221-9,"['Theiss, Juliane', 'Rother, Michael', 'Röske, Kerstin']",Archives of Microbiology,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00203-016-1221-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
254,The globalization of the carbon market: Welfare and competitiveness effects of linking emissions trading schemes,"In the light of the prevailing goal to keep global temperature increase below 2° and recent challenges to reach a global climate agreement in the near term, linking emissions trading schemes has emerged as a prominent complementing policy option. To this end, we explicitly assess (1) the macroeconomic welfare impacts and (2) the trade-based competitiveness effects of linking the European Union (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme in the year 2020. A stylized partial market analysis suggests that, independently of regional cost characteristics, the integration of emissions trading schemes (ETS) yields economic welfare gains for all participating regions. A computable general equilibrium analysis confirms these findings at the macroeconomic level: The economic efficiency losses from emissions regulation are diminished for both EU Member States and non-EU regions by linking ETS. However, the quantitative analysis suggests opposite trade-based incentives for linking up: while EU Member States improve their terms of trade by integrating with emerging ETS, non-EU linking candidates face competitiveness losses by linking. We conclude that, for non-EU regions, the attractiveness of linking ETS is a matter of priorities for economic welfare or international competitiveness. If these priorities are hierarchized in favor of welfare, the globalization of the carbon market could become a promising policy option complementing the efforts to reach a global climate agreement in 2015.",2016-08-01,10.1007/s11027-014-9631-y,"['Alexeeva, Victoria', 'Anger, Niels']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-014-9631-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
255,The socialization potential of the CDM in EU–China climate relations,"This article hypothesizes that the material incentives associated with the clean development mechanism (CDM) have contributed to the internalization of climate protection norms in China. In current academic research, the CDM has both been extolled as a cost-effective and vilified as an environmentally and ethically inadequate climate mitigation instrument. Few studies so far, however, have looked into the CDM’s potential contribution to socialization-related phenomena such as raising climate change awareness in emerging economies. The relationship with the EU is highly relevant in this context, as the emission reduction credits (CERs) resulting from CDM projects would not have had any meaningful prices without the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). This article aims to fill the current research gap by studying the socialization potential of the CDM in EU–China climate relations in four periods, namely initiation (2001–2005), improvement (2005–2007), consolidation (2008–2010) and habit formation (2010–2014).

256,Linking the emissions trading schemes of Europe and China - Combining climate and energy policy instruments,"Both Europe and China have announced targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and renewable energy development. To achieve their emissions targets, Europe has introduced emissions trading scheme (ETS) since 2005 and China has planned to establish a national ETS in 2015. We assess the impact of a joint Europe-China ETS when both climate and energy policy instruments are simulated in a multiregional general equilibrium model. Our results show that a joint ETS markedly increases total carbon emissions from fossil fuels even though global mitigation costs are reduced. Moreover, a joint ETS helps China achieve its renewable energy target, but for Europe, it works opposite. While the renewable energy target does not help Europe achieve additional abatement, the renewable energy target in China reduces mitigation costs and emissions, and increases renewable energy consumption and sales of carbon allowances. Financial transfer through a joint ETS remains marginal compared to China’s demand for renewable energy subsidies. We conclude that as long as an absolute emissions cap is missing in China, a joint ETS is not attractive for mitigation and China’s renewable energy target can reduce emissions.",2016-02-01,10.1007/s11027-014-9580-5,"['Liu, Yang', 'Wei, Taoyuan']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-014-9580-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
257,The Case of German Bioenergy Policy,"This chapter provides an overview of relevant political framework conditions for German bioenergy policy. European and national policy levels are focused on, because it is here that major incentives for bioenergy use originate. It is shown that bioenergy policy affects a wide range of policy aims from diverse policy areas, and that the political prioritisation of aims has changed over time. Furthermore, there is a complex mix of policy instruments that influence bioenergy allocation decisions. Instruments identified as the most relevant for bioenergy allocation include command-and-control instruments and market-based incentive instruments, which can be further divided into indirect instruments which increase the costs of fossil fuel substitutes and direct instruments which set positive incentives for bioenergy use. Direct, sectoral instruments such as the Renewable Energy Sources Act in the electricity sector, the Renewable Energy Heat Act and the Market Incentive Programme in the heating sector, and the biofuels quota in the transport sector are the most relevant policy drivers for bioenergy expansion in Germany. Moreover, the chapter assesses the German bioenergy policy mix in relation to the market and government failures discussed in Chap. 2 , and reviews major strands of critique in the public debate. The chapter concludes with a review of recommendations for reforming the German bioenergy policy mix, to allow for a comparison to the NIE-based policy advice developed in this book.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-31135-7_4,"['Purkus, Alexandra']",Concepts and Instruments for a Rational Bioenergy Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-31135-7_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

259,Implications of Economic Theory for Bioenergy Policy Design,"The chapter “Implications of Economic Theory for Bioenergy Policy Design” develops the analytical framework which is used in Chap. 5 to derive recommendations for German bioenergy policy. First, neoclassical theory implications for bioenergy policy, as well as their limits, are discussed. To move towards more realistic theory-based policy recommendations, the analysis draws on the theory of second-best, information economics, the theory of economic order, and new institutional economics, and gives an outlook on ecological economics implications. For each of these theories, relevant findings are applied to bioenergy policy, leading to the derivation of theoretical guidelines for bioenergy policy design. It is demonstrated that a combination of theoretical approaches is necessary to generate recommendations which adequately reflect the complexity of the bioenergy policy problem. However, among the theories considered, new institutional economics approaches are found to be particularly fruitful. Here, the matrix of institutions which jointly influence allocation decisions by bioenergy actors is at the centre of the policy analysis. Among new institutional economics approaches, transaction cost and contract economics, the principal-agent approach, the theory of institutional change, and the public choice approach provide valuable insights for generating policy design recommendations in the presence of uncertainty, transaction costs, path dependencies and political feasibility constraints. Because of the advantages that an institutional perspective offers for the analysis of bioenergy policy, new institutional economics is chosen as the overall framework into which insights from other theories are integrated.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-31135-7_3,"['Purkus, Alexandra']",Concepts and Instruments for a Rational Bioenergy Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-31135-7_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
260,"The U.S. Proposed Carbon Tariffs, WTO Scrutiny and China’s Responses","To date, border carbon adjustment measures in the form of emissions allowance requirements (EAR) under the U.S. proposed cap-and-trade regime are the most concrete unilateral trade measure put forward to level the carbon playing field, and the U.S. EAR clearly targets major emerging economies, such as China. If improperly implemented, such measures could disturb the world trade order and trigger a trade war. Because of these potentially far-reaching impacts, this paper analyzes trade policy implications of the proposed EAR, and China’s responses. Scrutinizing the U.S. EAR against WTO provisions and case laws, the paper recommends what is to be done on the side of the U.S. to minimize the potential conflicts with WTO provisions in designing its BCA measures, and provides suggestions for China on how to effectively deal them to its advantage while being targeted by such proposed measures. The paper has argued that there is a clear need within a climate regime to define comparable efforts towards climate mitigation and adaptation to discipline the use of unilateral trade measures at the international level, and shows that defining the comparability of climate efforts can be to China’s advantage, and questions China’s same stance on this issue as India’s.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-29322-6_3,"['Zhang, ZhongXiang']",Legal Issues on Climate Change and International Trade Law,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-29322-6_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
261,Taiwan’s Climate Change Mitigation Policies and Their Potential Interaction with the WTO Rules: Focusing on Economic Incentive Measures,"Taiwan makes no small contribution to the increasing global greenhouse gases emissions due to its industrial and economic structure. According to the statistics published by the International Energy Agency, Taiwan ranks 21st world-wide and 12th in Asia in terms of CO_2 emissions per capita in 2011. On the other hand, as an island state that is prone to natural disasters such as typhoons and earthquakes, Taiwan is particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change.

Important events include the onset of the financial crisis, the related build-up of an allowance surplus and a falling carbon price, a reform process launched in 2012 including temporary (backloading) and structural reform options, a nadir reached in spring 2013 when Parliament rejected backloading, the Commission then launching the Market Stability Reserve option with momentum increasing and the MSR adopted in spring 2015, followed by a complete ETS reform proposal.",2016-01-01,10.1057/978-1-137-56674-4_4,"['Wettestad, Jørgen', 'Jevnaker, Torbjørg']",Rescuing EU Emissions Trading,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/978-1-137-56674-4_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
263,The US Says No While the Carbon Market Moves Forward,"Rosenzweig describes actions taken by President Bush and the international community during 2000–2008. These include the US decision to reject Kyoto and failure to take action to reduce GHG emissions. The chapter elaborates the emerging cap-and-trade debate, a Supreme Court decision that provided the impetus for future US policy, and bottom-up policy-making efforts. Internationally, Rosenzweig charts the evolution of the policies that created the carbon markets, including the creation of the EU ETS, the CDM rules, and Kyoto’s entry into force. A summary of early market activity is provided. And to illustrate how the markets worked, he provides a synopsis of three CDM deals completed by Natsource and one that failed.",2016-01-01,10.1057/978-1-137-56051-3_3,"['Rosenzweig, Richard H.']",Global Climate Change Policy and Carbon Markets,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/978-1-137-56051-3_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
264,Principles of Rulemaking,"In a democracy, when a rule is made within the jurisdiction of a country, it could either be made as a direct or indirect import from a treaty or international norm, or a sui generis rule stemming from an exigency faced by that country. The former could be exemplified by any significant event, such as the earthquake in Ecuador of April 2016 or the attacks in the United States of 11 September 2011. In the latter instance the Attorney General of the United States made several rules in responses to the attacks directed at the conduct of citizens and suspects. In the air transport context, a good example is the principle enunciated by the Montreal Convention of 1999, Article 19 of which states that the carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo. The provision goes on to say that nevertheless, the carrier is not liable for damage occasioned by delay if it proves that it and its servants and agents took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for it or them to take such measures. The normative sense of this treaty provision has been made into Regulation 261 of 2004 by The European Parliament and the European Council and judicially interpreted by The European Court of Justice. In essence Regulation 261/2004 elaborates on Article 19 of the Montreal Convention, which is what rulemaking is all about, in that States could take a recognized international norm and adopt rules and regulations to comport with special exigencies and social mores of their internal requirements and principles of justice.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-44657-8_4,"['Abeyratne, Ruwantissa']",Rulemaking in Air Transport,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-44657-8_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
265,Making Allowances for Carbon Emission Allowances in Investor-State Disputes: A Case Study of the Republic of Korea,"On December 2, 2014, the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea passed the two ratification bills for Korea-Australia and Korea-Canada free trade agreements (FTAs) containing investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions soon after the end of trade negotiations with the two Pacific Rim partners, regardless of an on-going multi-billion dollar ISDS claim initiated by the Lone Star Funds—an American private equity firm—against the Korean government (LSF-KEB Holdings SCA and others 2012), invoking similar ISDS provisions provided in another investment treaty with the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union (Korea-Belgium/Luxembourg BIT 2006). In fact, this claim placed Korea for the first time as a respondent State in known ISDS cases (UNCTAD 2013). Such a bipartisan support to the proposed bills resembles that of the National Assembly in May 2012 when its members passed the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) bill almost unanimously with only 3 abstentions and placed Korea as the first Asian country to initiate an ETS (International Emissions Trading Association 2013), despite the fact that the ETS of the European Union (EU), the largest carbon trading market, revealed its serious loopholes in its trial period. Interestingly enough, the two FTAs and the Korean Emissions Trading Scheme (KETS) came into effect concurrently from January 2015.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-29322-6_6,"['Park, Deok-Young', 'Yoon, Yonjong']",Legal Issues on Climate Change and International Trade Law,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-29322-6_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
266,The German Energiewende in a European Context,"German energy and climate policies are influenced, supported, and constrained by neighboring states and the European Union (EU). There is a fairly stable consensus in Europe about the importance of a low-carbon energy transition and in expanding renewable energy production. As Germany is Europe’s economic powerhouse, no energy transition in Europe is possible if Germany does not succeed in its own transition. The challenge for Germany and Europe is in providing the right incentives and structures to propel their energy transitions. The transformations will require not only technological innovations and engineering solutions, but also an appropriate policy framework and public understanding and acceptance. The challenge is complicated by the different energy endowments, economic levels, industrial interests, and political coalitions in the different member states.",2016-01-01,10.1057/978-1-137-44288-8_4,"['Schreurs, Miranda A.']",Germany's Energy Transition,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/978-1-137-44288-8_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
267,The End of Climate Change 1.0 Internationally,"Rosenzweig details the turbulence in the EU ETS market and the CDM from 2008–2012, which contributed to the end of the first generation of international climate change policy. In the EU ETS market, an enormous surplus took hold, causing falling prices. And because the EU was the largest buyer of CDM credits, demand and prices plummeted for them. Rosenzweig describes the reasons for this, analyzes the markets’ performance, while also assessing the KP. He concludes that although each market’s performance was caused by unique dynamics, their failure also resulted from common characteristics. Rosenzweig argues that the demise of these top-down systems resulted from their inability to learn, adapt to new information, and respond to problems.",2016-01-01,10.1057/978-1-137-56051-3_4,"['Rosenzweig, Richard H.']",Global Climate Change Policy and Carbon Markets,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/978-1-137-56051-3_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

Although the system was successfully launched in 2005, the first years of functioning saw several problems, with a volatile carbon price and individual member-states implementing the system differently. This led to ‘revolutionary’ changes for the 2013–20 phase adopted as part of the climate and energy package in 2008, with a more centralized, auction-based system.

271,Linking Emission Trading Schemes,"This chapter investigates linking Emission Trading Schemes (ETSs) as a possible option to increase the effectiveness of the existing domestic or regional regimes and overcome the difficulties encountered in recent years by international climate change negotiations. For this purpose, the drivers and different types of possible linking arrangements are analysed along with their pros and cons, and the “necessary and optional features” for a successful linking are proposed. Building on this analysis, the chapter proposes three selected options for linking ETSs, aiming at enlarging the scope of the existing domestic/regional regimes, ranging from multilateralism to bilateralism. Finally, particular attention is devoted to the proposal recently set forth by the World Bank of a system of “globally networked carbon markets”, which goes beyond the linking agreements planned, proposed and/or implemented so far.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-31186-9_4,"['Borghesi, Simone', 'Montini, Massimiliano', 'Barreca, Alessandra']",The European Emission Trading System and Its Followers,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-31186-9_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
272,Introduction,"Hailed as the cornerstone and flagship of EU climate policy, the Emissions Trading System (ETS) covers almost half of the EU’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Internal agreement on the development of this flagship is essential to achieving the EU’s decarbonization ambitions. In 2013 the ETS was in severe crisis, with a huge surplus of allowances and a sagging carbon price. Even a formally simple measure for changing the timing of auctioning was rejected by the European Parliament. Yet, only two years later, the fundamental Market Stability reserve measure was adopted, with proposals for total ETS overhaul. How was it possible to turn the flagship around so quickly? This book utilizes close study of background documents and fresh interviews to narrate the fascinating story.",2016-01-01,10.1057/978-1-137-56674-4_1,"['Wettestad, Jørgen', 'Jevnaker, Torbjørg']",Rescuing EU Emissions Trading,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/978-1-137-56674-4_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
273,"Sustainability—A Long, Hard Road","Sustainability—a term compromising a group of themes and being of immense importance for today’s and all future generations. It has developed in last decades to one of the most central concepts in environmental law and poses an important component of political and juridical aims. The Treaty of Amsterdam implemented sustainability in primary law as a basic objective of the European Union. As a consequence, the EU established the Sustainable Development Strategy (EU SDS) with the aim to improve the living situation of all generations. Also on a national level, many measures have been taken to enhance the “sustainable development” approach. But one has to ask the question: does the concept of sustainability work? Do the measures taken, inter alia, in the fields of transport, energy, climate change and waste management lead to the desired success or is it just a sublime goal, a program without (sufficient) implementation? Or is it even just a tokenism?",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-26021-1_4,"['Kerschner, Ferdinand', 'Wagner, Erika']",Legal Aspects of Sustainable Development,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-26021-1_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

Particular attention is devoted to the specific features underlying the legal and economic design of the systems, including the GHG being covered and the sectors involved, the allocation mechanisms, the evolution of the carbon pricing and the subsequent revisions of the EU ETS (e.g. the NER300 programme and the back-loading mechanism) that have been implemented to face some of the problems encountered so far.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-31186-9_1,"['Borghesi, Simone', 'Montini, Massimiliano', 'Barreca, Alessandra']",The European Emission Trading System and Its Followers,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-31186-9_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
275,Conclusions,"The book’s conclusions summarise the major findings, discuss the transferability of the study’s analytical framework to other policy contexts, and provide an outlook. The study develops recommendations for a rational bioenergy policy, which strives for efficiency and sustainability under constraints imposed by interacting market failures and government failures, while acknowledging the likely non-optimality of outcomes. This approach highlights the necessity of identifying solutions for a rational handling of uncertainty in policy making; moreover, in order to ensure the practical relevance of recommendations, political feasibility considerations have to be taken into account. Parallels between the German bioenergy policy mix and bioenergy policies of other EU and non-EU countries ensure the relevance of case study results for other institutional contexts. Furthermore, with adjustments, the analytical framework can be transferred to other problems of environmental policy making where multiple market failures meet multiple risks of government failures, and uncertainties associated with the environmental costs and benefits of measures are high, such as the emerging field of bioeconomy policy.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-31135-7_6,"['Purkus, Alexandra']",Concepts and Instruments for a Rational Bioenergy Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-31135-7_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

277,Multi-Objective Optimization and Multi-Criteria Analysis Models and Methods for Problems in the Energy Sector,"The energy sector has been a fertile ground for the application of operational research (OR) models and methods (Antunes and Martins, OR Models for Energy Policy, Planning and Management, Annals of Operational Research, vols. 120/121, 2003). Even though different concerns have been present in OR models to assess the merit of potential solutions for a broad range of problems arising in the energy sector, the use of multi-objective optimization (MOO) and multi-criteria analysis (MCA) approaches is more recent, dating back from mid-late 1970s. The need to consider explicitly multiple uses of water resource systems or environmental aspects in energy planning provided the main motivation for the use of MOO and MCA models and methods with a special evidence in scientific literature since the 1980s. The increasing need to account for sustainability issues, which is inherently a multi-criteria concept, in planning and operational decisions, the changes in the organization of energy markets, the conflicting views of several stakeholders, the prevalent uncertainty associated with energy models, have made MOO and MCA approaches indispensable to deal with complex and challenging problems in the energy sector. This paper aims at providing an overview of MOO and MCA models and methods in a vast range of energy problems, namely in the electricity sector, which updates and extends the one in Diakoulaki etal.

Broadly, models and methods dealing with multi-objective mathematical programming and a priori explicitly known discrete alternatives are distinguished and some of the main types of problems are stated. The main conclusion is that MOO and MCA approaches are essential for a thorough analysis of energy problems at different decision levels, from strategic to operational, and with different timeframes.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4939-3094-4_25,"['Antunes, Carlos Henggeler', 'Henriques, Carla Oliveira']",Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-3094-4_25,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

280,Public Policies and the Energy Mix in Italy: Where Do We Stand?,"Given the almost complete energy dependency and the consequently high sensitiveness to energy security in Italy, energy efficiency and a significant renewable share in the national energy mix are key goals of energy policy. Although the energy intensity of the Italian economy is among the lowest in western countries, there is room for further improvements pursuing economic growth without increasing the energy use (decoupling). Indeed the high Italian energy efficiency has been stimulated by import dependence and relatively high energy prices, because the economic system proved to be very reactive to selective price incentives towards energy products. Notwithstanding these premises, the general coherence and efficacy of the current framework—a bundle of excise taxes, direct subsidies, feed-in tariffs and tax expenditure together with the launch of an auction-based ETS phase—is highly questionable. Therefore, a progressive evolution of support mechanisms for renewable and energy efficiency to a more cost-effective and market-based system is strongly encouraged. This chapter outlines the current complex incentive system, highlighting incoherencies and successes, and discusses a proposal for a general reform that includes, in accordance with the European Commission proposal, a carbon taxation.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-21302-6_12,"['Bardazzi, Rossella', 'Pazienza, Maria Grazia']",European Energy and Climate Security,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-21302-6_12,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
281,Pilot Actions in European Cities – Stuttgart,"The field of urban climatology has a long tradition in Stuttgart. It exists as discipline in Stuttgart since 1938. Stuttgart was the first city to establish its own Department of Climatology to research ways of improving the flow of fresh air into the city and to reduce thermal stress in most populated city districts. The specialist department of Urban Climatology, within the Environmental Protection Office, deals with tasks relating to environmental meteorology within the scope of air pollution control and also relating to urban and global climate protection. So in Stuttgart the urban heat island phenomenon (UHI) is studied for several decades, leading to a high level understanding of the UHI and the problems which it causes. The UHI causes an increase in air temperatures and thermal stress, that are identified as most negative impacts on human health and urban living. In the view of global climate change and the predicted temperature rise for the Stuttgart region of 1.5–2 K in this century, the negative impacts of UHI on human health and urban living will become more problematic in the future. According to the results of climate models the frequency of very hot days is expected to jump by nearly 30 % at the end of the century. The rising temperatures due to the global climate change in combination with the temperature shift as a result of the UHI will intensify the heat stress in urban areas, that leads to a significant increasing risk to human health, in particular to the very young and elderly. Not least due its importance for the human health and the quality of urban life in Stuttgart, the UHI is focussed by urban planners and is noticed by the future development of the city. Within the pilot action study in Stuttgart several measure for reducing the UHI and the impacts on urban living and human health are analysed by the use of micro-scale and macro-scale simulations. With the help of these analysis realisable measure are selected. The most useful measures are implemented into a development outline plan for the redevelopment of the city district Stuttgart-West by the municipal urban planners.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-10425-6_10,"['Rinke, Rayk', 'Kapp, Rainer', 'Reuter, Ulrich', 'Ketterer, Christine', 'Fallmann, Joachim', 'Matzarakis, Andreas', 'Emeis, Stefan']",Counteracting Urban Heat Island Effects in a Global Climate Change Scenario,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-10425-6_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
282,Achieving and maintaining institutional feasibility in emissions trading: the case of New Zealand,"Emission trading schemes (ETS) have emerged as a popular climate policy measure and are increasingly advocated as policy instruments to support the transition to a green economy. Using complementary analytical methods, this research investigated the institutional developments and complexities of the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS). It focuses on (1) institutional experience and administrative capacity, and (2) political acceptance during formation, design, implementation, and review. The research answer questions concerning critical conditions that have affected the institutional feasibility of the NZ ETS and the trade-offs in achieving and maintaining institutional feasibility. The experience in New Zealand has demonstrated that bipartisan political support and obliged participant acceptance for an ETS can be achieved and the administrative burden can be kept low through an inclusive consultation process and particular aspects of design to provide more certainty about costs. However, this institutional feasibility has also been a trade-off with other important aspects such as environmental effectiveness, predictability, and legitimacy, posing risks to maintaining political acceptance of the policy design and achieving the longer term objectives of transitioning to a green economy.",2015-12-01,10.1007/s11027-014-9557-4,"['Richter, Jessika Luth', 'Mundaca, Luis']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-014-9557-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

284,Developing country finance in a post-2020 global climate agreement,"A central task for negotiators of the post-2020 global climate agreement is to construct a finance regime that supports low-carbon development in developing economies. As power sector investments between developing countries grow, the climate finance regime should incentivize the decarbonization of these major sources of finance by integrating them as a complement to the commitments of developed nations. The emergence of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, South–South Cooperation Fund and other nascent institutions reveal the fissures that exist in rules and norms surrounding international finance in the power sector. Structuring the climate agreement in Paris to credit qualified finance from the developing world could have several advantages, including: (1) encouraging low-carbon cooperation between developing countries; (2) incentivizing emerging investors to prefer low-carbon investments; and (3) enabling more cost-effective attainment of national and global climate objectives. Failure to coordinate on standards now could hinder low-carbon development in the decades to come.

285,Measuring greenhouse gas emissions for the transportation sector in Korea,"This paper presents a methodology of measuring greenhouse gas emissions (mainly CO_2) for the transportation sector and illustratively applies it in Korea. The transportation sector is one of the most critical sectors concerning environmental pollution and represents about 20 percent of the yearly total greenhouse gas emissions for the energy sector in Korea. In spite of the increasing importance of the transportation sector in the eco-environment, current methodologies to analyze greenhouse gas emissions use a Tier 1 method, which is the simplest type among the methodologies recommended by IPCC guidelines. For a new methodology, we consider characteristics of transportation modes and operational environments in Korea. The proposed methodology can analyze the amount of greenhouse gas emissions for each transport mode and integrate it through transportation environments. It also provides a decision-making tool for governments to make transportation polices. As a result, the Korean government can manage the transportation sector in an eco-friendly manner and improve the national eco-environment.",2015-07-01,10.1007/s10479-013-1452-y,"['Sim, Seungbae', 'Oh, Jisoo', 'Jeong, Bongju']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-013-1452-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
286,Principles and practice for the equitable governance of transboundary natural resources: cross-cutting lessons for marine fisheries management,"Conflicts over the equitability of transboundary natural resource conservation and management schemes have created barriers to effective policy implementation and practice.

Searching for cross-cutting lessons and themes, we first review multilateral environmental agreements to see how equity is commonly being defined, understood, and then applied in principle. From this analysis, we identify common elements that can facilitate the conceptual framing and application of equitable principles in practice. Framed within these elements, we then explore how applications of equitable principles have performed in two current transboundary conservation and management case studies in regional fisheries management and international climate change policy. From this analysis, we conclude with some lessons learned which show that finding solutions to equity-driven barriers to transboundary conservation, while challenging, are well within our existing capacity to develop and execute.",2015-06-30,10.1186/s40152-015-0028-7,"['Campbell, Brooke', 'Hanich, Quentin']",Maritime Studies,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40152-015-0028-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
287,Crossing the river by feeling the stones: the case of carbon trading in China,"Putting a price on carbon is considered a crucial step for China’s endeavor of harnessing the market forces to reduce its energy consumption and carbon emissions. Indeed, aligned with China’s grand experiment with low-carbon provinces and low-carbon cities in six provinces and thirty-six cities, the Chinese central government has approved the seven pilot carbon trading schemes. These pilot trading schemes have features in common, but vary considerably in their approach to issues such as the coverage of sectors, allocation of allowances, price uncertainty and market stabilization, potential market power of dominated players, use of offsets, and enforcement and compliance. This article explains why China turns to market forces and is opt for emissions trading, rather than carbon or environmental taxes at least initially, discusses the five pilot trading schemes that have to comply with their emissions obligations by June 2014, and examines a wide range of design, implementation, enforcement and compliance issues related to China’s carbon trading pilots and their first-year performance. The article ends with drawing some lessons learned and discussing the options to evolve regional pilot carbon trading schemes into a nationwide carbon trading scheme.",2015-04-01,10.1007/s10018-015-0104-7,"['Zhang, ZhongXiang']",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10018-015-0104-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

289,Optimization of method to quantify soil organic matter dynamics and carbon sequestration potential in volcanic ash soils,"Volcanic ash-derived soils are important globally for their C sequestration potential and because they are at risk of compaction and degradation due to land use change. Poorly or non-crystalline minerals impart enormous capacity for soils to store and stabilize C, but also unusual chemical and physical properties that make quantifying meaningful soil C pools challenging. Here, we optimize a soil physical fractionation method to effectively assess soil organic matter dynamics in volcanic ash soils by first comparing three common methods for Andisols of the same soil series under three land uses. Components of those methods that (1) effectively isolated C pools of different size and turnover and (2) demonstrated potential sensitivity to land use change were then modified for a final, combined method. The isolation of C pools corresponding to fundamental mechanisms of protection within aggregates and organo-mineral control on the stabilization of C, which often function to the extreme in volcanic ash soils, underlie these modifications. Combined application of ultrasonic energy to disrupt aggregates and the removal of light fractions with sequential high density fractionation successfully isolated multiple C pools that ranged in radiocarbon-based turnover time from 7 to 1,011 year in the surface 0–15 cm of mineral soil in an undisturbed, native forest. Soil C accumulates as a result of high, continuous input that cycles through a transitional (century-scale) organo-mineral pool and then either becomes occluded and protected within aggregates (multiple centuries) or enters a continuum of organo-mineral and non-crystalline mineral-dominated pools (from centuries to millennium-scale). Comparison of relative C pool sizes and C isotope signature among soils from native forest, grazed pasture, and managed Eucalyptus plantation revealed the potential for making accurate, direct measurements of soil C change over time with land use and management change or disturbance regime.",2015-03-01,10.1007/s10533-014-0051-6,"['Crow, Susan E.', 'Reeves, Mataia', 'Schubert, Olivia S.', 'Sierra, Carlos A.']",Biogeochemistry,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10533-014-0051-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
290,"Carbon Accounting: A Review of the Existing Models, Principles and Practical Applications","The Kyoto Protocol has opened up an international debate about the appearance of different regulations which focus on carbon accounting and reporting. Specifically, the Kyoto Protocol established that the Conference of the Parties shall define the relevant principles, models, rules and guidelines, in particular for verification, reporting and accountability for carbon allowances. As a consequence, many companies remain confused as to the appropriate carbon accounting model. Due to the existing controversies on the topic, the aim of the present work is twofold. Firstly, and from a macroeconomic point of view, this work attempts to analyse the different carbon accounting regulations existing at the international level. Secondly, and from a firm level, describe the main practical carbon accounting principles and applications in different industries. Main results reveal the existence of different approaches at the corporate level in the international context about carbon accounting and reporting. This has several implications from a company point of view, being one of the most important the impact of the carbon accounting model choice on companies’ financial performance.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-27718-9_4,"['Ortas, Eduardo', 'Gallego-Álvarez, Isabel', 'Álvarez, Igor', 'Moneva, José M.']",Corporate Carbon and Climate Accounting,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-27718-9_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

The chapter highlights key areas of challenges and implications that need to be addressed to continue program development of forest carbon sink projects with the support of financing mechanisms. This study provides possible implications for other provinces or municipalities at a local level in China and other developing countries preparing for, or in the process of, facilitating trading platforms for forest carbon sinks at a national level. This chapter also provides a comparison of the development of voluntary forestry carbon sinks in Yunnan and Zhejiang Provinces. It draws comparisons from four viewpoints: regional financial support, development of organisations, talent development, and exchange of experience. Finally, it concludes that capabilities of forestry resources appraisal should be improved, financial support and experience exchange strengthened, and carbon credit trading strongly promoted.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-11319-7_3,"['Zhu, Ying', 'Lan, Hong', 'Ness, David A.', 'Xing, Ke', 'Schneider, Kris', 'Lee, Seung-Hee', 'Ge, Jing']",Transforming Rural Communities in China and Beyond,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-11319-7_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
292,Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea: Enhancing Flexibility in International Climate Change Law,"The evolving nature of the climate change problem makes it challenging to govern it through a single set of rules fixed in time. Scientific insights into the causes and impacts of climate change are subject to constant changes. Further, the socio-economic and political conditions prevailing in different countries continue to alter over time. This chapter first assesses how the primary international legal response, the regime established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, has sought to cope with these temporal challenges, and suggests that while various flexibility mechanisms are in place, the climate regime often finds it hard to adapt to changing conditions. In a second step, the chapter examines an alternative in the form of proposals that aim to make international climate change law more adaptive through a pluralist approach. The chapter critically reviews these proposals, and suggests that while the rigidities of the existing climate regime certainly need to be addressed, considerations of predictability and stability should not be sacrificed at the altar of flexibility. To conclude, therefore, the chapter explores the options for enhancing flexibility within the current architecture for international climate change law.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-94-6265-060-2_10,"['Asselt, Harro']",Netherlands Yearbook of International Law 2014,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-6265-060-2_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
293,Designing Environmental Instruments to Finance Agricultural Intensification Through the Clean Development Mechanism: Direct Cost Subsidy Versus Tax Cut Under Asymmetric Information,"Various agreements addressing climate change plead for the adoption of innovative green technologies to reduce production of greenhouse gases responsible for global warming. Yet, the most successful instrument so far, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is at pains to succeed in small, developing countries facing sustainable development problems like food security. Worse, while the CDM succeeded in financing agricultural projects, few are funded in small, developing countries. A tax cut is one innovative financial scheme that many countries enact in their investment code to promote environmentally sound technologies. Tax cuts return a portion of investment costs to firms that implement green innovations, which ultimately reduces investment costs and so adds to their net benefits. We compare this scheme to a direct cost subsidy designed to offer firms access to capital at a lower interest, for their capacities to boost the use of CDM in agriculture. This paper shows that the narrow scope of tax cuts compared to direct cost subsidies make corporate tax relief inadequate for the needs of developing countries. We also show that while both schemes are equally efficient under perfect conditions and asymmetric information, the direct cost subsidy is more appropriate to further environmental and sustainability goals like food security in developing countries where informational problems are pervasive.

295,"The Evolution of European Energy and Climate Policies: The View of a Market Player
","In the late 1990s the EU re-designed its energy system (electricity and gas) to take advantage of the internal market by enhancing competition, transparency and efficiency. As climate change broke into the international agenda, the objective of decarbonization of the energy supply was added to this design resulting in a long-term comprehensive articulation of climate and energy policies, addressing competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply. The 2014 deadline for the completion of the internal energy market is approaching and the debate on the climate and energy policy framework to 2030 is getting into its crucial phase. It is therefore timely to assess what has been achieved so far, also to learn from the past. The European market is still fragmented, the EU ETS is in trouble and industry and consumers complain about high energy prices. Are the objectives of decarbonization and fully integrated European energy markets compatible? Has a good design been undermined by failures of implementing instruments? This paper examines the evolution of energy and climate policies in the Union in the last decades with the eyes of one of the largest electricity players in the Continent. We believe decarbonization and a functional pan-European electricity market are both achievable with a serious rethinking of the current market model toward an ‘Energy Plus Capacity’ market with a strengthened ETS. This approach can also help in reducing the wedge between the costs of producing electricity (wholesale prices) and end-users prices resulting in electricity bills reflecting more closely the costs of generation and supply.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-14099-5_12,"['Mori, Simone', 'Montesano, Giuseppe']",Achieving Dynamism in an Anaemic Europe,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-14099-5_12,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
296,The Sustainable Apparel Coalition and the Higg Index,"The Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) seeks to lead the apparel industry toward a shared vision of sustainability built upon a common approach for evaluating sustainability performance. By developing a common tool—the Sustainable Apparel Index—the SAC enables apparel industry companies to measure the environmental and social impact of apparel production throughout the product lifecycle, from design to end of use or recycling of the product. The potential impact of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition is enormous. SAC member companies (including brands, retailers and manufacturers) are estimated to be responsible for more than one third of the apparel and footwear produced globally. The SAC has built a strong foundation and made significant progress since its launch in 2010. As the coalition looks forward, there are a few key challenges that members must be prepared to overcome in order to reach shared sustainability goals. The Higg Index, announced by the SAC, is primarily an indicator-based assessment tool for apparel and footwear products that was launched in 2012. The Higg Index has a suite of self-assessment tools dealing with facility, brand, and product and asks practice-based, qualitative questions to gauge environmental sustainability performance and drive behavior for improvement. It is a learning tool for both small and large companies to identify challenges and capture ongoing improvement. It targets a spectrum of performance that allows beginners and leaders in environmental sustainability, regardless of company size, to identify opportunities. The SAC has established a strong foundation of organizational culture and progress, faces both opportunities and challenges, opens membership to any interested company in the apparel sector and drives the Index tool through further iterations and industry adoption. As the organization grows and evolves, it must retain its unique culture and speed at the same time that it balances membership growth, which may bring evolving expectations around sustainability aspirations and engagement to the coalition. The SAC must look forward in order to achieve its long-term vision of transforming apparel industry such that it produces no unnecessary environmental harm and has a positive impact on the people and communities associated with its activities. The organization is poised to build on its success with strong momentum and member commitment. Translating the coalition’s accomplishments and lessons learned across the apparel industry (and to other industries) will be the true measure of SAC’s success.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-981-287-164-0_2,"['Radhakrishnan, Shanthi']",Roadmap to Sustainable Textiles and Clothing,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-287-164-0_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
297,Evaluation of Salinity Offset Programs in Australia,"This chapter provides an ex-post policy evaluation of three offsetting programs designed to mitigate irrigation induced salinity in Australia. Environmental effects from salinity are substantial in Australia, with the estimated cost of environmental degradation due to salinity of some A$300 million per year. Offsetting, as an economic policy instrument, is cost-effective in comparison to the conventional regulatory approaches (e.g. engineering approaches or mandate based policies) as it allows environmental improvement to be achieved at reduced cost. Salinity offsets are designed to compensate for salinity impacts from a given agricultural activity by providing a commensurate reduction of salinity impact elsewhere. Policy evaluation of salinity offsetting programs was approached by collecting, collating and processing data pertinent to three Australian case studies. A key finding is that salinity offsets in Australia have been reasonably successful since their implementation. While it was not possible to precisely discern the environmental effectiveness of the offsetting programs, there is clear evidence that the salinity problem has subsided in Australia in the time since the introduction of the offsets, and that they can be at least partly credited for this outcome. At the same time, robust findings about the economic effectiveness of salinity offsetting programs emerged from the study.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-18287-2_17,"['Ancev, Tiho', 'Azad, M. A.

298,The Economic and CO_2 Emissions Performance in Aviation: An Empirical Analysis of Major European Airlines,"The sustainability of aviation in global supply chains is of increasing importance to airline management and policy makers. With mounting environmental pressures and market volatilities, airlines need to find strategies for simultaneously managing their economic and environmental (emissions) performance, two objectives that can support but also contradict each other. This chapter aims to evaluate the relative performance of airlines’ carbon and cost efficiency and how this relationship has changed over time. We compute and compare the carbon efficiency of 14 major European airlines for the period of 1986–2007. As jet fuel is the most important resource in the aviation supply chain, we examine whether there is a relationship between fuel prices and carbon efficiency. We also test whether unit cost, distance flown and load factors have an impact on airline carbon efficiency. The results show that the fuel prices and their volatility have affected and improved carbon efficiency of airlines. Our findings also confirm previous anecdotal evidence suggesting a significant negative relationship between carbon efficiency and unit cost.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-17181-4_11,"['Miyoshi, Chikage', 'Merkert, Rico']",Green Logistics and Transportation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-17181-4_11,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
299,"The bears are right: Why cap-and-trade yields greater emission reductions than expected, and what that means for climate policy","Cap-and-trade, a regulatory instrument widely used to constrain greenhouse gas and other pollution, has recently been criticized for producing only small amounts of intended emission reductions. This paper looks at the empirical record of cap-and-trade since the beginning in 1995, and shows that emission targets have almost always been easier and cheaper to reach than expected. The five main reasons are generous targets, changes in economic output, fuel price movements, innovation, and complementary emission reduction policies. Overall, this failure to predict mitigation potentials may relate to a psychological “end of history bias,” whereby policymakers, industry, and analysts think that less change will happen in the future than has demonstrably happened in the past. Consequently, more abatement is possible and at lower costs than generally thought, rendering the prices of emission permits hard to predict. For climate research, the findings imply that emission scenarios assuming ever-increasing pollution prices may benefit from integrating recent experience with cap-and-trade regulations. In policy terms, mechanisms such as floor prices need to be considered to guarantee emission reductions under uncertainty.",2014-12-01,10.1007/s10584-014-1282-1,"['Tvinnereim, Endre']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-014-1282-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
300,Transaction costs for carbon sequestration projects in the tropical forest sector,"There is general consensus that carbon (C) sequestration projects in forests are a relatively low cost option for mitigating climate change, but most studies on the subject have assumed that transaction costs are negligible. The objectives of the study were to examine transaction costs for forest C sequestration projects and to determine the significance of the costs based on economic analyses. Here we examine four case studies of active C sequestration projects being implemented in tropical countries and developed for the C market. The results from the case studies were then used with a dynamic forest and land use economic model to investigate how transaction costs affect the efficiency and cost of forest C projects globally. In the case studies transaction costs ranged from 0.38 to 27 million US dollars ($0.09 to $7.71/t CO_2) or 0.3 to 270 % of anticipated income depending principally on the price of C and project size. The three largest cost categories were insurance (under the voluntary market; 41–89 % of total costs), monitoring (3–42 %) and regulatory approval (8–50 %). The global analysis indicated that most existing estimates of marginal costs of C sequestration are underestimated by up to 30 % because transaction costs were not included.",2014-12-01,10.1007/s11027-013-9469-8,"['Pearson, Timothy R.

301,Importance of food-demand management for climate mitigation,"Recent studies show that current trends in yield improvement will not be sufficient to meet projected global food demand in 2050, and suggest that a further expansion of agricultural area will be required. However, agriculture is the main driver of losses of biodiversity and a major contributor to climate change and pollution, and so further expansion is undesirable. The usual proposed alternative—intensification with increased resource use—also has negative effects. It is therefore imperative to find ways to achieve global food security without expanding crop or pastureland and without increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Some authors have emphasized a role for sustainable intensification in closing global ‘yield gaps’ between the currently realized and potentially achievable yields. However, in this paper we use a transparent, data-driven model, to show that even if yield gaps are closed, the projected demand will drive further agricultural expansion. There are, however, options for reduction on the demand side that are rarely considered. In the second part of this paper we quantify the potential for demand-side mitigation options, and show that improved diets and decreases in food waste are essential to deliver emissions reductions, and to provide global food security in 2050. With food demand set to double, agriculture will account for a larger proportion of total future greenhouse-gas emissions. Yet global food production and land-use scenarios have received relatively little attention in relation to climate change mitigation. This study shows that to avoid dangerous climate change, we must address food demand, as sustainable intensification of agriculture does not, in itself, suffice.",2014-10-01,10.1038/nclimate2353,"['Bajželj, Bojana', 'Richards, Keith S.', 'Allwood, Julian M.', 'Smith, Pete', 'Dennis, John S.', 'Curmi, Elizabeth', 'Gilligan, Christopher A.']",Nature Climate Change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2353.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
302,Global and regional trends in greenhouse gas emissions from livestock,"Following IPCC guidelines ( IPCC 2006 ), we estimate greenhouse gas emissions related to livestock in 237 countries and 11 livestock categories during the period 1961–2010. We find that in 2010 emissions of methane and nitrous oxide related to livestock worldwide represented approximately 9 % of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Global GHG emissions from livestock increased by 51 % during the analyzed period, mostly due to strong growth of emissions in developing (Non-Annex I) countries (+117 %). In contrast, developed country (Annex I) emissions decreased (−23 %). Beef and dairy cattle are the largest source of livestock emissions (74 % of global livestock emissions). Since developed countries tend to have lower CO_2-equivalent GHG emissions per unit GDP and per quantity of product generated in the livestock sector, the amount of wealth generated per unit GHG emitted from the livestock sector can be increased by improving both livestock farming practices in developing countries and the overall state of economic development. Our results reveal important details of how livestock production and associated GHG emissions have occurred in time and space. Discrepancies with higher tiers, demonstrate the value of more detailed analyses, and discourage over interpretation of smaller-scale trends in the Tier 1 results, but do not undermine the value of global Tier 1 analysis.",2014-09-01,10.1007/s10584-014-1197-x,"['Caro, Dario', 'Davis, Steven J.', 'Bastianoni, Simone', 'Caldeira, Ken']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-014-1197-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
303,On evaluating success in complex policy mixes: the case of renewable energy support schemes,"The aim of this paper is to propose the main elements of a theoretical and methodological framework for the assessment of the success of complex policy mixes, to highlight the conflicts between individual instruments and other elements within those mixes and to propose policy recommendations in order to mitigate them. Some criteria are defined, and different levels of analysis are considered. The challenges in evaluating policy packages are illustrated with the case of the coexistence between renewable energy support and emissions trading schemes. It is shown that policy mixes inherently lead to interactions between the different instruments, either in the form of conflicts or synergies. Conflicts are horizontal (i.e., between different types of instruments) and/or vertical (i.e., between different administrative levels). It is suggested that mitigating those conflicts could require administrative coordination. Relevant coordination could take place between different administrative levels and relate to different instruments or different design elements within similar instruments. However, given the trade-offs between different criteria, the role of coordination is necessarily limited.",2014-09-01,10.1007/s11077-013-9189-7,"['Río, Pablo']",Policy Sciences,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11077-013-9189-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

305,Climate-smart agriculture global research agenda: scientific basis for action,"Background Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) addresses the challenge of meeting the growing demand for food, fibre and fuel, despite the changing climate and fewer opportunities for agricultural expansion on additional lands. CSA focuses on contributing to economic development, poverty reduction and food security; maintaining and enhancing the productivity and resilience of natural and agricultural ecosystem functions, thus building natural capital; and reducing trade-offs involved in meeting these goals. Current gaps in knowledge, work within CSA, and agendas for interdisciplinary research and science-based actions identified at the 2013 Global Science Conference on Climate-Smart Agriculture (Davis, CA, USA) are described here within three themes: (1) farm and food systems, (2) landscape and regional issues and (3) institutional and policy aspects. The first two themes comprise crop physiology and genetics, mitigation and adaptation for livestock and agriculture, barriers to adoption of CSA practices, climate risk management and energy and biofuels (theme 1); and modelling adaptation and uncertainty, achieving multifunctionality, food and fishery systems, forest biodiversity and ecosystem services, rural migration from climate change and metrics (theme 2). Theme 3 comprises designing research that bridges disciplines, integrating stakeholder input to directly link science, action and governance. Outcomes In addition to interdisciplinary research among these themes, imperatives include developing (1) models that include adaptation and transformation at either the farm or landscape level; (2) capacity approaches to examine multifunctional solutions for agronomic, ecological and socioeconomic challenges; (3) scenarios that are validated by direct evidence and metrics to support behaviours that foster resilience and natural capital; (4) reductions in the risk that can present formidable barriers for farmers during adoption of new technology and practices; and (5) an understanding of how climate affects the rural labour force, land tenure and cultural integrity, and thus the stability of food production. Effective work in CSA will involve stakeholders, address governance issues, examine uncertainties, incorporate social benefits with technological change, and establish climate finance within a green development framework. Here, the socioecological approach is intended to reduce development controversies associated with CSA and to identify technologies, policies and approaches leading to sustainable food production and consumption patterns in a changing climate.",2014-08-26,10.1186/2048-7010-3-11,"['Steenwerth, Kerri L', 'Hodson, Amanda K', 'Bloom, Arnold J', 'Carter, Michael R', 'Cattaneo, Andrea', 'Chartres, Colin J', 'Hatfield, Jerry L', 'Henry, Kevin', 'Hopmans, Jan W', 'Horwath, William R', 'Jenkins, Bryan M', 'Kebreab, Ermias', 'Leemans, Rik', 'Lipper, Leslie', 'Lubell, Mark N', 'Msangi, Siwa', 'Prabhu, Ravi', 'Reynolds, Matthew P', 'Sandoval Solis, Samuel', 'Sischo, William M', 'Springborn, Michael', 'Tittonell, Pablo', 'Wheeler, Stephen M', 'Vermeulen, Sonja J', 'Wollenberg, Eva K', 'Jarvis, Lovell S', 'Jackson, Louise E']",Agriculture & Food Security,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/2048-7010-3-11,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
306,On Emissions Trading and Market Structure: Cap-and-Trade versus Intensity Standards,"This paper examines the interdependence between imperfect competition and emissions trading. We particularly analyze the long run equilibrium in a two-sector (‘clean’ and ‘dirty’) model with Cournot competition among firms who face a fixed cost of production. The clean sector is defined as the sector with the highest long run cost margin on emissions. We compare the welfare implications of a cap-and-trade scheme with an emissions trading scheme based on relative intensity standards. It is shown that a firm’s long run equilibrium output in the clean or dirty sector does not depend on the emissions trading format, but only depends on the fixed cost of producing in the respective sector. Intensity standards can result in clean firms selling allowances to dirty firms, or dirty firms selling to clean firms. The former outcome yields higher welfare. It is demonstrated that cap-and-trade outperforms the intensity-based trading scheme in terms of long run welfare with free entry and exit. With intensity standards the size of the clean sector is too large.",2014-08-01,10.1007/s10640-013-9715-2,"['Vries, Frans P.', 'Dijkstra, Bouwe R.', 'McGinty, Matthew']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-013-9715-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

Furthermore, many different trade-offs must be considered, for example between operational costs and customer service. But as soon as environmental issues are concerned, other critical issues must be considered as well. Based on a case study from the petrochemical industry, this paper extends two basic facility location models and shows the impact of distribution network-design decisions on the economic and environmental performance of the company. The results show a trade-off between total (distribution) costs and transport carbon emissions.",2014-07-01,10.1007/s11573-014-0730-8,"['Treitl, Stefan', 'Jammernegg, Werner']",Journal of Business Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11573-014-0730-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
308,The importance of reduced meat and dairy consumption for meeting stringent climate change targets,"For agriculture, there are three major options for mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: 1) productivity improvements, particularly in the livestock sector; 2) dedicated technical mitigation measures; and 3) human dietary changes. The aim of the paper is to estimate long-term agricultural GHG emissions, under different mitigation scenarios, and to relate them to the emissions space compatible with the 2 °C temperature target. Our estimates include emissions up to 2070 from agricultural soils, manure management, enteric fermentation and paddy rice fields, and are based on IPCC Tier 2 methodology. We find that baseline agricultural CO_2-equivalent emissions (using Global Warming Potentials with a 100 year time horizon) will be approximately 13 Gton CO_2eq/year in 2070, compared to 7.1 Gton CO_2eq/year 2000. However, if faster growth in livestock productivity is combined with dedicated technical mitigation measures, emissions may be kept to 7.7 Gton CO_2eq/year in 2070. If structural changes in human diets are included, emissions may be reduced further, to 3–5 Gton CO_2eq/year in 2070. The total annual emissions for meeting the 2 °C target with a chance above 50 % is in the order of 13 Gton CO_2eq/year or less in 2070, for all sectors combined. We conclude that reduced ruminant meat and dairy consumption will be indispensable for reaching the 2 °C target with a high probability, unless unprecedented advances in technology take place.",2014-05-01,10.1007/s10584-014-1104-5,"['Hedenus, Fredrik', 'Wirsenius, Stefan', 'Johansson, Daniel J.

309,Carbon tax based on the emission factor: a bilevel programming approach,"We present a bilevel programming approach to design an effective carbon tax scheme based on the production emission factor, used as an intensity measure, for a competitive market with multiple players. At the upper level, the government sets a target emission factor for the industry and taxes firms if they exceed that target. At the lower level, the industry sets output levels that maximize social welfare. The bilevel model is transformed to a linear MIP by replacing the lower level optimization problem by its KKT conditions, and linearizing the complementarity slackness conditions. We test the model in the context of the cement industry. The results show that the proposed model finds the optimal tax rate that induces firms to switch to less carbon-intensive fuels and reduces the overall emissions.",2014-04-01,10.1007/s10898-013-0068-8,"['Almutairi, Hossa', 'Elhedhli, Samir']",Journal of Global Optimization,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10898-013-0068-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
310,The environment as a strategic priority in the European Union–Brazil partnership: is the EU behaving as a normative power or soft imperialist?,"In 2007, Brazil entered the European Union’s (EU) list of strategic partners; a token of recognition of the place Brazil occupies in current global affairs. Although promoting bilateral environmental convergence is a stated priority, cooperation between the EU and Brazil in this policy field is largely under-researched, raising interesting questions as to whether the current state of play could support EU claims for the normative orientation of its external environmental policy. Through an analysis of partnership activities in the fields of deforestation and biofuels, we suggest that while normative intentions may be regarded as a motivating force, critically viewing EU foreign environmental policy through a ‘soft imperialism’ lens could offer a more holistic understanding of the current state of bilateral cooperation. While the normative power thesis can be substantiated with regard to deforestation, we argue that by erecting barriers to shield its domestic biofuels production, the EU is placing trade competitiveness and economic growth above its normative aspirations. Subsequently, the partial adoption of sustainable development as an EU norm leads to policy incoherence and contradictory actions.",2014-03-01,10.1007/s10784-013-9232-3,"['Afionis, Stavros', 'Stringer, Lindsay C.']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-013-9232-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
311,Carbon Markets: Linking the International Emission Trading Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS),"The trading of carbon emission permits is an instrument created recently to tackle the climate change problem. From 2005 onward, in particular, the volume and significance of different carbon emission trading schemes have increased spectacularly; despite the fact that new emission trading schemes are appearing, the value of the market had fallen by the end of the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period in 2012. One fundamental reason for this was the uncertainty as to whether a new global agreement or protocol would be reached in 2015. The main goal of this chapter is to offer an overview of International Emission Trading under the Kyoto Protocol together with the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), as the schemes at the core of today’s carbon markets, exploring their basic structure, their main links, and their differences, including a carbon price analysis underlining their fundamental weaknesses and strengths.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_57-1,"['Martínez de Alegría, Itziar', 'Molina, Gonzalo', 'del Río, Belén']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_57-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
312,Emissions Trading,"Climate change is being exacerbated by the emissions of globe-warming greenhouse gases (GHGs) as a consequence of economic activities associated with energy, industry, transportation, and land use. From an economic viewpoint, the Earth’s climate is a public good , and pollution a negative externality ; such change therefore constitutes market failure . Controlling air pollution by utilizing economic mechanisms represents an important change in environmental thinking – literally a paradigm shift away from historical command-and-control engineering systems. Today, this approach is being utilized to mitigate the emissions of GHGs, addressing the pollution externality by putting a price on carbon. The international carbon market, largely developed as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, had a total value of $176 billion in 2011, but it has decreased significantly in recent years. With the addition of China and other national and subnational programs, however, it is expected that it will once again increase, as a larger and larger portion of emitted GHGs come under such regulatory purview. Historically, the largest component of that market has been the European Union’s Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which represents a regional market designed first to assist Europe in achieving compliance with the Protocol’s requirements, and now is a cornerstone of the EU’s policy to combat climate change. It also has links to the Protocol’s project-based mechanisms, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI), which help minimize compliance costs. China’s nascent market – currently seven pilot schemes, but expected to become a national program in 2016 – should ultimately become twice as large as the EU ETS. Other carbon markets created in numerous countries (e.g., the U.S., Japan, South Korea, etc.) as well as a voluntary market are also expected to make significant contributions. This chapter discusses the structure of these emissions trading carbon markets, the theory behind their development, their historical evolution, ongoing governance challenges, and future prospects.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_8-2,"['Raufer, Roger', 'Coussy, Paula', 'Freeman, Carla', 'Iyer, Sudha']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_8-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
313,Emission Allowances: Non-legal Terminology and Problems of Qualification,"The essay analyses the issue of the legal qualification of greenhouse gases emission “allowances” as a clear example of the problems arising in the translation and interpretation of legal texts within the EU context. In particular, the essay highlights that sometimes the EU legislator introduces new concepts specific to EU law, while it applies ambiguous terms and avoids providing definitions, often as a result of the difficulties in reaching a political agreement on terms that convey concepts linked to the different legal cultures of the different Member States. In front of these difficulties in reaching an agreement on common definitions and shared concepts, the EU lawmakers tend to prefer a non-legal terminology. As these apparently neutral terms contain no useful legal content, lawyers end up facing very difficult issues of interpretation. The absence of common terms and general legal concepts at an EU level, at least in specific areas, can lead to significantly different outcomes in the legal practices of Member States and consequently has a relevant impact on the process of harmonisation. These issues are clearly exemplified by the problem of the legal qualification of greenhouse gases emission allowances. In fact, failing a legal definition of emission allowances in EU legislation, the legal nature of allowances and their regulation are necessarily contingent on the relevant legal system, with the consequent and inevitable differences between Member States.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-37152-3_11,"['Jacometti, Valentina']","Criminal Proceedings, Languages and the European Union",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-37152-3_11,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
314,Inter-disciplinary Analysis of Climate Change and Society: A Network Approach,"Social network analysis (SNA) can be used to consider the interactive effects of the social and natural sciences as well as the humanities in such a conjoint way as to enable to the study of societal patterns and dynamics as unified systems of action and change. In contrast to previous attempts at this type of integration, which have remained largely abstract and theoretical and exemplified by anecdotal information, the application of SNA to this effort enables a more empirical and precise analysis of the respective effects of different factors to process and outcome. This unified SNA method can be used to examine any type of societal action, including in this case the production of and response to global climate change. Called Integrative Structurational Analysis (ISA), this method expands upon the traditional application of SNA, which confined itself to the study of relationships among human social actors (persons, groups, organizations, nations, etc.). In addition, the ISA approach incorporates advances in discourse network analysis (DNA) that includes ideas (abstract collective representations of social and natural realities charged with emotion and meaning) as well as actors in the networks. Studied as they emerge, or are channeled, and evolve over time, these patterns are measured as to how they influence outcomes of concern, such as in this case the mitigation of emissions. The on-going international research project Comparing Climate Change Policy Networks (Compon) illustrates the application of this ISA method and approach to the mitigation policy-formation processes of a set of nation-states and one region.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-94-017-8959-2_10,"['Broadbent, Jeffrey', 'Vaughter, Philip']",Understanding Society and Natural Resources,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-017-8959-2_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
315,Valuing Options in Water Markets: A Laboratory Investigation,"Risk and reliability dominate water supply discussions in the arid western United States due to increasing demand and finite, weather-dependent supply. Water markets have evolved in this region so agencies could meet this growing demand. In a few instances, water agencies turned to contractual mechanisms such as options to manage supply. As demand continues to grow option markets and other novel approaches to allocating water may become increasingly popular. We utilize experimental economics to analyze the effect of annual options on water markets in the absence of sufficient real-world data for conventional econometric analysis. We find gains from trade are higher when options can be traded. Additionally, gains are more evenly distributed, particularly with a dominant buyer and many sellers.

The resulting valuation has to be introduced into the market, and the usual proposal is that it is done by means of applying equivalent taxes. But the OECD admits that situations (and therefore valuations) vary widely. They depend on differing environmental circumstances, on incomes, etc. If the factors that determine the valuation are very different from one country to another, taxes will also vary and, in a context of trade liberalisation such as the one we have today, companies in countries with high taxes will see a fall in their competitiveness. This situation is frequently acknowledged in the texts of the OECD and the EU, but they cannot accept its consequences, so they are always looking for a false way out: the coordination of environmental policies.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-94-017-8981-3_4,"['Bermejo, Roberto']",Handbook for a Sustainable Economy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-017-8981-3_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

320,Basis for an Eco-effective and Integrated Product Strategy,"At the turn of the century the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Austria were developing an integrated approach regarding products, and were pressing the European Union to adopt it. Although the European Council formally adopted this approach in its Sustainable Development Strategy (2001) (the Integrated Product Policy (IPP) “is an integral part of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy”) (COM(2003)302 final), and the Commission approved a Green Paper on the subject that same year, the EU was not able to produce a White Paper, previously agreed to be issued in 2002. Instead of it, the Commission approved in 2003 the Communication Integrated Product Policy (COM(2003) 302 final). The Green Paper on Integrated Product Policy defines it as “an approach which seeks to reduce the life cycle environmental impacts of products from the mining of raw materials to production, distribution, use, and waste management”. What we define as an integrated product strategy (IPS) comprises elements of the IPP, in a deeper and more integrated way, and other new elements which are needed in a strategy for sustainability. In the first place, the basic approach has to change: the concept of eco-efficiency is replaced with that of eco-effectiveness. Besides, selective policies are needed, especially for products and services which are responsible for most environmental impacts, and for the producer groups most inclined to change. Not only an improvement in products and services is required, but that also the consumption model should be changed.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-94-017-8981-3_18,"['Bermejo, Roberto']",Handbook for a Sustainable Economy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-017-8981-3_18,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
321,Towards Sustainable Transport at the End of the Fossil Fuel Era,"In the past mobility grew strongly, as well as transport speed and the average length of journeys. However, mobility has been slowed down during recent years due to rising oil prices and the economic crisis, which primarily affect most OECD countries. The transport sector suffered the biggest impact due to its high dependency on oil: In the world 95 % of the energy consumed by transport is oil (in the EU consumption reaches 96 %). In particular, in 2007 and during the first half of 2008, high oil prices caused changes to the traditional mobility model in the countries most vulnerable to the phenomenon. Mobility, speed and journey length were reduced. Although most of these changes vanished later, oil scarcity is causing a slow but persistent rise in oil prices, which will cause structural changes. This dependency on oil is caused mainly by the dominant role of road transport in the sector, and to a lesser extent by air transport, which has been the mode with the highest rate of growth.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-94-017-8981-3_12,"['Bermejo, Roberto']",Handbook for a Sustainable Economy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-017-8981-3_12,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
322,An experiment on emissions trading: the effect of different allocation mechanisms,"In theory, efficiency and compliance levels induced by an emission trading system should not depend on the initial allocation mechanism for permits in the absence of transaction costs. In a laboratory experiment we investigate this prediction by comparing frequent and infrequent auctioning as well as two different grandfathering schemes under market rules that closely resemble those of the European Union Emission Trading System. Our experimental results suggest that, contrary to theoretical predictions, the initial allocation procedure has the potential to affect efficiency of the final permit allocation. While we do not identify an effect of the initial allocation procedure itself (auction vs. grandfathering), we observe higher final efficiency after infrequent auctioning of permits than for frequent auctioning. Surprisingly, for a grandfathering scheme that distributes permits proportional to expected needs the high initial efficiency is substantially reduced by secondary market trading. An analysis of behavioral patterns shows that permit prices and abatement levels are initially substantially higher if permits are allocated by auction and we also find more over-banking as compared to the grandfathering treatments.

323,Renewable Portfolio Standards in the Presence of Green Consumers and Emissions Trading,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trading, green pricing programs and renewable portfolio standards (RPS) are three concurrent policies implemented in the United States to reduce reliance on fossil fuel and GHG emissions. Despite their differences in policy targets, they are closely related and integrated with competitive electric markets. This paper examines the interactions among these three policies by considering two aspects of the RPS policy design: double-counting and bundling. Whereas the former grants utilities using the same MWh of renewable energy to meet RPS and to sell as green power, the latter allows them to bundle the renewable energy credits/certificates (RECs) with non-renewable electricity and sell as green power. This paper studies the policy designs by formulating each policy combination as a market model, which treats electricity as a differentiated product. We derive the conditions under which the REC price serves as the upper bound of the green premium or vice versa. The theoretical analysis shows that the bundling could be redundant in the presence of double counting. The policies that allow for double-counting appear to be a better choice, since they result in a higher social surplus. Most surplus gains are due to consumers surplus from green power sales. The framework we develop in this paper is capable of incorporating other detailed policy designs in the analysis such as strategic reserve and offset.",2013-06-01,10.1007/s11067-012-9176-0,"['Chen, Yihsu', 'Wang, Lizhi']",Networks and Spatial Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11067-012-9176-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
324,"Capital Malleability, Emission Leakage and the Cost of Partial Climate Policies: General Equilibrium Analysis of the European Union Emission Trading System","Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models are the premier analytical platform for assessing the economic impacts of climate change mitigation. But these models tend to treat physical capital as “malleable”, capable of reallocation among sectors over the time-period for which equilibrium is solved. Because the extent to which capital adjustment costs might dampen reallocation is not well understood, there is concern that CGE assessments understate the true costs of greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction policies. This paper uses a multi-region, multi-sector CGE model to investigate cap-and-trade schemes, such as the European Union Emission Trading System which cover a subset of the economy, elucidating the effects of capital malleability on GHG abatement, the potential for emission leakage from abating to non-abating sectors, and the impacts on welfare. To simplify the complex interactions being simulated within the CGE model, that analysis is complemented with an analytical model. A partial climate policy results in negative internal carbon leakage, with emissions declining not only in capped sectors but also in non-regulated ones. This result is stronger when capital is intersectorally mobile. Interestingly, in partial climate policy settings capital malleability can amplify or attenuate welfare losses depending on the attributes of the economy.",2013-06-01,10.1007/s10640-012-9625-8,"['Lanzi, Elisa', 'Sue Wing, Ian']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-012-9625-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

328,Climate Law in Germany,"Despite its impressive quantity current climate protection law is not suited to solve the climate problem – neither on a global level through public international law nor in the EU or Germany. In Germany, not only the absolute emission levels raise concerns. Relative development, too, is much worse than is often assumed. German climate law is characterized by a variety of rules, although a substantial part (more or less) implements EU law. The – internationally often copied – German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) contains a fixed tariff for renewable electricity similar to a subsidy. In addition to that and to a number of energy efficiency rules, there are a number of legal rules that directly flank the regulatory, financial, and informational regulations on efficiency, sufficiency, and renewable energies. It remains true, however, that renewable energies and energy efficiency do not per se reduce greenhouse gas emissions or replace fossil fuels; in fact there may also be shifts in emissions and fuel transfers to other countries and/or increases in overall energy consumption. These rebound and shifting effects are a common major barrier to effective climate policy, including energy efficiency policy. A ­completely new cap and trade approach on the EU level (combined with border adjustments) might be the best way to solve these problems.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5440-9_21,"['Ekardt, Felix']",Climate Change and the Law,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5440-9_21,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
329,Environmental Aspects of Kenaf Production and Use,"This chapter outlines the environmental aspects of kenaf production and utilization, focusing on the impact on biotic and abiotic resources, through the analysis of the crop’s interaction with its environment and management practices. In this study, the assessment of data retrieved from literature was supplemented with results obtained from the Biokenaf project. As a bioenergy and biomaterials carrier, kenaf offers ecological advantages over fossil sources by contributing to reduction of greenhouse gases and energy savings. Nevertheless, a negative impact may be perceived in terms of acidifying emissions. Although the different indicators did not yield a common pattern, overall results suggest that kenaf crop have an advantage over other annual energy crop systems, namely regarding pesticides and fertilizers inputs. However, risks associated with soil quality, erodibility, use of resources, and biodiversity are equivalent to most annual energy crops. Crop management options can influence the outcomes, but site specific factors should be accurately assessed to evaluate the adequacy between crop and location. In addition, environmental hot spots in the systems are detected and options for improvement are presented.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4471-5067-1_5,"['Fernando, A.

330,Application of the HJ Biplot Methodology to Variation Greenhouse Gas Emissions in International Companies,"The quantifying and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions is one of the most important tools for monitoring and auditing proposed to mitigate climate change, and it also directly affects business. It is thus vital at this time that we learn in detail whether firms actually report on greenhouse gas emissions and make the account entries that must be included within it.This research has a twofold objective: first to analyse the report on greenhouse gas emissions of international firms in the 2007, 2008 and 2009 period and to see what kind of variation occurs in CO_2 emissions between 2006-2007, 2007-2008 and 2008-2009. Secondly we shall use the biplot methodology to represent emissions variations in firms grouped into geographic areas. To do so we group only the 89 firms in our study into the geographical areas of the Europe (EU), North America (NA), Asia (AS), and South America (SA). As regards the variation in CO_2 emissions, it is noteworthy that variation in CO_2 emissions for the 2006/2007 period are located closer to companies in North America, variation in CO_2 emissions for 2007/2008 are located closer to European Union companies and very strikingly, the variation in CO_2 emissions for the 2008/2009 period are located closer to companies in Asia and South America. This leads us to conclude that companies located in developing countries are nowadays the most aware of climate change and the need to reduce emissions.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-38279-6_2,"['Martínez-Ferrero, Jennifer', 'Gallego-Álvarez, Isabel']","Modeling and Simulation in Engineering, Economics, and Management",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-38279-6_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
331,A method for allocation according to the economic behaviour in the EU-ETS for by-products used in cement industry,"Purpose The most efficient way to reduce the environmental impact of cement production is to replace Portland cement with alternative cementitious materials. These are most often industrial waste such as blast-furnace slags (GBFS) and coal combustion fly ashes (FA). However, a recent European directive no longer considers these products as waste but as by-products. Therefore, the impact of their production has to be considered. Within this new framework, this study develops an evaluation method of their environmental impacts. Method This paper presents pre-existing methods and underlines their limits. Through our evaluation of these methods, it has become clear that the allocation procedure is necessary; however, results depend highly on the chosen allocation procedure. This study presents a new allocation method, based on the fact that both cement and the alternative materials, GBFS and FA, are produced by energy-intensive industries (cement iron and coal) which are all subjected to the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading System. In this carbon trading system, it is economically beneficial for industries to reduce their environmental impact, like for when, by example, by-products from one industry are used as alternative ‘green’ material by another industry. Our allocation coefficient is calculated so that the economic gains and losses are the same for all of the industries involved in these exchanges and provides the overall environmental benefit of the exchanges. Results and discussion The discussion shows that whilst this method has much in common with other allocation methods, it is more accurate as it allocates the environmental costs fairly over the industries involved and is more robust because of its constant value. One of its limits is that it cannot be used for life cycle inventories; however, we test the possibility of choosing a coefficient from one impact category and applying it to all the others. Conclusion Lastly, the technical term of the equation this paper presents could be employed for consequential life cycle assessment, to calculate the most environmental uses by-products could be put to.",2013-01-01,10.1007/s11367-012-0464-1,"['Habert, Guillaume']",The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11367-012-0464-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
332,A Climate for Feminist Intervention: Feminist Science Studies and Climate Change,"For many years, climate change discourse was dominated by a technical-scientific framing based on modernist notions of objective knowledge, control, and efficiency. In recent years, a robust alternative discourse of climate justice has emerged, challenging mainstream adaptation and mitigation policies as reinforcing capitalist, colonialist, and patriarchal power structures and further marginalizing already vulnerable peoples and communities. But while the climate justice movement has provided a sorely needed corrective to climate change discourse, it has been hampered by addressing only policy issues without critically examining the scientific knowledge on which climate change discourse is based. Drawing on critiques of science and technology from ecofeminism and feminist science studies, we argue that scientific knowledge is always already structured by social power relations before it ever enters into policy discussions. In place of the (illusory) God-trick of absolute knowledge and control of the global climate system, we use Haraway’s ideas of feminist objectivity, partial perspective, relations between species, and cyborg standpoints to situate and pluralize knowledge about climate change. This intervention opens up discursive space for multiple, partial knowledge about the climate system, all of which can be held accountable to their ethical and political implications. This pluralization of knowledge allows feminists to recognize and support many forms and venues of climate change-related activism, moving beyond the impasses of international and national political negotiations. Thus, far from dismissing climate change, a feminist critique of climate science makes possible a range of interventions that can more effectively promote social justice and ecological health.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5518-5_3,"['Israel, Andrei L.', 'Sachs, Carolyn']","Research, Action and Policy: Addressing the Gendered Impacts of Climate Change",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5518-5_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
333,Economics of the Environment,"This chapter discusses the foundation of environmental economics. Human activity and behavior in modern society is all incorporated into the market economy system. Economic activity produces wealth when we gather resources from the natural world, processing the material with human labor and technology to produce a good that has added value, exchange the good for other goods produced, and consume them. It is by the adjustment of supply and demand through price that this economic activity is efficiently controlled. The market is not all powerful, however, and it can be argued that a variety of environmental problems in the world are the result of market failure. A typical problem is the excessive consumption of resources or the deterioration of resources, which can be traced to the fact that environmental resources such as air, water, and soil can easily be used by anyone as free goods or nearly for free. Pollution of air and water are typical examples of these dynamics. One major role of environmental management is to control, by various measures, the use of environmental resources that previously have been treated as free goods. Environment problems and the economy are inextricably connected. The important thing now is to choose a desirable path for both the economy and environment. For this, we need a shift in demand toward products and services that are good for the environment.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-4-431-54126-4_8,"['Imura, Hidefumi']",Environmental Systems Studies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-4-431-54126-4_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
334,Mechanism Design for Allocation of Carbon Emission Reduction Units: A Study of Global Companies with Strategic Divisions and Partners,"The problem addressed in this work is concerned with an important challenge faced by any green aware global company to keep its emissions within a prescribed cap. The specific problem is to allocate carbon reductions to its different divisions and supply chain partners in achieving a required target of reductions in its carbon reduction program. The problem becomes a challenging one since the divisions and supply chain partners, being autonomous, could exhibit strategic behavior. We model strategic behavior of the divisions and partners using a game theoretic approach leading to a mechanism design approach to solve this problem. While designing a mechanism for the emission reduction allocation problem, the key properties that need to be satisfied are dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC), strict budget balance (SBB), and allocative efficiency (AE). Mechanism design theory has shown that it is not possible to achieve the above three properties simultaneously. We propose two solutions to the problem satisfying DSIC and AE: (1) a reverse auction protocol and (2) a forward auction protocol, while striving to keep the budget imbalance as low as possible. We compare the performance of the two protocols using a stylized, representative case study.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5995-4_3,"['Bagchi, Deepak', 'Lakshmi, L.

335,Resource Protection Policy: An Opinion from the NGO Perspective,"The industrial societies of the world have been exploiting the existing natural resources to a much greater extent than would be justifiable. This will not only have disastrous consequences for the global climate because resource exploitation means that climate change is inevitably accelerated by an additional emission of carbon into the atmosphere. Furthermore, there will be dramatic effects on the lifestyle of future generations. As a result of resource protection policy, the importance of sustainable development will take on a new shape. After almost 25 years of sustainability policy acting with kid gloves, as it were, it will also be associated with painful social and economic changes. Resource protection policy will neither prevent high technology, nor will it curtail the freedom of individuals. However, as a result of such policy, the zero carbon society, the recycling society and other political concepts that have remained unsuccessful so far will become standard ones. Successful resource protection policy will reduce the resource consumption by industrial societies by 90 % within 40 years. It will require an immense leap forward (“leapfrogging”) in development on a global level.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5712-7_5,"['Tschimpke, Olaf', 'Bongardt, Benjamin']",Factor X,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5712-7_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
336,A bottom-up approach to estimating cost elements of REDD+ pilot projects in Tanzania,"Background Several previous global REDD+ cost studies have been conducted, demonstrating that payments for maintaining forest carbon stocks have significant potential to be a cost-effective mechanism for climate change mitigation. These studies have mostly followed highly aggregated top-down approaches without estimating the full range of REDD+ costs elements, thus underestimating the actual costs of REDD+. Based on three REDD+ pilot projects in Tanzania, representing an area of 327,825 ha, this study explicitly adopts a bottom-up approach to data assessment. By estimating opportunity, implementation, transaction and institutional costs of REDD+ we develop a practical and replicable methodological framework to consistently assess REDD+ cost elements. Results Based on historical land use change patterns, current region-specific economic conditions and carbon stocks, project-specific opportunity costs ranged between US$ -7.8 and 28.8 tCO_xxxx for deforestation and forest degradation drivers such as agriculture, fuel wood production, unsustainable timber extraction and pasture expansion. The mean opportunity costs for the three projects ranged between US$ 10.1 – 12.5 tCO_2. Implementation costs comprised between 89% and 95% of total project costs (excluding opportunity costs) ranging between US$ 4.5 - 12.2 tCO_2 for a period of 30 years. Transaction costs for measurement, reporting, verification (MRV), and other carbon market related compliance costs comprised a minor share, between US$ 0.21 - 1.46 tCO_2. Similarly, the institutional costs comprised around 1% of total REDD+ costs in a range of US$ 0.06 – 0.11 tCO_2. Conclusions The use of bottom-up approaches to estimate REDD+ economics by considering regional variations in economic conditions and carbon stocks has been shown to be an appropriate approach to provide policy and decision-makers robust economic information on REDD+. The assessment of opportunity costs is a crucial first step to provide information on the economic baseline situation of deforestation and forest degradation agents and on the economic incentives required to halt unsustainable land use. Since performance based REDD+ carbon payments decrease over time (as deforestation rates drop and for each saved ha of forest payments occur once), investments in REDD+ implementation have a crucial role in triggering sustainable land use systems by investing in the underlying assets and the generation of sustainable revenue streams to compensate for opportunity costs of land use change. With a potential increase in the land value due to effective REDD+ investments, expenditures in an enabling institutional environment for REDD+ policies are crucial to avoid higher deforestation pressure on natural forests.",2012-08-09,10.1186/1750-0680-7-9,"['Merger, Eduard', 'Held, Christian', 'Tennigkeit, Timm', 'Blomley, Tom']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/1750-0680-7-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
337,Modelling the economic and environmental performance of engineering products: a materials selection case study,"Purpose Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies allow understanding all relevant processes and environmental impacts involved in the life cycle of products. However, in order to fully assess their sustainability, these studies should be complemented by economic (LCC) and societal analyses. In this context, the present work aims at assessing all costs (internal and external) and the environmental performance associated to the full life cycle of specific engineering products. These products are lighting columns for roadway illumination made with three different materials: a glass fibre reinforced polymer composite, steel and aluminium. Methods The LCA/LCC integrated methodology used was based in a “cradle-to-grave” assessment which considers the raw materials production, manufacture, on-site installation, use and maintenance, dismantlement and end-of-life (EoL) of the lighting columns. The fossil fuels environmental impact category was selected as the key environmental impact indicator to perform the integrated environmental and cost analysis. Results The potential total costs obtained for the full life cycle of the lighting columns demonstrated that the one made in steel performs globally worse than those made in composite or aluminium. Although the three systems present very similar internal costs, the steel column has higher external costs in the use phase that contribute for its higher total cost. This column has very high costs associated to safety features, since it constitutes a significant risk to the life of individuals. The raw material and column production stages are the main contributors for the total internal life cycle costs. The EoL treatment is a revenue source in all systems because it generates energy (in the case of the composite incineration) or materials (in the case of metal recycling). The composite and aluminium lighting columns present similar “cradle-to-grave” life cycle total cost. However, until the dismantlement phase, the aluminium column presents the highest environmental impact, whereas in the EoL treatment phase this scenario is reversed. The “cradle-to-grave” life cycle potential total cost and the environmental impact ( fossil fuels ) indicator of the steel lighting column are higher than those of the other columns. Conclusions Even though the uncertainties in the LCC are larger if external costs are included, their consideration when modelling the economic performance of engineering products increases the probability of developing a more sustainable solution from a societal perspective.",2012-07-01,10.1007/s11367-012-0414-y,"['Simões, Carla L.', 'Pinto, Lígia M.

338,The costs and benefits of white certificates schemes,"White certificate schemes mandate energy companies to promote energy efficiency with flexibility mechanisms, including the trading of energy savings. A unified framework is used to estimate the costs and benefits of the schemes implemented in Great Britain in 2002, in Italy in 2005 and in France in 2006. ‘Negawatt-hour cost’ estimates reach 0.009€/kWh saved in Great Britain and 0.037€/kWh saved in France, which compares favourably to energy prices in those countries. Moreover, the benefits of reduced energy bills and CO_2 emissions saved exceed the costs; thus, white certificate schemes pay for themselves. Overall, the policy instrument is cost-effective and economically efficient. A closer look at the differences amongst countries provides general insights about the conceptualization of the instrument: (a) Compared to utility demand-side management, to which they are related, white certificate schemes provide more transparency about energy savings, but less transparency around costs; (b) the substantial efficiency discrepancy between the British scheme and its French counterpart can be explained by differences in technological potentials, coexisting policies and supply-side systems in these countries and (c) the nature and amount of costs influence compliance strategies. Notably, if energy suppliers are allowed to set their retail price freely, they tend to grant subsidies to end-use consumers for energy efficient investments.",2012-05-01,10.1007/s12053-011-9134-6,"['Giraudet, Louis-Gaëtan', 'Bodineau, Luc', 'Finon, Dominique']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12053-011-9134-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
339,Biofuels and carbon management,"Public policy supports biofuels for their benefits to agricultural economies, energy security and the environment. The environmental rationale is premised on greenhouse gas (GHG, “carbon”) emissions reduction, which is a matter of contention. This issue is challenging to resolve because of critical but difficult-to-verify assumptions in lifecycle analysis (LCA), limits of available data and disputes about system boundaries. Although LCA has been the presumptive basis of climate policy for fuels, careful consideration indicates that it is inappropriate for defining regulations. This paper proposes a method using annual basis carbon (ABC) accounting to track the stocks and flows of carbon and other relevant GHGs throughout fuel supply chains. Such an approach makes fuel and feedstock production facilities the focus of accounting while treating the CO_2 emissions from fuel end-use at face value regardless of the origin of the fuel carbon (bio- or fossil). Integrated into cap-and-trade policy and including provisions for mitigating indirect land-use change impacts, also evaluated on an annual basis, an ABC approach would provide a sound carbon management framework for the transportation fuels sector.",2012-04-01,10.1007/s10584-011-0164-z,"['DeCicco, John M.']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-011-0164-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
340,"Influence of soil C, N_2O and fuel use on GHG mitigation with no-till adoption","Previous research has demonstrated that soil carbon sequestration through adoption of conservation tillage can be economically profitable depending on the value of a carbon offset in a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions market. However adoption of conservation tillage also influences two other potentially important factors, changes in soil N_2O emissions and CO_2 emissions attributed to changes in fuel use. In this article we evaluate the supply of GHG offsets associated with conservation tillage adoption for corn-soy-hay and wheat-pasture systems of the central United States, taking into account not only the amount of carbon sequestration but also the changes in soil N_2O emission and CO_2 emissions from fuel use in tillage operations. The changes in N_2O emissions are derived from a meta-analysis of published studies, and changes in fuel use are based on USDA data. These are used to estimate changes in global warming potential (GWP) associated with adoption of no-till practices, and the changes in GWP are then used in an economic analysis of the potential supply of GHG offsets from the region. Simulation results demonstrate that taking N_2O emissions into account could result in substantial underestimation of the potential for GHG mitigation in the central U.S. wheat pasture systems, and large over-estimation in the corn-soy-hay systems. Fuel use also has quantitatively important effects, although generally smaller than N_2O. These findings suggest that it is important to incorporate these two effects in estimates of GHG offset potential from agricultural lands, as well as in the design of GHG offset contracts for more complete accounting of the effect that no-till adoption will have on greenhouse gas emissions.",2012-04-01,10.1007/s10584-011-0193-7,"['Antle, John M.', 'Ogle, Stephen M.']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-011-0193-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
341,Short-Run Allocation of Emissions Allowances and Long-Term Goals for Climate Policy,"We use economic analysis to evaluate grandfathering, auctioning, and benchmarking approaches for allocation of emissions allowances and then discuss practical experience from European and American schemes. In principle, auctions are superior from the viewpoints of efficiency, fairness, transparency, and simplicity. In practice, auctions have been opposed by important sectors of industry, which argue that carbon pricing without compensation would harm international competitiveness. In the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, this concern led to grandfathering that is updated at various intervals. Unfortunately, updating gives industry an incentive to change behavior to influence future allocation. Furthermore, the wealth transferred to incumbent firms can be significantly larger than the extra costs incurred, leading to windfall profits. Meanwhile, potential auction revenues are not available to reduce other taxes. By circumscribing free allocation, benchmarking can target competitiveness concerns, incur less wealth transfer, and provide a strategy consistent with transitioning to auctions in the long run.",2012-02-01,10.1007/s13280-011-0238-1,"['Zetterberg, Lars', 'Wråke, Markus', 'Sterner, Thomas', 'Fischer, Carolyn', 'Burtraw, Dallas']",AMBIO,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13280-011-0238-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

347,Emissions Trading,"Climate change is being exacerbated by the emissions of globe-warming greenhouse gases (GHGs) as a consequence of economic activities associated with energy, industry, transportation, and land use. From an economic viewpoint, the Earth’s climate is a public good , and pollution a negative externality ; such change therefore constitutes market failure . Controlling air pollution by utilizing economic mechanisms represents an important change in environmental thinking – literally a paradigm shift away from historical command-and-control (CAC) engineering systems. Today, this new approach is being utilized to mitigate the emissions of GHGs, addressing the pollution externality by putting a price on carbon. The international carbon market, largely developed as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, had a total value of $144 billion in 2009. The largest component of that market, the European Union’s Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), was worth $118 billion; it represents a regional market designed to assist Europe in achieving compliance with the Protocol’s requirements, and also has links to the Protocol’s project-based mechanisms, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI) which help minimize compliance costs.

Further, other carbon markets created in numerous countries (e.g., the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative [RGGI] in the USA and the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme in New South Wales, Australia) were worth $2.3 billion, while the global voluntary market was estimated to be in the $350–$400 million range (a significant drop from the previous year’s $700 million figure).

348,Emission Trading and Market Access of Renewables,"In this chapter we look at the impact of different carbon emission prices combined with the Real-Time Pricing (RTP) to the promotion of renewable energy (wind) to enter the Nordic power market. We show that regardless of the carbon price the amount of wind entering to the market increases with the share of the consumers on RTP. The amount of wind entering to the market is also really increasing with the emission permit price. The increase in the amount of wind power is shown also as reduced emissions of carbon dioxide. The reduction is bigger the higher is the emission price. The decrease in emissions is strengthening as the share of the customers in RTP increases. Notably, even though wind power is entering to the market as the carbon price increases we do not reach the aggregate national target level for wind power even with very high carbon price at least if we assume risk averse wind power investors. Consequently if we want to see high levels of installed wind power capacity also other support mechanisms are needed.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4471-2972-1_6,"['Kopsakangas-Savolainen, Maria', 'Svento, Rauli']",Modern Energy Markets,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-2972-1_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
349,"Grassland Soil Organic Carbon Stocks: Status, Opportunities, Vulnerability","Grasslands, including rangelands, shrublands, pastureland, and cropland sown with pasture and fodder crops, covered approximately 3.5 billion ha in 2000. This represented 26% of the global ice-free land area and 70% of the agricultural area, and contained about 20% of the world’s soil organic carbon (C) stocks. People rely heavily upon grasslands for food and forage production. Around 20% of the world’s native grasslands have been converted to cultivated crops, and significant portions of milk and beef production occurs on grasslands managed solely for those purposes. The livestock industry – largely based on grasslands – provides livelihoods for about one billion of the world’s poorest people and provides one-third of global protein intake. Much of the world’s grasslands are under pressure to produce more livestock by grazing more intensively, particularly in Africa’s rangelands, which are vulnerable to climate change and expected to satisfy most of the beef and milk demand in Africa. As a result of past practices, between 5% and 10% of the world’s grasslands have been degraded by overgrazing. Portions of the grasslands on every continent have been degraded due to human activities with about 7.5% of grassland having been degraded because of overgrazing. More recently, the Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands (LADA) concluded that about 16% of rangelands are currently undergoing degradation and that rangelands comprise 20–25% of total land area currently being degraded affecting the livelihood of over 1.5 billion people. Disturbance is an integral part of traditional grassland management systems to sustain yields of forage. However, disturbance through overgrazing, fire, and invasive species can also deplete grassland systems of C stocks. Harvesting a large proportion of plant biomass enhances yields of useful material (e.g., for forage or fuel), but decreases C inputs to the soil. Many management techniques intended to increase livestock forage production have the potential to increase soil C stocks by sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide(CO_2) – as much as 0.2–0.8 Pg CO_2 year^−1. Methods of improved management include fertilization, irrigation, intensive grazing management, and sowing of more favorable forage grasses and legumes. Grassland management to enhance production (i.e., through sowing improved species, irrigation or fertilization), to minimize negative impacts of grazing, or to rehabilitate degraded lands can each lead to C sequestration. Improved grazing management (i.e., management that increases production) can also lead to an increase of soil C stocks as can rehabilitation of degraded lands.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-4159-1_13,"['Conant, Richard Theodore']",Recarbonization of the Biosphere,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-4159-1_13,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
350,Promotion of Renewables and Energy Efficiency by Politics: Case Study of the European Union,"Since climate change has become an international concern, most of the developed countries have attempted to adopt energy policies to mitigate global warming and its side effects in the last years. The current energy model, based on fossil fuels and nuclear energy, has been the basis for the functioning and development of modern industrial society. Nevertheless, the threats of this model (environmental problems, exhaustion of fossil sources, possible inflation process and loss of competitiveness, dependency toward energy export countries, etc.) have forced a change in the EU’s traditional energy strategy (which was focused on the security of supply). The present energy model of the European Union, which supports its economic growth and prosperity, is 80% dependent on fossils fuels [ 1 ] and it is increasingly dependent on energy imported from Non-EU member countries, creating economic, social, political, and other risks for the Union. From the 1990s, the key objectives of the EU have been security of supply, competitiveness, and environmental protection, making renewable energy sources and energy efficiency the basis for its new energy strategy in the EU. However the lack of a common energy framework seems to have been an obstacle to reach those objectives. Therefore, the European Union has recently adopted new directives and instruments to create a unique energy framework in order to reach the mentioned targets but also to become the world leader in the impulse of renewable energy sources and in the employment of energy efficiency technologies. In this work the main problems of the conventional energy model (CEM) are explained. The basis, obstacles, and challenges for implementing a more sustainable energy model are also analyzed. Likewise, due to the strategic importance of the European Union leadership in developing and implementing new instruments and policies to mitigate climate change, this work is focused in its energy strategy. Thus, the recent energy directives and other measures adopted by the EU are discussed.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4419-7991-9_9,"['Martínez de Alegría Mancisidor, Itziar', 'Vicente Molina, M.

351,Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading in the Electricity Sector: Model Formulation and Case Studies,"Models formulated as complementarity problems have been applied previously to assess the potential for market power and costs of environmental regulation in transmission-constrained electricity markets. One emerging use of these models is to study the impacts of cap-and-trade (C&T) policies on electricity markets. In this chapter, we first summarize the theoretical background on the choice of environmental instruments to regulate emissions from the power sector. The chapter then presents a mathematical formulation of a power market that incorporates a carbon dioxide C&T program. We illustrate the capability of the model by presenting the results from two analyses. The first analysis examines the impact of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) on the northwestern European electricity market. The second study investigates the energy and emissions implications of Maryland’s decision to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) by nesting a regional power sector model within a national model. In both cases, the larger firms in the electric market are modeled as Cournot oligopolists who pursue a quantity strategy while at the same time they act competitively in the C&T programs and transmission markets. We demonstrate how complementarity-based power market models can be easily modified to incorporate details of alternative policy designs.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-27431-2_3,"['Chen, Yihsu', 'Lise, Wietze', 'Sijm, Jos', 'Hobbs, Benjamin F.']",Handbook of CO₂ in Power Systems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-27431-2_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
352,Decisions Under Uncertainty in Municipal Solid Waste Cogeneration Investments,"The issue of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management is an ever increasing problem for all countries. Developed countries face the problem of dealing with very large amounts of MSW per capita, forcing them to develop new technologies and systems. On the other hand, countries with developing or transitional economies may generate lower amounts of MSW per capita, but the rate of increase is high and the current practices of MSW management are not as advanced as those of developed countries. Therefore, countries with developing or transitional economies may benefit from adopting MSW management technologies used by developed economies. One aspect of MSW management in developed economies is the energy recovery from MSW. The advantages of this type of technologies are mainly the significantly reduced waste volume for landfilling, the reduction of total greenhouse gas emissions, the potential for generating electricity or co-generation of electricity and heat. In this work, a comparative study of the most prominent co-generation technologies using MSW as a fuel source is presented, focusing on the evolution of their economical performance over time. An algorithm based on real-options has been applied for four technologies of MSW energy recovery: (1) incineration, (2) gasification, (3) landfill biogas exploitation using a pipeline system and (4) anaerobic digestion facilities. The financial contributors are identified and the impact of greenhouse gas trading is analyzed in terms of financial yields, considering landfilling as the baseline scenario. The greenhouse gas trading system presents an opportunity for investing in environmentally friendly technologies for MSW energy recovery, through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), in most developing countries. The results of this work indicate an advantage of combined heat and power over solely electricity generation. The most attractive technology among the ones examined proves to be incineration, mainly due to its higher power production efficiency, lower investment costs and lower emission rates. Despite the fact that these characteristics may not drastically change over time, either immediate or irreversible investment decisions might be reconsidered under the current selling prices of heat, power and CO_2 allowances.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4471-2306-4_8,"['Tolis, Athanasios', 'Rentizelas, Athanasios', 'Aravossis, Konstantin', 'Tatsiopoulos, Ilias']",Waste to Energy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-2306-4_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

Part A examines the legal structure of the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register under Regulation (EC) 166/2006 in detail. Therefore, it discusses its legislative background, the actual content of the Regulation and its relationship to Regulation (EC) 1907/2006, commonly referred to as REACH. Part B examines the confidentiality mechanism implemented under the Regulation (EC) 166/2006. The legal reference to Directive 2003/4/EC 3 is at the very heart of this analysis. Relevant judgments of the ECJ and the CFI support the analysis to realign the boundaries of the interpretation of confidentiality. Part C examines the role of the EEA and enforcement mechanisms. Therefore it discusses the current legal status of the EEA and puts this into context with the tasks which the EEA is obliged to perform under Regulation (EC) 166/2006. It also discusses the access to legal instruments for enforcement with regard to mandatory disclosure of environmental information. Part D describes the right of access to environmental information for other pollutants not covered under E-PRTR and E-PRTR ancillary documents at EU level. Therefore it discusses the relevant Treaty provisions, secondary EU law and case-law.

354,"Fuel Taxes, Fuel Economy of Vehicles and Costs of Conserved Energy: The Case of the European Union","This chapter is an overview of the changes in real-world fuel economy in key countries and of recent developments in fuel taxes imposed on all fuels across the EU-Member States. Coal and gas are undertaxed but diesel and gasoline are overtaxed; however, fuel economy is directly affected by fuel taxes (prices) and not by taxes on coal. Standards on fuel economy can be interpreted as taxes on fuel and both standards and fuel taxes can be triggers for investment in alternative energy technology. Costs of conserved energy show that hybrid trucks are cost-effective to buy for freight transport operators so long as fuel costs are high. Trends in the cost of conserved energy are likely to favour investment in fuel saving technologies so long as fuel and oil prices remain high as is currently the case. Taxes on fossil fuels are one way to save fossil fuels and EU Governments are aware of the need to save fossil fuels and to reduce dependency on them. EU fuel taxes have led to improved fuel economy on EU roads.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4471-2717-8_15,"['Bonilla, David']","Energy, Transport, & the Environment",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-2717-8_15,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
355,Incorporating Life-Cycle Economic and Environmental Factors in Managerial Decision-Making,"Recent environmental trends, including (1) an expansion of existing command and control directives, (2) the introduction of market-based policy instruments, and (3) the adoption of extended producer responsibility, have created a need for new tools to help managerial decision-making. To address this need, we develop a nonlinear mathematical programming model from a profit-maximizing firm’s perspective, which can be tailored as a decision-support tool for firms facing environmental goals and constraints. We typify our approach using the specific context of diesel engine manufacturing and remanufacturing. The approach allows the incorporation of traditional operations planning considerations—in particular, capacity, production, and inventory—together with environmental considerations that range from product design through production to product end of life. A current hurdle to implementing such a model is the availability of input data. We therefore highlight the need to involve all departments within businesses and for industrial ecologists Industrial ecology and business managers to work together to implement meaningful decision models that are based on accurate and timely data and can have positive economic and environmental impact.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4419-6105-1_14,"['Subramanian, Ravi']",Sustainable Supply Chains,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-6105-1_14,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

357,The Negotiation Process to Include International Aviation in a Post-2012 Climate Regime,"In the past, negotiating climate policies to limit emissions from international aviation has proven to be exceedingly difficult. However, with the rapprochement of developing and industrialized countries in the face of a growing and evident need for adaptation and mitigation, positions are changing and new options to include aviation in a global climate regime are arguable. Against the background of the general political framework for a post-2012 climate regime, this article highlights the sector-specific challenges caused by the non-national nature of the sector and the current institutional setting. The paper presents possible options to include international aviation in a binding global climate regime and relates them to the negotiation positions of different actors. Special attention is paid to the global sectoral approach in international aviation coupled with the possibility of raising revenues for adaptation to climate change in developing countries. The paper comes to the conclusion that a global sectoral approach with climate financing could be the key to resolving the political deadlock between the need for effective global mitigation measures involving all global key operators and the need for a differentiated treatment of countries according to their capability and responsibility for climate change.",2011-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-20592-7_6,"['Deuber, Odette']",Emissions Trading,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-20592-7_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

It is argued that emission trading may be relevant in this sector, and that hybrid instruments combining tradable permits with taxation may be particularly efficient. Moreover, there is no sound reason to dismiss downstream trading in principle on the basis of their potentially high transaction costs because of the large number of mobile sources to deal with. Downstream schemes are presented, which are feasible both on technical and institutional grounds. Regarding the need to coordinate transport emissions reduction at the international level, and especially regarding international transport, it is argued that emission trading in transport could be quickly implemented contrary to harmonisation of fuel taxation.

367,The economic impact of the upcoming EU emissions trading system on airlines and EU Member States—an empirical estimation,"Purpose In February 2009, the European Union’s (EU) Directive for the inclusion of aviation into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) for CO_2-emissions came into force. From 2012 onwards, the EU-ETS will cover virtually all flights departing or arriving in the EU. As aircraft operators (i.e. airlines) will be required to hold emission allowances for all flights that are subject to the EU-ETS, the economical impacts of the system are currently being discussed. This paper aims at estimating and analysing the economical impact of the EU-ETS on the aviation sector in total, on selected groups of airlines and on the administering states. Materials and methods This paper describes a simulation model for the economical impact of the EU-ETS. According to current plans, the initial allocation of emission allowances to airlines will be based on a benchmark which is calculated by dividing the 2004–2006 CO_2-emissions by the transport performance of the year 2010. The simulation model calculates CO_2 emissions and transport performance of European aviation for the timeframe 2004–2012. The approach is based on flight schedules for passenger and cargo air traffic coupled to an aircraft performance module. By use of this model, the benchmark and hence the initial allocation of emission allowances to airlines can be estimated. Using assumptions on the development of the CO_2 allowance price, the economical impacts of the EU-ETS can be discussed. Results and discussion The economic effects of the upcoming EU-ETS on the aviation sector in total, on selected groups of airlines and on the administering states are analysed and discussed. It is shown that additional to the freely allocated allowances, nearly all aircraft operators need to purchase allowances for about one third of their emissions in 2012. The total cost for the aviation sector is expected to be in the range between 1.9 and 3.0 billion € in 2012. Certain airline groups and administering EU States will be affected very differently by the new EU legislation. It is shown that particularly European network carriers will be affected by a competitive disadvantage compared to non-EU airlines.",2010-12-01,10.1007/s12544-010-0038-x,"['Schaefer, Martin', 'Scheelhaase, Janina', 'Grimme, Wolfgang', 'Maertens, Sven']",European Transport Research Review,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12544-010-0038-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

369,"The U.S. proposed carbon tariffs, WTO scrutiny and China’s responses","With governments from around the world trying to hammer out a post-2012 climate change agreement, no one would disagree that a U.S. commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions is essential to such a global pact. However, despite U.S. president Obama’s announcement to push for a commitment to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 17% by 2020, in reality it is questionable whether U.S. Congress will agree to specific emissions cuts, although they are not ambitious at all from the perspectives of both the EU and developing countries, without the imposition of carbon tariffs on Chinese products to the U.S. market, even given China’s own announcement to voluntarily seek to reduce its carbon intensity by 40–45% over the same period. This dilemma is partly attributed to flaws in current international climate negotiations, which have been focused on commitments on the two targeted dates of 2020 and 2050. However, if the international climate change negotiations continue on their current course without extending the commitment period to 2030, which would really open the possibility for the U.S. and China to make the commitments that each wants from the other, the inclusion of border carbon adjustment measures seems essential to secure passage of any U.S. legislation capping its own greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the joint WTO-UNEP report indicates that border carbon adjustment measures might be allowed under the existing WTO rules, depending on their specific design features and the specific conditions for implementing them. Against this background, this paper argues that, on the U.S. side, there is a need to minimize the potential conflicts with WTO provisions in designing such border carbon adjustment measures. The U.S. also needs to explore, with its trading partners, ccooperative sectoral approaches to advancing low-carbon technologies and/or concerted mitigation efforts in a given sector at the international level. Moreover, to increase the prospects for a successful WTO defence of the Waxman-Markey type of border adjustment provision, there should be: 1) a period of good faith efforts to reach agreements among the countries concerned before imposing such trade measures; 2) consideration of alternatives to trade provisions that could reasonably be expected to fulfill the same function but are not inconsistent or less inconsistent with the relevant WTO provisions; and 3) trade provisions that should allow importers to submit equivalent emission reduction units that are recognized by international treaties to cover the carbon contents of imported products. Meanwhile, being targeted by such border carbon adjustment measures, China needs to, at the right time, indicate a serious commitment to address climate change issues to challenge the legitimacy of the U.S. imposing carbon tariffs by signaling well ahead that it will take on binding absolute emission caps around the year 2030, and needs the three transitional periods of increasing climate obligations before taking on absolute emissions caps. This paper argues that there is a clear need within a climate regime to define comparable efforts towards climate mitigation and adaptation to discipline the use of unilateral trade measures at the international level. As exemplified by export tariffs that China applied on its own during 2006–08, the paper shows that defining the comparability of climate efforts can be to China’s advantage. Furthermore, given the fact that, in volume terms, energy-intensive manufacturing in China values 7 to 8 times that of India, and thus carbon tariffs have a greater impact on China than on India, the paper questions whether China should hold the same stance on this issue as India as it does now, although the two largest developing countries should continue to take a common position on other key issues in international climate change negotiations.",2010-08-01,10.1007/s10368-010-0166-8,"['Zhang, ZhongXiang']",International Economics and Economic Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10368-010-0166-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
370,The potential for CO_2 emissions trading in transport: the case of personal vehicles and freight,"Transport currently accounts for around 25–30% of global CO_2 emissions and this contribution is growing rapidly. Moreover, road transport holds by far the major part in these emissions. Because of the social and political reluctance to increase fuel taxation, it is of some interest to explore the inclusion of road transport in emission trading schemes. Starting from the theory about tradable permits, their relevance in transport emissions, their appropriate targets and their potential for practical implementation are analysed. Two proposals of “tradable rights for fuel consumption” are presented, the one for drivers of private vehicles, the other for freight transportation. Finally, potential pitfalls and implementation issues are also discussed. It is concluded that the cost of operating markets of fuel rights would be the price to be paid for an effective involvement of the transport sector in the effort to reduce emissions.",2010-05-01,10.1007/s12053-009-9065-7,"['Raux, Charles']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12053-009-9065-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
371,In or out: efficient inclusion of installations in an emissions trading scheme?,"Regulators around the world are currently considering national emissions trading schemes (ETS) as cost-effective instruments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the process, they are confronted with numerous design issues. The coverage of installations in an ETS is one such issue. While “blanket coverage” that includes all industrial emitters of greenhouse gases in an economy has some intuitive appeal, and seems equitable, it does not take into full account all the costs related to the extent of coverage. This paper shows that an alternative approach of “partial coverage” based on benefit–cost analysis can achieve the same emission reduction outcome at lower social cost. The approach is based on maximizing the benefits from inclusion of installations in an ETS at the same time as taking all relevant transaction costs into account. A broad definition of transaction costs is used, which covers the regulatory costs to the government as well as regulatory costs imposed on covered installations. We find that particularly for relatively modest emissions reduction targets the cost savings of a “partial coverage” compared to “blanket coverage” are significant.",2010-04-01,10.1007/s11149-009-9109-0,"['Betz, Regina', 'Sanderson, Todd', 'Ancev, Tihomir']",Journal of Regulatory Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11149-009-9109-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
372,Land-based carbon storage and the European union emissions trading scheme: the science underlying the policy,"Climate change is occurring with greater speed and intensity that previously anticipated. All effective environmentally and socially sound mitigation efforts need to be employed to effectively address this global crisis. Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) projects can provide significant climate change mitigation benefits as well as poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation benefits. The policies of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), the world’s largest carbon market exclude LULUCF. Scientific support for this exclusion was presented in a briefing paper published by the Climate Action Network—Europe (CAN) that puts forward the proposition that land based storage of carbon is ineffective. A careful review of the scientific papers cited in support of CAN’s position indicates that, while the papers themselves are scientifically sound, they do not support the continued exclusion of LULUCF projects from the EU-ETS. At the same time some important recent research papers that describe the carbon storage and social benefit potential of such projects are not included in the analysis. An in-depth consideration of the scientific evidence is necessary in evaluating this policy option. Based on this evidence a case can be made for the inclusion of LULUCF projects in the EU-ETS.",2010-02-01,10.1007/s11027-009-9202-9,"['Haskett, Jonathan', 'Schlamadinger, Bernhard', 'Brown, Sandra']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-009-9202-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
373,Competitive Markets for Pollution Permits: Impact on Factor Income and International Equilibrium,"We are interested in the impact of pollution permits on wages and profits. We analyze important consequences of introducing a market of pollution permits. A fundamental issue concerns the initial allocation of such permits: should they be allocated freely by grandfathering or be auctioned. The international symmetric case allows us to capture the essence of the problem on income factor. We show that allocating permits to factors in proportion of their contribution to production leads to an efficient (neoclassical) distribution. Considering the international asymmetric case, we show that a permit market does not modify the competitive world equilibrium without permits when the total allocation is large enough. When it is not, if allocation of permits is not proportional to the emissions in the world without permits, there is a reduction factor of emissions that results from the equilibrium allocation of capital.",2010-02-01,10.1007/s10666-009-9195-5,"['Jouvet, Pierre-André', 'Michel, Philippe', 'Rotillon, Gilles']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10666-009-9195-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

375,Interaction between EU carbon trading and the international climate regime: synergies and learning,"This article discusses the developing interaction and cross-scale effects between the company-focused EU emissions trading (ETS) and the country-focused international climate regime, in particular the Kyoto Protocol. Key questions discussed are first, what has been the character of selected interactions so far—synergistic or disruptive? Second, what kinds of interaction mechanisms have been driving the interactions; normative, cognitive, or utilitarian? Third, with regard to cross-scale effects, has significant learning taken place between institutions at different levels? Four sub-cases of interaction are analysed: first, the interaction between the Kyoto Protocol as source and the ETS as target which started after the adoption of the Protocol in late 1997. Second, a next phase of interaction started in 2004 when the EU states started to develop national allocation plans (NAPs) where bringing in credits/allowances developed under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) became one compliance strategy. Third, the opposite relationship is examined, i.e., with the ETS as the source and the Kyoto Protocol institutions as targets. The first phase started after the adoption of the 2003 ET Directive and with the developing ETS possibly leading to a more rapid and extensive CDM development than would otherwise have been the case. Fourth and finally, a separate case of interaction deals with the possible role the ETS plays and could play for an emerging global carbon market. Key findings are that these cases are mainly of a synergistic nature. Furthermore, in order to understand the driving forces, it is necessary to draw upon several interaction mechanisms, particularly cognitive and utilitarian ones. Finally, as to cross-scale learning, the post-2012 global regime may avoid pitfalls related to the allocation process experienced by the ETS.

376,Energy prices and emissions trading: windfall profits from grandfathering?,"The greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the European Union primarily uses grandfathering until 2012, which means that polluters get emission rights free of charge based on their historical emissions. Energy consumers accuse energy producers of making windfall profits by incorporating the market value of those free rights into the energy prices. However, we develop a numerical example to illustrate that the reasoning of the producers is correct. We also explain why this market value is only partly passed on to consumers. We consider various measures and conclude that only auctioning the rights after 2012 nullifies the additional profits.",2009-10-01,10.1007/s10657-009-9098-6,"['Woerdman, E.', 'Couwenberg, O.', 'Nentjes, A.']",European Journal of Law and Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10657-009-9098-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
377,Permit Trading and Credit Trading: A Comparison of Cap-Based and Rate-Based Emissions Trading Under Perfect and Imperfect Competition,"This paper compares emissions trading based on a cap on total emissions (permit trading) and on relative standards per unit of output (credit trading). Two types of market structure are considered: perfect competition and Cournot oligopoly. We find that output, abatement costs and the number of firms are higher under credit trading. Allowing trade between permit-trading and credit-trading sectors may increase welfare. With perfect competition, permit trading always leads to higher welfare than credit trading. With imperfect competition, credit trading may outperform permit trading. Environmental policy can lead to exit, but also to entry of firms. Entry and exit have a profound impact on the performance of the schemes, especially under imperfect competition. We find that it may be impossible to implement certain levels of total industry emissions. Under credit trading several levels of the relative standard can achieve the same total level of emissions.",2009-09-01,10.1007/s10640-009-9266-8,"['Boom, Jan-Tjeerd', 'Dijkstra, Bouwe R.']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-009-9266-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
378,Origins and Development of the EU ETS,"The successful creation of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) was not inevitable. Countries such as Canada and Japan which might be thought to have a less complex and more cohesive cultural and institutional context failed to do so. Europe succeeded for a number of reasons: with a Single Market for the economy, the logic of a single market for environment is inexorable; the European Commission—which had failed in its earlier efforts to introduce a carbon energy tax—made the case for trading with great skill and persistence, on the basis of qualified majority voting, which meant no country had a veto; the UK and Denmark initiated their own national schemes, and there was a serious risk of balkanising the market with up to 27 different schemes, with the losses of scale and scope this would entail; meeting the Union’s Kyoto commitments required a substantive pan European response, and EU ETS was the most credible and effective way of doing so. The European Parliament and Environmental Non Governmental Organisations played a constructive role, pushing for more auctioning of allowances and less of them, allocated centrally. Free allocation managed by Member States (MS) was a necessary condition to achieve the support needed, so they failed to achieve these objectives in the initial phase, but they characterize the Commission’s proposals post 2012.",2009-07-01,10.1007/s10640-009-9275-7,"['Convery, Frank J.']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-009-9275-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
379,Advancing the climate regime through linking domestic emission trading systems?,"More and more countries are incorporating the instrument of emissions trading into their national climate policies. This emerging mosaic of emissions trading schemes (ETS) raises the question of whether they should be linked with each other. From an economic point of view, linking of domestic schemes is supposed to increase the economic efficiency of carbon markets. In addition, linking is also expected by some to yield substantial political benefits in terms of the evolution of the UNFCCC/Kyoto regime. However, these optimistic prospects are based on a best-case scenario where all major countries establish environmentally effective emissions trading systems and then link them with each other. Real-life politics might develop rather differently. This paper therefore examines to what extent the current status of emissions trading in industrialised countries provides a basis for reinforcing and moving forward the international climate regime through linking domestic ETS. After comparing emerging emissions trading schemes from an institutional perspective, it emerges that not only emissions trading is at a very early stage in most countries, in addition the emerging systems are probably going to be designed very differently from the EU ETS. While for some design features such as the coverage design differences do not matter, there are some areas where the plans in many non-EU countries look crucially different from the EU system. The outlook for a linked international ETS is therefore currently still very uncertain. Given this state of affairs, the EU should pro-actively engage with the non-EU countries to try to harmonise their developing national emissions trading schemes with the EU ETS, widely disseminate the lessons it has learned from the EU ETS, strongly make the case for environmental integrity and at the same time make clear that systems that want to link to the EU ETS will need to meet certain quality criteria.",2009-06-01,10.1007/s11027-009-9178-5,"['Sterk, Wolfgang', 'Schüle, Ralf']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-009-9178-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
380,Linking Russia with the European and global greenhouse gas emissions trading markets: three paths for greening the Russian assigned amount under the Kyoto Protocol,"This article examines possibilities for linkage between the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and Russia, with a view to enhancing cooperation on a broader scale than the project-based approaches that have been tested thus far. Three paths for possible EU-Russia linkage are presented by which the Russian Assigned Amount under the Kyoto Protocol can be greened in order to stimulate emissions trading: 1. Joint implementation—reductions earned via individual projects in Russia; 2. Greened allowances or green investment schemes; and 3. Linked cap-and-trade systems, in which a Russian domestic emissions trading system would link with the European Union Emissions Trading System. The authors conclude that the third option, emissions trading through linked domestic emissions trading systems, offers the best opportunities at the lowest transaction costs.

381,Ensuring the environmental effectiveness of linked emissions trading schemes over time,"Linking emissions trading schemes allows the combined emissions cap to be achieved at lower cost. Linking is usually environmentally neutral, but some design features can lead to higher aggregate emissions if schemes are linked. Technical solutions to limit the potential emissions increases due to design differences implemented when schemes are linked are not sufficient to ensure the environmental effectiveness of the linked schemes over time. Technological, economic, administrative and other changes that can lead to higher aggregate emissions are inevitable. The administrators of the linked schemes must ensure the stringency of the emissions cap relative to the “business as usual” emissions of affected sources, the accuracy of the emissions reported by affected sources, the integrity of the allowance registry, effective compliance enforcement, and the environmental integrity of the credits issued for emission reduction projects over time. This will require a process for agreeing on revisions to the regulations of the linked schemes, a mechanism to provide assurance of the environmental effectiveness of each of the linked schemes, and a procedure for terminating the linking agreement.",2009-06-01,10.1007/s11027-009-9176-7,"['Haites, E.', 'Wang, X.']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-009-9176-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

384,Biomass District Energy Trigeneration Systems: Emissions Reduction and Financial Impact,"Biomass cogeneration is widely used for district heating applications in central and northern Europe. Biomass trigeneration on the other hand, constitutes an innovative renewable energy application. In this work, an approved United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change baseline methodology has been extended to allow the examination of biomass trigeneration applications. The methodology is applied to a case study in Greece to investigate various environmental and financial aspects of this type of applications. The results suggest that trigeneration may lead to significant emissions reduction compared to using fossil fuels or even biomass cogeneration and electricity generation. The emissions reduction achieved may be materialized into a considerable revenue stream for the project, if traded through a trading mechanism such as the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to compensate for the high volatility of the emission allowances’ value and the immaturity of the EU Trading Scheme, which prevent a reliable estimation of the related revenue. The work concludes that emission allowances trading may develop into one of the major revenue streams of biomass trigeneration projects, significantly increasing their financial yield and attractiveness. The impact on the yield is significant even for low future values of emission allowances and could become the main income revenue source of such projects, if emission allowances increase their value substantially. The application of trigeneration for district energy proves to lead to increased environmental and financial benefits compared to the cogeneration or electricity generation cases.",2009-04-01,10.1007/s11267-008-9202-x,"['Rentizelas, A.', 'Tolis, A.', 'Tatsiopoulos, I.']","Water, Air, & Soil Pollution: Focus",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11267-008-9202-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

The history of the regime tracks its evolution through the IPCC, the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, and its implementation. The section on mitigation describes the emission reduction targets in the Kyoto Protocol and the various mechanisms available to meet these targets. The adaptation section considers provisions in the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, and their implementation to date. The final section considers the future of the regime and the promise it holds for addressing arctic concerns over the adequacy of mitigation, adaptive capacity, and the specific vulnerability of this region.

387,"Payments for Ecosystem Services, Poverty and Sustainability: The Case of Agricultural Soil Carbon Sequestration","This chapter explores the potential impacts of payments for ecosystem services on poverty and sustainability of farm households, using the example of agricultural soil carbon sequestration. Economic analysis shows that there is a variety of technical and economic factors affecting adoption of practices that increase soil carbon and their impacts on poverty, hence, the net effect of these factors is an empirical question. The evidence suggests that carbon payments could have a positive impact on the sustainability of production systems while also raising incomes and reducing poverty. However, carbon contracts are found to have only modest impacts on poverty, even at relatively high carbon prices. Moreover, the participation of poor farmers in carbon contracts is likely to be constrained by the same economic and institutional factors that have inhibited their use of more productive, more sustainable practices in the first place. Thus, payments for ecosystem services are most likely to have a positive impact on poverty and sustainability when they are implemented in an enabling economic and institutional environment.",2009-01-01,10.1007/978-0-387-72971-8_7,"['Antle, John M.', 'Stoorvogel, Jetse J.']",Payment for Environmental Services in Agricultural Landscapes,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-0-387-72971-8_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

The acknowledgement of the various market imperfections, however, does not endorse automatically the use of various instruments, such as tradable white certificates (TWC). Therefore, it is necessary to clarify under what conditions a TWC system can have equal or superior effectiveness and economic efficiency as compared to other instruments. The article explains the principles of a TWC system in terms of market functioning and price formation. It also highlights some key assumptions regarding additionality of energy savings, transaction cost, free riding, target setting and regulatory predictability. Subsequently, the paper illustrates how a TWC system interacts with other energy efficiency policy instruments, in particular standards and taxes. After these explanatory sections the article turns to the modelling of actual TWC price formation in selected countries and subsequently presents a comparative assessment of a TWC system with an energy tax for Finland and the Netherlands.",2008-11-01,10.1007/s12053-008-9020-z,"['Perrels, Adriaan']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12053-008-9020-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
392,Implementing EU emissions trading: success or failure?,"This article assesses and explains the implementation of the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS). It argues that implementation in terms of ambitiousness has been only moderately successful so far, but significant differences between the Member States are also observed. Similarities and differences are then explained within a multi-level governance approach emphasizing the need to search for explanations at national, EU, and global levels. The EU ETS case shows that the multi-level governance approach can be as relevant for understanding implementation as for explaining policy-making. In addition to factors located at the national level, the decentralized nature of the EU scheme itself is important for understanding how the system works in practice. At the global level, the link to the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol is particularly important for determining how well the EU ETS will perform in the future.",2008-09-01,10.1007/s10784-008-9068-4,"['Skjærseth, Jon Birger', 'Wettestad, Jørgen']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-008-9068-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
393,Restricting the import of ‘emission credits’ in the EU: a power struggle between states and institutions,"This article examines the development of a cap on the use of so-called ‘project credits’ in the EU emissions trading scheme. It investigates how the issue of such a limit was addressed in the negotiations of the Linking Directive, and how it has been dealt with in the later implementation of this directive. The article applies two explanatory approaches: one based on intergovernmentalist theory, assuming that the cap reflected the preferences of the EU Member States; and one based on the multi-level governance model, assuming that the cap expressed the preferences of EU institutions rather than Member States. What is found is a two-stage development: during the negotiations of the Linking Directive, Member States managed to secure a no-cap solution allowing extensive use of the project credits. In the later implementation phase, however, when the emissions trading scheme was up and running and a certain legitimacy for the system had been established, the Commission managed to ‘regain control’ by bringing back a cap. Thus, the project credit cap—and by that, the very nature of the EU emissions trading scheme—has been the subject of a continuing power struggle within the EU—and different theoretical perspectives explain different stages of this process.",2008-08-09,10.1007/s10784-008-9081-7,"['Flåm, Karoline Hægstad']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-008-9081-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

I find that environmental organisations lobby less than what would be considered rational according to the simple rational choice model, and argue that this might largely be explained by tight budget constraints. I also find that business organisations lobby more than what would be considered rational according to the model, and argue that this might be explained if one applies a long-term perspective on rational lobbying in the policy field rather than a short-term perspective on single policy decisions. Moreover, I find that the type of lobbying differs. While environmental organisations focus on single policy decisions, business organisations also invest in general lobbying. The analysis is based on interviews with interest organisations lobbying in the field of climate policy at the European Union (EU) level.",2008-06-01,10.1007/s10784-008-9067-5,"['Gullberg, Anne Therese']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-008-9067-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
395,A framework on interactions of climate and energy policy instruments,"In this paper we analyze the concept of interactions between policy instruments addressing environmental, energy and climate change issues. Although discussion on such policies has been taking place for almost two decades, their interactions are not so sufficiently explored. Initially, we refer to literature on various types of interactions and we classify them. Furthermore, we construct a qualitative method that can assist policymakers in selecting an optimal policy mix. This method breaks down into numerous components, the areas where different policies interact, and facilitates the unveiling of potential overlaps and complementarities. These areas consist of categories as measure identification, objectives, scope, market arrangements, market flexibility, financing, technological parameters, timing, compliance parameters and institutional setup. In addition, it renders the possibility of combining different options and design elements of policies. Furthermore, a list of various criteria serves as an assessment tool for interactions, where a weighing factor and uncertainty parameters have been added, in order to produce an aggregate indicator of the ex-ante analysis of the policy mix selected. Through this method, we present a complete framework of discernment of diverse forms of environmental policy instruments.",2008-02-01,10.1007/s11027-007-9082-9,"['Oikonomou, V.', 'Jepma, C.

Rather, it operates as a proactive and authoritative regional collective of affluent democracies that can influence policymaking in significant ways at the regional and international levels. This unique position also means that EU policy-making is subject to multiple pressures from both these levels.

397,"The influence of the allocation method on market liquidity, volatility and firms’ investment decisions","When taking incomplete information and risk into account, it is likely that the primary allocation method has an impact on static efficiency and also on firms‘ investment and innovation decisions. Market liquidity and allowance price volatility are crucial factors in this respect. Benchmarking is, from a simple analytical finding, more conducive to a liquid market in the first years of an ET system than grandfathering. This in turn influences firms’ expectations about the future market development, including volatility. A liquid market is more conducive to all abatement approaches that are connected to investment, including to innovation. The degree of this effect depends, among other things, on the availability of non-investment abatement approaches, the nature of the price shocks and the precise risk treatment by firms.",2008-01-01,10.1007/978-0-387-73653-2_5,"['Gagelmann, Frank']",Emissions Trading,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-0-387-73653-2_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
398,Importing Environmentalism: Explaining Petroleos Mexicanos’ Cooperative Climate Policy,"Theories of environment and development tend to preemptively strip developing-country firms of environmental agency, depicting them as passive targets of market, regulatory, and ideational influences originating elsewhere. This research examines the processes by and conditions under which developing-country firms actively “import” environmental norms, programs, and practices, drawing on a case study of Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex)—one of the world’s largest oil companies and the only nationally-owned, developing-country oil company that has adopted a cooperative corporate climate policy. The article demonstrates that the company’s decision to support action on climate change resulted from efforts by climate policy entrepreneurs within Pemex’s environment division. They showed agency in choosing to prioritize the climate issue, in scanning their institutional environment for a climate policy template, in adjusting the template to suit Pemex’s particular circumstances, and in promoting the climate policy to internal and external constituencies. The research also highlights the prominent role of private sector channels in processes of environmental norm diffusion.",2007-12-01,10.1007/s12116-007-9010-8,"['Pulver, Simone']",Studies in Comparative International Development,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12116-007-9010-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

It also explores the effect of state programs on the eventual adoption of a strong national GHG mitigation policy.

400,Optimal intensity targets for greenhouse gas emissions trading under uncertainty,"Uncertainty is an obstacle for commitments under cap and trade schemes for emission permits. We assess how well intensity targets, where each country’s permit allocation is indexed to its future realized GDP, can cope with uncertainties in international greenhouse emissions trading. We present some empirical foundations for intensity targets and derive a simple rule for the optimal degree of indexation to GDP. Using an 18-region simulation model of a cooperative, global cap-and-trade treaty in 2020 under multiple uncertainties and endogenous commitments, we show that optimal intensity targets could reduce the cost of uncertainty and achieve significant increases in global abatement. The optimal degree of indexation to GDP would vary greatly between countries, including super-indexation in some advanced countries, and partial indexation for most developing countries. Standard intensity targets (with one-to-one indexation) would also improve the overall outcome, but to a lesser degree and not in all individual cases. Although target indexation is no magic wand for a future global climate treaty, gains from reduced cost uncertainty and the potential for more stringent environmental commitments could justify the increased complexity and other potential downsides of intensity targets.",2007-10-01,10.1007/s10640-006-9078-z,"['Jotzo, Frank', 'Pezzey, John C.

401,The interaction between emissions trading and renewable electricity support schemes. An overview of the literature,"The public promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources coexists in many countries with the recent implementation of emissions trading schemes. As shown by several papers, this coexistence may lead to significant interactions between both instruments, in the form of synergies and conflicts. This paper provides an overview and analysis of the literature on such coexistence and interactions. A major conclusion is that policy measures aiming at exploiting the synergies between both instruments should be implemented. The greatest synergy effects from the use of both instruments take place through appropriate coordination of their targets. Another key finding is that, although some stylised facts can be inferred from the studies, some results from those complex interactions are context-specific since they depend on the design of the instruments in particular countries. In spite of the significant policy implications of such interactions for the effective and cost-effective functioning of both instruments, this is a surprisingly under searched field.

402,Border tax adjustment: a feasible way to support stringent emission trading,"CO_2 emission allowances help to internalise effects of fossil fuel consumption on global climate and sea levels. However, consumption, production and investment decisions do not reach the optimal allocation when the scheme is only implemented in some countries. Production with inefficient facilities in non-participating countries may even increase. Border tax adjustment (BTA) for costs incurred from procuring CO_2 emission allowances reduces the leakage. We show that BTA can be both feasible and compatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) constraints.

403,Land use change and forestry climate project regional baselines: a review,"Climate change programs have largely used the project-specific approach for estimating baseline emissions of climate mitigation projects. This approach is subjective, lacks transparency, can generate inconsistent baselines for similar projects, and is likely to have high transaction costs. The use of regional baselines, which partially addresses these issues, has been reported in the literature on forestry and agriculture projects, and in greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation program guidance for them (e.g., WRI/WBCSD GHG Project Protocol, USDOE’s 1605(b) registry, UNFCCC’s Clean Development Mechanism). This paper provides an assessment of project-specific and regional baselines approaches for key baseline tasks, using project and program examples. The regional experience to date is then synthesized into generic steps that are referred to as Stratified Regional Baselines (SRB). Regional approaches generally, and SRB in particular explicitly acknowledge the heterogeneity of carbon density, land use change, and other key baseline driver variables across a landscape. SRB focuses on providing guidance on how to stratify lands into parcels with relatively homogeneous characteristics to estimate conservative baselines within a GHG assessment boundary, by applying systematic methods to determine the boundary and time period for input data.",2007-07-01,10.1007/s11027-006-9061-6,"['Sathaye, Jayant A.', 'Andrasko, Kenneth']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-006-9061-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
404,A normative ethical framework in climate change,"The article spells out four domains of international distributive justice and the consequent criteria of equity, the purpose being to identify a pluralistic normative ethical framework for climate mitigation and adaptation strategies. Justice and equity should play a major role in favouring collective action against climate change, because the more the various dimensions of such action are just, the more any international climate initiative is feasible in principle. As far as mitigation is concerned, the definition of a just initial allocation of endowments focuses on the criterion of differentiated equality, taking account of undeserved inequalities as suggested by Rawls’ theory of justice as fairness. With regard to the subsequent exchange of endowments, the Pareto principle, supplemented by the envy-freeness one, is a viable option. Possibly a sound reference for the just financing of adaptation activities is the criterion of differentiated historical responsibility, backed by Rawls’ theory of justice as fairness. As regards the allocation of adaptation resources, the criterion of lack of human security, as substantiated in Sen’s capability approach, seems promising.",2007-04-01,10.1007/s10584-006-9158-7,"['Grasso, Marco']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-006-9158-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
405,Making carbon sequestration a paying proposition,"Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO_2) has increased from a preindustrial concentration of about 280 ppm to about 367 ppm at present. The increase has closely followed the increase in CO_2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels. Global warming caused by increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is the major environmental challenge for the 21st century. Reducing worldwide emissions of CO_2 requires multiple mitigation pathways, including reductions in energy consumption, more efficient use of available energy, the application of renewable energy sources, and sequestration. Sequestration is a major tool for managing carbon emissions. In a majority of cases CO_2 is viewed as waste to be disposed; however, with advanced technology, carbon sequestration can become a value-added proposition. There are a number of potential opportunities that render sequestration economically viable. In this study, we review these most economically promising opportunities and pathways of carbon sequestration, including reforestation, best agricultural production, housing and furniture, enhanced oil recovery, coalbed methane (CBM), and CO_2 hydrates. Many of these terrestrial and geological sequestration opportunities are expected to provide a direct economic benefit over that obtained by merely reducing the atmospheric CO_2 loading. Sequestration opportunities in 11 states of the Southeast and South Central United States are discussed. Among the most promising methods for the region include reforestation and CBM. The annual forest carbon sink in this region is estimated to be 76 Tg C/year, which would amount to an expenditure of $11.1–13.9 billion/year. Best management practices could enhance carbon sequestration by 53.9 Tg C/year, accounting for 9.3% of current total annual regional greenhouse gas emission in the next 20 years. Annual carbon storage in housing, furniture, and other wood products in 1998 was estimated to be 13.9 Tg C in the region. Other sequestration options, including the direct injection of CO_2 in deep saline aquifers, mineralization, and biomineralization, are not expected to lead to direct economic gain. More detailed studies are needed for assessing the ultimate changes to the environment and the associated indirect cost savings for carbon sequestration.",2007-03-01,10.1007/s00114-006-0170-6,"['Han, Fengxiang X.', 'Lindner, Jeff S.', 'Wang, Chuji']",Naturwissenschaften,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00114-006-0170-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

Once a theoretical option discussed only by economists, emissions trading is now considered a mainstream policy instrument in the United States with bipartisan political support.

407,Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from land use: creating	incentives within greenhouse gas emissions trading systems,"Terrestrial carbon sinks and sources were introduced into climate change mitigation related policy relatively late in the design of the architecture of those policies. Much literature addresses how terrestrial sources and sinks differ from emissions from fossil fuel combustion and, hence, is a possible justification for differential treatment of them in policy design. Late introduction in climate policy discussions and perceived differences appear to have resulted in very different policy approaches for sinks versus fossil emission sources. The attempt to differentiate has generated complexity in policy design and likely inefficiency in the operation of these policies. We review these issues and find that the characteristics claimed to apply to sinks apply as well to fossil sources, and differences that do exist are often more a matter of degree than of kind. Because cap-and-trade has gained momentum as the instrument of choice to control fossil emissions, we use as a starting point, how such a cap-and-trade system could be altered to include terrestrial carbon sinks and sources.",2007-01-01,10.1007/s10584-006-9151-1,"['Reilly, John M.', 'Asadoorian, Malcolm O.']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-006-9151-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

409,Norway and Emissions Trading: From Global Front-Runner to EU Follower,"A striking convergence has taken place in the design of the Norwegian and EU greenhouse gas emissions trading systems from 1998 to 2004. This article argues that the Norwegian adaptation to the EU did not take place as a consequence of perceived legal obligations under the European Economic Area agreement. Nor did it take place due to Norwegian actors being persuaded about the merits of the EU design. The main explanation has to do with interests. The EU market and politics are of course generally very important for Norway. However, before the US pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, the Norwegian outlook in climate politics was global. The US pull-out accelerated the development and hence the attractiveness of the EU trading system and resulted in EU emissions trading as the most probable and possibly only international market for Norway to link up to. Hence, this analysis provides further support to the importance of being sensitive to the global context and institutional interaction when analyzing the relationship between the EU and its neighboring countries.",2006-03-01,10.1007/s10784-005-5095-6,"['Sæverud, Ingvild Andreassen', 'Wettestad, Jørgen']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-005-5095-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

411,Global Environment Threats and a Divided Northern Community,"The EU, Japan, and the US now share many environmental norms, laws, and institutions and cooperate on international environmental matters through numerous bilateral and multilateral channels. They disagree, however, on how to deal with some of the most serious issues facing the global environment and the quality of human life including wide-scale biodiversity loss, climate change, the use of genetically modified (GM) organisms; the trans-boundary movement of hazardous wastes, and chemical safety. As these are all issues that require the involvement of developing countries if global environmental protection efforts are to be effective, the discord that exists among the Northern states is of tremendous significance. The US has pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol arguing that the treaty is poorly designed and would be detrimental to the US economy. Japan and the EU have had to try to find a way to bring the treaty into force without the participation of the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases and to convince participating countries to meet their targets even though this may put them at a competitive disadvantage. In the case of biodiversity loss, although the US initiated international negotiations on biodiversity preservation, it has refused to join the EU and Japan in ratifying the Convention on Biological Diversity. There are also differences between the US, on the one side, and Japan and the EU on the other, regarding the use of GM organisms.

412,Enforcing Emissions Trading when Emissions Permits are Bankable,"We propose enforcement strategies for emissions trading programs with bankable emissions permits that guarantee complete compliance with minimal enforcement costs. Our strategies emphasize imperfect monitoring supported by a high unit penalty for reporting violations, and tying this penalty directly to equilibrium permit prices. This approach is quite different from several existing enforcement strategies that emphasize high unit penalties for emissions in excess of permit holdings. Our analysis suggests that a high penalty for excess emissions cannot be used to conserve monitoring effort, and that it may actually increase the amount of monitoring necessary to maintain compliance.",2005-09-01,10.1007/s11149-005-3108-6,"['Stranlund, John K.', 'Costello, Christopher', 'Chávez, Carlos A.']",Journal of Regulatory Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11149-005-3108-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
413,"Taxes, Tradable Rights and Transaction Costs","With respect to market-based policy approaches, it is a widely held view that corrective taxation entails substantial, though far fewer transaction costs than tradable permit systems. This conclusion only holds if set-up costs are singled out. This paper explores all relevant market, managerial and political transaction costs associated with environmental taxes and tradable emission rights. It is argued that the prevalence of transaction costs is largely dependent on the design of the policy instrument, respectively the tax base or the trading regime chosen. Comparative analysis further shows that a cap-and-trade program of emission permits distributed for free, traded on a brokered market and monitored upstream is not only more effective, but also likely to entail fewer transaction costs than environmental taxes. Any attempt, in turn, to save the huge information, enforcement and compliance costs incurred by corrective taxation impairs its efficacy by severing the link between the environmental externality and the tax base.",2005-09-01,10.1007/s10657-005-1737-y,"['Crals, Evy', 'Vereeck, Lode']",European Journal of Law and Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10657-005-1737-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
414,Trade Measures and Climate Compliance: Institutional Interplay Between WTO and the Marrakesh Accords,"This article examines the potential of trade measures to induce more climate-friendly policies, focusing on the relationship between global trade rules and the Kyoto climate regime. At the core of this interplay is the normative consistency of trade-related rules in the two regimes and any hierarchical relationship between them. The stronger clout of the WTO and its compulsory dispute settlement system suggest that issues involving competing claims would be referred to WTO bodies. Such bodies have so far been restrictive regarding the exceptions in WTO agreements to the general ban on embargoes and discrimination. The normative compatibility of the two regimes will also depend on their participatory interplay, specifically how they differentiate groups of actors as to rights and obligations. Non-members of WTO receive the least protection, and their vulnerability to climate-related trade measures is largely determined by their interdependence with states that consider employment of such measures. Among WTO members, the findings of a dispute settlement body would presumably differ depending on the status of the target under the Kyoto Protocol. A non-complier with Kyoto commitments would be more shielded than a non-party, because by joining the Kyoto regime a non-complier has exposed itself to regime-internal and less trade intrusive measures that should be exhausted first. A third dimension of interplay is linkage , or efforts to influence the regime interplay.

First, the simulations indicatethat no matter how permits are allocated,this policy instrument can substantiallyreduce the cost of GHG mitigation for theU.S. in comparison to a system of fixedquotas for each of its regions.

417,Sectoral Opposition to Carbon Taxes in the EU – a Myopic Economic Approach,"Over 10 years ago the EU Commission proposed a directive on carbon taxes, but faced so much domestic resistance that agreement was not reached until last year – and after it had been considerably watered down. The aim of this paper is to look into economic reasons for the political infeasibility of extensive carbon taxes. Since opposition is believed to arise prior to the policy implementation, the cost estimates have a myopic character compared with market estimates, in the sense that sectors are presumed to take into account their own substitution opportunities, but disregard changes in other sectors as well as the macroeconomic welfare gains from a tax regime. With this myopic approach, we estimate and compare costs of emissions cuts across sectors and across countries in the EU, showing how different sectors might have anticipated the impacts from an expected carbon tax. This focus illustrates that what seems to be cost-effective and to the best for the region on paper turned out too controversial to be politically feasible.",2004-09-01,10.1007/s10784-004-1156-5,"['Froyn, Camilla Bretteville', 'Aaheim, H.

Trade-Based Carbon Sequestration Accounting
","This article describes and illustrates an accounting method to assess and compare “early” carbon sequestration investments and trades on the basis of the number of standardized CO_2 emission offset credits they will provide. The “gold standard” for such credits is assumed to be a relatively riskless credit based on a CO_2 emission reduction that provides offsets against CO_2 emissions on a one-for-one basis. The number of credits associated with carbon sequestration needs to account for time, risk, durability, permanence, additionality, and other factors that future trade regulators will most certainly use to assign “official” credits to sequestration projects. The method that is presented here uses established principles of natural resource accounting and conventional rules of asset valuation to “score” projects. A review of 20 “early” voluntary United States based CO_2 offset trades that involve carbon sequestration reveals that the assumptions that buyers, sellers, brokers, and traders are using to characterize the economic potential of their investments and trades vary enormously. The article develops a “universal carbon sequestration credit scoring equation” and uses two of these trades to illustrate the sensitivity of trade outcomes to various assumptions about how future trade auditors are likely to “score” carbon sequestration projects in terms of their “equivalency” with CO_2 emission reductions. The article emphasizes the importance of using a standard credit scoring method that accounts for time and risk to assess and compare even unofficial prototype carbon sequestration trades. The scoring method illustrated in this article is a tool that can protect the integrity of carbon sequestration credit trading and can assist buyers and sellers in evaluating the real economic potential of prospective trades.",2004-08-01,10.1007/s00267-003-9112-7,"['King, Dennis M.']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-003-9112-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
419,Policy Integration as a Success Factor for Emissions Trading,"Emissions trading will not be able to become the single instrument of a national climate policy because of costs for monitoring of greenhouse gases and transfers of allowances. Thus, it is important to assess optimal ways of integrating emissions trading into national climate policy mixes, thus leading to a more efficient policy, especially by allowing the use of transboundary transactions. The implemented trading systems of the UK and Denmark, the agreed EU one, and the planned ones of Norway are used as case studies. In the UK, the introduction of an energy tax on industry was the catalyst that led to the development of emissions trading, voluntary agreements, and two subsidy programs. However, in Denmark trading was limited in scope and not integrated with the successful emission tax. The EU and Norwegian trading schemes both have a large scope and integrate international transfers; the former is integrated with other instruments to avoid free riding. Policy integration will thus enhance the efficiency improvements that emissions trading can introduce.",2004-06-01,10.1007/s00267-004-3071-5,"['Michaelowa, Axel']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-004-3071-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

The flexible mechanisms defined within the Kyoto Protocol are designed to achieve cost-effectiveness of emissions reduction by allowing countries to reduce emissions abroad, either in other Annex B countries, or in non Annex B countries. However, in determining the split of reduction measures between abroad and at home, transaction cost and risk elements that might be associated with the operation of these instruments are not usually taken into account.

423,Can the Czech Republic Participate in Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading?,"The aim of this case study is to answer the question whether in the next decade and longer term the Czech Republic can participate in greenhouse gas emission trading. We analysed the position of the Czech Republic, especially with respect to one of the most discussed international agreements in this field, the Kyoto Protocol. Carbon, which is considered here primarily as the main source of energy so that it can be discussed later as the main component of greenhouse gases, is the main ""binding material"" of all the parts of the presented paper. The study starts with the current economic and environmental situation in the Czech Republic in its first chapter. The second part focuses on the energy sector – the main source of greenhouse gas emissions – from the point of view of fossil energy sources as well as renewable energy sources. The third chapter offers a comprehensive national greenhouse gas inventory which allows us in the following chapter to make some predictions about the Czech Republic's potential for intangible carbon flows – emission permits trading. This chapter contains projections not only for the Kyoto Protocol term (2008–2012) but also for medium (2020) and longer terms (2030). Besides the emission projections the description of possible future developments in government strategy, with respect to emission trading, has been outlined in this section. Through such a procedure the main research question, whether the Czech Republic can participate in greenhouse gas emission trading in the next decade, is answered in the affirmative for the period 2008–2012 and the potential for joint implementation and emission trading is quantified. At the end of this study we also raised some broader research questions about problems connected with the future development of an emission trading system after 2012.",2003-09-01,10.1023/B:INEA.0000005627.39111.e9,"['Sejak, Josef', 'Kupka, Martin']",International Environmental Agreements,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/B:INEA.0000005627.39111.e9,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
424,"Climate Change Policies, Energy Security and Carbon Dependency Trade-offs for the European Union in the Longer Term
","Energy policy in the European Union (EU) faces two major challenges. The first challenge is posed by EUs commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere in the context of the international agreement on climate change. The second challenge is to keep ensuring European security of energy supply, while its dependency on external sources of energy is projected to increase. In this paper, two long-term alternative climate change policy scenarios for Europe are examined. In the first scenario, EU reduces carbon dioxide emissions by domestic measures; in the second scenario EU maximizes cooperation with the countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU). Impacts on carbon flows between the EU and FSU and on the external energy dependency of the EU are assessed with an applied general equilibrium model, GTAP-E, whose set of energy commodities is expanded with combustible biomass as a renewable and carbon-neutral energy commodity. The results show that there is a trade-off between economic efficiency, energy security and carbon dependency for the EU.

425,Assessing the Impact of Carbon Tax Differentiation in the European Union,"To what extent do the welfare costs associated with the implementation of the Burden Sharing Agreement in the European Union depend on sectoral allocation of emissions rights? What are the prospects for strategic climate policy to favor domestic production? This paper attempts to answer those questions using a CGE model featuring a detailed representation of the European economies. First, numerical simulations show that equalizing marginal abatement costs across domestic sectors greatly reduces the burden of the emissions constraint but also that other allocations may be preferable for some countries because of pre-existing tax distortions. Second, we show that the effect of a single country's attempt to undertake a strategic policy to limit impacts on its domestic energy-intensive industries has mixed effects. Exempting energy-intensive industries from the reduction program is a costly solution to maintain the international competitiveness of these industries; a tax-cum-subsidy approach is shown to be better than exemption policy to sustain exports. The welfare impact either policy – exemption or subsidy – on other European countries is likely to be small because of general equilibrium effects.",2003-09-01,10.1023/A:1025543207122,"['Babiker, Mustafa H.', 'Criqui, Patrick', 'Ellerman, A.

Within the framework of a modestly simple,integrated assessment model that breaks the world economy in just two regions,North and South,it can be shown: (1) There exists separability between environmental targets and the choice of instruments. Increasing the “when and where” flexibility in greenhouse gas abatement either through banking or trading of carbon emission permits or both positively affects global welfare. It has,however,almost no impact on global climate change. (2) Depending upon the choice of instruments there are significant distributional effects across regions. Both regions can improve welfare simultaneously,if carbon emission rights are traded on open international markets. But if it were feasible to bank or borrow carbon permits,then — independent of whether there is trading of carbon rights or not — the South suffers welfare losses compared to a No-Trade-No-Banking situation.",2003-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-57415-3_9,"['Stephan, Gunter', 'Müller-Fürstenberger, Georg']",Empirical Modeling of the Economy and the Environment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-57415-3_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

The results show that the US withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol leads to no real emission reduction in all remaining Annex 1 regions. The results also indicate that the overall compliance costs of all remaining Annex 1 regions in the case of the former Soviet Union (FSU) cooperating with the Eastern European countries could reach as much as two times that in the case of only FSU acting as a monopoly. Moreover, curtailing permit supply by market power substantially increases the overall environmental effectiveness, although to much less extent than in the case of the US ratification.

431,International institutions and the framing of domestic policies: The Kyoto Protocol and Canada's response to climate change,"The 1997 Kyoto Protocol establishes an international institutional framework for domestic responses to climate change that links emission targets for developed countries to international market mechanisms. Although these ‘flexible mechanisms’ allow developed countries some leeway in how they meet their commitments to reduce greenhouse gases, the protocol also establishes a normative framework that directs domestic policy responses along certain paths. Applying insights from sociological institutionalism and constructivism in international relations, this article argues first, that the climate change regime reflects and further institutionalizes the prevailing international normative structure in the environmental issue area, characterized as ‘liberal environmentalism.’ Second, these norms, as embodied in the climate change regime, have enabled and constrained climate change policy development in Canada, one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases per capita. International norms can shape or redefine domestic interests, enable policies in conformity with those norms, and create normative pressures for change by linking with extant domestic and foreign policy norms. Uncovering this international institutional-domestic policy interaction resolves the paradox of Canada's promotion of commitments and mechanisms consistent with its domestic interests and institutional constraints, but eventual commitment to action well beyond what those constraints dictate. This commitment continues despite Kyoto's uncertain future. The findings also point to lacunae in the literature on regime compliance and effectiveness more broadly, especially its dominant rationalist variant.",2002-06-01,10.1023/A:1016158505323,"['Bernstein, Steven']",Policy Sciences,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1016158505323,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
432,Carbon Emissions Trading and Equity in International Agreements,"This paper explores the distributional consequences of alternative emissions trading schemes. It is argued that the distributional impact stems from the difference between two social welfare functions: the function which is implicitly maximised in a competitive market equilibrium and the function which is implicitly adopted when a given equity principle is chosen. An integrated assessment model is used to illustrate these findings, by simulating the introduction of various emissions trading schemes for the Kyoto protocol on the reduction of greenhouse emissions. It is shown that (1) changes produced on an equity index by the imposition of emission constraints (by country) may not be significantly higher than those obtained by the subsequent introduction of a market mechanism, and that (2) the various market regimes which could be adopted have quite different distributional implications.",2002-04-01,10.1023/A:1015218031905,"['Bosello, Francesco', 'Roson, Roberto']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1015218031905,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
433,Emission Trading Restrictions with Endogenous Technological Change,"In this paper we use a simple climate model for endogenous environmental technical change in order to analyse the effects on equity and efficiency of placing different degrees of restrictions on trade in the market of pollution permits. The model is obtained by incorporating in Nordhaus and Yang (1996)'s RICE model a notion of induced technical change close to the one proposed in Goulder and Mathai (2000). With the help of such a model, we assess the pros and cons of introducing ceilings on emission trading. In particular, we analyse both the cost effectiveness and the distributional effects of placing restrictions of trading emissions. The analysis takes into account the role of environmental technical change that could be enhanced by emission trade limitations. However, this effect is shown to be offset by the increased abatement cost induced by the larger than optimal adoption of domestic policy measures when ceilings are made binding. Hence, our analysis provides little support for quantitative restrictions of emission trading, even when these restrictions actually have a positive impact of technical change. Even in terms of equity, ceilings find no justification within our theoretical and modelling framework. Indeed, we find that flexibility mechanisms in the presence of endogenous technical change increase equity and that the highest equity levels are achieved without ceilings, both in the short and in the long run.",2001-07-01,10.1023/A:1011594622427,"['Buonanno, Paolo', 'Carraro, Carlo', 'Castelnuovo, Efrem', 'Galeotti, Marzio']",International Environmental Agreements,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1011594622427,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
434,Project-Based Emissions Trading: The Impact of Institutional Arrangements on Cost-Effectiveness,"In this paper we demonstrate that the institutionalarrangement (or: design) of Joint Implementation (JI) and the CleanDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) has a decisive impact on theircost-effectiveness. We illustrate our arguments by statistically analyzing thecosts from 94 Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) pilot phase projects aswell as by adjusting these data on the basis of simple mathematicalformulas. These calculations explicitly take into account the institutionaldifferences between JI (sinks, no banking) and the CDM (banking, no sinks)under the Kyoto Protocol and also show the possible effects on credit costsof alternative design options. However, our numerical illustrations shouldbe viewed with caution, because AIJ is only to a limited extentrepresentative of potential future JI and CDM projects and because creditcosts are not credit prices. Some of the main figures found in this study are:an average cost figure per unit of emission reduction for AIJ projects of 46dollar per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent ($/Mg CO_2-eq), anaverage potential JI credit cost figure which is lowered to 37$/Mg CO_2-eq by introducing banking and an average of 6$/Mg CO_2-eq per credit for potential low-cost CDM projects whichincludes sinks. However, at CoP6 in November 2000 in The Hague (TheNetherlands), the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change(FCCC) did not (yet) reach consensus on the institutional details of theproject-based mechanisms, such as the possible arrangement of early JIaction or the inclusion of sinks under the CDM.",2001-06-01,10.1023/A:1011330609725,"['Woerdman, Edwin', 'van der Gaast, Wytze']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1011330609725,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

It starts with a discussion of the EU Burden Sharing Agreement, which distributes the target between Member States. This leads to a review of the appropriate level of implementation of policies, i.e. at the EU level or Member State level. There is a role for the flexible mechanisms of the Protocol, particularly emission permit trading, in complementing Member State policies at the EU level. The implementation is to be done against the background of three major factors which may have an important bearing on the policies: • the probable long-term requirement of substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions • a changing structure of energy markets, following liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets • EU enlargement to include economies in transition with the potential for further substantial reductions in emissions. The paper concludes with a discussion of ancillary benefits of the policies that may be substantial and a summary of the position as regards the ""unfinished business"" of the Protocol to be discussed at the Conference of the Parties in the Hague in November 2000.",2001-04-01,10.1023/A:1010133423451,"['Barker, Terry', 'Kram, Tom', 'Oberthür, Sebastian', 'Voogt, Monique']",International Environmental Agreements,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1010133423451,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

439,Efficiency and Equity of Emissions Trading with Endogenous Environmental Technical Change,"In recent years, particularly the last one, there have been many attempts to quantify the costs of implementing the Kyoto agreement under different policy options, i.e. with or without different degrees of introduction of the so-called ‘flexibility mechanisms’ (Emissions Trading, Joint Implementation, Clean Development Mechanisms).^1 Despite the high variability, all estimates show that the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms significantly reduce the costs of compliance. Shogren (1999) notes that ‘it is estimated that any agreement without the cost flexibility provided by trading will at least double the US costs, ... the key is to distribute emissions internationally so as to minimise the costs of climate policy’. Manne and Richels (1999) state that ‘losses in 2010 are two and one-half times higher with the constraint on the purchase of carbon emissions rights; international co-operation through trade is essential if we are to reduce mitigation costs’. These are just two examples of the many studies reaching the same conclusion: emissions trading, and more generally flexibility mechanisms, can achieve a reduction in overall mitigation costs without reducing the effectiveness of the climate policy (see also Rose and Stevens, 1999; Bosello and Roson, 1999; Hourcade, Ha-Duong, and Lecocq, 1999; Tol, 1999).

440,Competitiveness of biomass‐fueled electrical power plants,"One way countries like the United States can comply with suggested rollbacks in greenhouse gas emissions is by employing power plants fueled with biomass. We examine the competitiveness of biomass‐based fuel for electrical power as opposed to coal using a mathematical programming structure.

441,Negotiated Agreements and ‘Flexible Mechanisms’: Building Blocks for Efficient Kyoto Implementation Strategies in the European Union?,"In December 1997 international climate protection efforts culminated with the historic accord reached at Kyoto. In the Protocol, named after the Japanese city Kyoto hosting the Third Conference of the Parties to the Climate Convention, 38 industrialized and transition countries plus the European Community have committed to limit or reduce emissions of a set of six greenhouse gases^2 (GHG). The European Community and its Member States have the obligation to reduce GHG emissions by 8% in the target period 2008 to 2012 compared to the emissions level in 1990, the overall reduction of all committed countries amounts to above 5%.",2000-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-57691-1_10,"['Zapfel, Peter']",Flexible Mechanisms for an Efficient Climate Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-57691-1_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
442,"Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting, Verification, and Certification of Climate Change Mitigation Projects","Monitoring and evaluation of climate change mitigation projects is needed to accurately determine the net greenhouse gas (GHG), and other, benefits and costs, and to ensure that the global climate is protected and that country obligations are met. One of the objectives of this chapter is to examine the Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) Pilot experience in monitoring and evaluation, in order to assist the development of modalities for monitoring, evaluation, reporting, verification, and certification (MERVC) for Clean Development Mechanisms (CDM) and joint implementation (JI) projects. Another objective of this chapter is to provide guidance on how one should go about monitoring, evaluating, reporting, verifying, and certifying climate change mitigation projects based on a review of the literature and our previous work on developing MERVC guidelines for energy-efficiency and land-use change and forestry (LUCF) projects. The five-year AIJ Pilot is still in its early stages (most projects were started in 1997–98) and offers little insight into the experience of monitoring and evaluation so far. Evaluation of some of these projects is starting to improve our understanding of key MERVC issues, and we anticipate more evaluations of these projects in the near future. Nevertheless, we agree with the findings of the second synthesis study on the AIJ Pilot that concluded that work needed to be conducted on methodological, technical and institutional issues, including modalities for measurement, reporting and assessment. We also agree with the findings from a recent OECD study on emission baselines for AIJ projects which concluded that simple reporting measures were needed for improving the transparency and comparability of different projects (for AIJ, JI and CDM projects), including project-specific emission baselines. Some MERVC issues have been examined in the AIJ pilot, but future investments are needed to refine methods and protocols in support of the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms. Some progress has been made in the development of guidance documents for the MERVC of energy-efficiency and forestry projects, but more work needs to be done for developing internationally agreed MERVC guidelines: e.g., evaluation of additionality, free riders, project leakage, positive project spillover, market transformation, environmental impacts, and socioeconomic impacts. A community of MERVC evaluators and verifiers has been developed in response to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) AIJ pilot, and these individuals and organizations are involved in working on the details of implementing the modalities for measurement, reporting and assessment. Institutional and human capacity building is sorely needed to implement future CDM and JI projects, as well as emissions trading regimes.",1999-01-01,10.1007/978-94-011-4287-8_13,"['Vine, Edward', 'Sathaye, Jayant', 'Makundi, Willy', 'Jones, Jed']",The U.N.

443,Agency in International Pollution Permit Trading,"This chapter investigates institutional issues affecting the potential design of an international pollution permit trading program. Most previous studies, including simulation models of SO_2 emissions trading in Europe, have assumed that national governments would be the agents participating in trades. An alternative is that emission permits be distributed to and traded by affected enterprises. This chapter evaluates these two alternatives according to the two primary benefits usually attributed to incentive-based environmental policies. The first is the attainment of cost effectiveness, also referred to as technical or productive efficiency. The second is the internalization of social costs, otherwise known as allocative efficiency. I conclude that an international system of emission permit trading such as SO_2 trading in Europe, would perform better according to these economic criteria if permits were distributed directly to affected enterprises. However, in this brief investigation, such a conclusion can not be definitive. Rather, the primary finding is that further attention to the question of agency is warranted. Nevertheless, a strong case can be made that international environmental agreements such as an accord for SO_2 emissions trading in Europe should establish guidelines for national governments regarding the domestic economic regulation of internationally tradable permits.",1994-01-01,10.1007/978-94-011-1012-9_12,"['Burtraw, Dallas']",Economic Instruments for Air Pollution Control,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-011-1012-9_12,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer
444,Making Carbon Emission Quota Agreements More Efficient: Joint Implementation versus Quota Tradability,"Given that a set of countries agree to keep their carbon emissions within certain national quota limits, the outcome would be a treaty in the tradition of the Rio Convention, only one step more demanding. This chapter discusses two additional measures to improve the efficiency properties of such a nontradable quota treaty. Both measures would allow committed countries to buy emission reductions from other countries as a way of partially fulfilling their commitments. One is “joint implementation”, which was supported by the Convention as an instrument capable of increasing the efficiency of commitments to limit carbon emissions. It is questioned here whether joint implementation between developed and developing countries would imply a considerable increase in efficiency. The other measure is to make national emission quotas tradable, which, in contrast, could significantly improve efficiency (to the extent that trade does), especially if developing countries with low abatement costs could be induced to participate. Here, we identify the circumstances under which quota tradability would allow developing countries to participate without subjecting them to risks of economic losses.",1994-01-01,10.1007/978-94-011-1012-9_9,"['Bohm, Peter']",Economic Instruments for Air Pollution Control,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-011-1012-9_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions trade"")",springer

After keeping the faith solely in economic growth for so many decades, it is hard to believe that China’s elite group can make a fast transition. However, resent reports on renewable surge in China may well illustrate the country’s determination on this account. The atrocious state of environment, as well as the concerns of energy security and economic development in the medium and longer run has prompted Chinese policy makers to carry out an energy revolution.

447,Rainmakers,"Beijing had a smog problem. Billions had been spent to reduce pollution, with limited to no success. Factories had been shut or shifted out of town. Special scrubbers were made mandatory for power plants, and electric heaters were installed to replace coal in ancient courtyard homes. Saplings were planted and parking lots were paved. Yet, incessant construction and rapid growth in automobile numbers added to the problem. A year to the day before the start of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, the president of the International Olympic Committee suggested that a few of the endurance events might need to be postponed (BBC Sport 2007). A fortnight before the inauguration of the games, the government forced over a million cars off the streets, suspended construction activity, and halted work at several hundred factories in surrounding provinces. Artificial rainmaking through cloud seeding was seen as a “natural” way to clean the air (AP 2007). Cars bearing odd-numbered license plates were required to drive on odd-numbered dates and those with even-numbered plates on even dates. Further, cars that shared the same last number of the license plate with the date were to stay away for the day (Spencer 2008). The antipollution measures disrupted workday commutes for residents and caused thousands of others to take time off work, involuntarily, and with cut-rate wages. Many of the restrictions were extended to neighboring cities and provinces. Domestic retailers found it difficult to replenish inventory. Exports were hit. Consumers in China’s export markets suffered too. The air quality was also expected to adversely affect athletes’ performance, especially those with asthma or other respiratory problems. Beijing remained wrapped in a gray haze. “When we grew up pollution wasn’t a problem, because we didn’t have all this industry,” observed steel trader Zang (Oster 2008).",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-81-322-0882-2_1,"['Sunderasan, Srinivasan']",Enabling Environment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-81-322-0882-2_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions market"")",springer

449,Nutrients in the nexus,"Synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer has enabled modern agriculture to greatly improve human nutrition during the twentieth century, but it has also created unintended human health and environmental pollution challenges for the twenty-first century. Averaged globally, about half of the fertilizer-N applied to farms is removed with the crops, while the other half remains in the soil or is lost from farmers’ fields, resulting in water and air pollution. As human population continues to grow and food security improves in the developing world, the dual development goals of producing more nutritious food with low pollution will require both technological and socio-economic innovations in agriculture. Two case studies presented here, one in sub-Saharan Africa and the other in Midwestern United States, demonstrate how management of nutrients, water, and energy is inextricably linked in both small-scale and large-scale food production, and that science-based solutions to improve the efficiency of nutrient use can optimize food production while minimizing pollution. To achieve the needed large increases in nutrient use efficiency, however, technological developments must be accompanied by policies that recognize the complex economic and social factors affecting farmer decision-making and national policy priorities. Farmers need access to affordable nutrient supplies and support information, and the costs of improving efficiencies and avoiding pollution may need to be shared by society through innovative policies. Success will require interdisciplinary partnerships across public and private sectors, including farmers, private sector crop advisors, commodity supply chains, government agencies, university research and extension, and consumers.",2016-03-01,10.1007/s13412-016-0364-y,"['Davidson, Eric A.', 'Nifong, Rachel L.', 'Ferguson, Richard B.', 'Palm, Cheryl', 'Osmond, Deanna L.', 'Baron, Jill S.']",Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13412-016-0364-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas market trade"")",springer
450,A Proposal to Adjust the Time-Keeping Systems for Savings in Cycling Operation and Carbon Emission,"With the spread of the power transmission networks to thousands of kilometres, the integrated power grid in many countries cover multiple hours in terms of solar position. We present a general mathematical model with multiple time-keeping systems for flattening the electrical load curve in a territory having integrated power grid operations. The multiple time-keeping system areas are set up as a function of both electrical power demand and mean geographical position in longitude. Fluctuation in load results in cycling operation of coal/gas power plants and enhanced carbon emission. In this paper, an attempt is made to quantify the savings in cycling of electrical power plant operation and the associated carbon emission with adjustment of time-keeping systems. For the territory of India, the reduction in cycling operation of power plants by 9% of peak demand is demonstrated.",2019-12-01,10.1007/s40031-019-00419-7,"['Chakrabarti, Amlan', 'Chakrabarty, Krishnendu']",Journal of The Institution of Engineers (India): Series B,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40031-019-00419-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit trade"")",springer

452,Review of Indian Low Carbon Scenarios,"An increase in global temperatures at rapid rate is attributed to greenhouse gas emissions mainly from our energy system. This paper performs a comparison and meta-analysis of low carbon scenarios based on integrated assessment models to provide insights on India’s greenhouse gas mitigation potential. This review compares the range of scenario formulation methods, analytical models, energy demand estimation methods, baseline scenarios, mitigation drivers, and low carbon scenario assumptions. A meta-analysis was conducted to provide insights on findings from these scenarios by analyzing trends in energy mix, electricity production, and emissions for 2050. The analysis of mitigation scenarios shows a clear decline in energy and carbon intensity for year 2050. The studies use a range of policies and targets for analyzing mitigation potential for India. This paper highlights trends in past studies where earlier studies have used parametric changes to create energy scenarios while recent studies have also used structural changes and policy options. The policy scenarios suggest a reduction in energy intensity by 70% with emission intensity declining by more than 90% by 2050. The emissions in policy scenarios stabilize in the range of 1300–2600 million tonne CO_2 by 2050 averaged at 2118 million tonnes. The policy scenarios also suggest a phaseout of coal and its substitution with gas combined with carbon capture, nuclear, and solar.

456,Investigating the link between carbon dioxide emissions and transport-related social exclusion in rural Northern Ireland,"Carbon dioxide (CO_2) is considered the most harmful of the greenhouse gases. Despite policy efforts, transport is the only sector experiencing an increase in the level of CO_2 emissions and thereby possesses a major threat to sustainable development. In contrast, a reduced level of mobility has been associated with an increasing risk of being socially excluded. However, despite being the two key elements in transport policy, little effort has so far been made to investigate the links between CO_2 emissions and social exclusion. This research contributes to this gap by analysing data from 157 weekly activity-travel diaries collected in rural Northern Ireland. CO_2 emission levels were calculated using average speed models for different modes of transport. Regression analyses were then conducted to identify the socio-spatial patterns associated with these CO_2 emissions, mode choice behaviour, and patterns of participation in activities. This research found that despite emitting a higher level of CO_2, groups in rural areas possess the risk of being socially excluded due to their higher levels of mobility.",2015-11-01,10.1007/s13762-015-0771-8,"['Kamruzzaman, M.', 'Hine, J.', 'Yigitcanlar, T.']",International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13762-015-0771-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit trade"")",springer

Two promising regulatory policy settings are considered: namely, (a) a carbon cap and trade system, or (b) a tax on the amount of carbon emissions. A traditional CLSC network design model using stochastic programming is extended to integrate robust optimization to account for regulations of the carbon emissions caused by transportation. We propose a hybrid model to account for both regulatory policies and derive tractable robust counterparts under box and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets. Implications for network configuration, product allocation and transportation configuration are obtained via a detailed case study. We also present computational results that illustrate how the problem formulation under an ellipsoidal uncertainty set allows the decision maker to balance the trade-off between robustness and performance.

458,Development and Application of Economic and Environmental Models of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agriculture: Some Difficult Choices for Policy Makers,"This chapter describes how economic models designed to examine agricultural policy can be adapted to explore environmental applications such as the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture to a 2050 time horizon. The tensions between environmental policy aimed at reducing GHG emissions, and policies promoting agricultural production to increase food security are explored. Ireland is a major net exporter of beef and milk products, with agriculture representing a high share of non-Emissions Trading Scheme (non-ETS) GHG emissions. Ireland is used to illustrate an issue which has wide-scale global implications. The feasibility of achieving emission reductions is examined in the absence of technical abatement measures. Instead, to reduce emissions the size of the suckler herd is limited. However, it is found that even eliminating the suckler herd would leave emissions well short of achieving a 20 % reduction target. Even a 10 % GHG emissions reduction, while possible under this approach, is likely to be politically unfeasible. The tension between environmental and food security is likely to be replicated at a global level, given the significant contribution of agricultural production to anthropogenic climate change. The chapter highlights the importance of detailed modelling of future emissions in advance of setting feasible emissions reduction targets.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-06635-6_13,"['Donnellan, Trevor', 'Hanrahan, Kevin', 'Breen, James P.']",Agricultural Cooperative Management and Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-06635-6_13,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit trade"")",springer
459,Managing the Bargaining Table Through Flexibility Mechanisms: The Benefits of Coalitions and Sequencing,"Progress in global climate change negotiations is inhibited by complicated and diffuse conflict between paradigms (expressed through norms and institutions), and self-enforcing dynamic processes. Paradigms that aim to maintain structure in the relations between actors become subjects for modifications or replacement as dynamic processes unfold, leading to tensions when negotiating decisions. As this research project argues, managing bargaining during global climate talks is conditioned by strategies to make static paradigms and dynamic processes mutually tolerable when not compatible, particularly because both paradigms and dynamic processes contribute to the robust stability of the system. Both the ability to adapt to new dynamics and the capacity to reduce contingencies through norms and institutions constantly exposes actors to complex learning processes when making decisions. Negotiators, frustrated with tedious and time-consuming decision-making—for example during single negotiation rounds—seek both general and mini-agreements, including framework agreements, and implement plans that intend to provide structures to the social relations and frameworks of future decisions. Nevertheless, by the time decisions are made, new political dynamics often arise that challenge reached outcomes, forcing the negotiation process to start anew and increasing frustration during negotiation.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-06197-9_9,"['Hernández, Ariel Macaspac']",Strategic Facilitation of Complex Decision-Making,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-06197-9_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit trade"")",springer

We use the WITCH energy-economy-climate model to investigate the long term prospects of DAC, implementing a technological specification based on recent estimates by the American Physical Society (APS 2011 ). Assuming global cooperation on a stringent climate policy we find that: (1) DAC is deployed only late in century, after other low carbon options, though at a very significant scale; (2) DAC has an impact on the marginal and total abatement costs (reducing them) and on the timing of mitigation (postponing it); (3) DAC also allows for a prolonged use of oil, with a positive welfare impact for energy exporting countries. Finally, we assess the role of DAC in a less than ideal climate policy by exploring its potential for engaging energy exporting countries in climate mitigation activities by means of a “clean oil” market in which oil exporters can sell oil decarbonized via DAC.",2013-05-01,10.1007/s10584-013-0714-7,"['Chen, Chen', 'Tavoni, Massimo']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-013-0714-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit trade"")",springer

462,Mitigating methane emissions from livestock: a global analysis of sectoral policies,"Methane emissions from livestock enteric fermentation and manure management represent about 40% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector and are projected to increase substantially in the coming decades, with most of the growth occurring in non-Annex 1 countries. To mitigate livestock methane, incentive policies based on producer-level emissions are generally not feasible because of high administrative costs and producer transaction costs. In contrast, incentive policies based on sectoral emissions are likely administratively feasible, even in developing countries. This study uses an economic model of global agriculture to estimate the effects of two sectoral mitigation policies: a carbon tax and an emissions trading scheme based on average national methane emissions per unit of commodity. The analysis shows how the composition and location of livestock production and emissions change in response to the policies. Results illustrate the importance of global mitigation efforts: when policies are limited to Annex 1 countries, increased methane emissions in non-Annex 1 countries offset approximately two-thirds of Annex 1 emissions reductions. While non-Annex 1 countries face substantial disincentives to enacting domestic carbon taxes, developing countries could benefit from participating in a global sectoral emissions trading scheme. We illustrate one scheme in which non-Annex 1 countries collectively earn USD 2.4 billion annually from methane emission permit sales when methane is priced at USD 30/t CO_2-eq.",2012-05-01,10.1007/s10584-011-0206-6,"['Key, Nigel', 'Tallard, Gregoire']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-011-0206-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit trade"")",springer

Initially, first- as well as second-generation panel unit root tests are applied to check the integration order after confirming the cross-sectional dependency and heterogeneity. Four different tests (FMOLS, DOLS, FGLS, and AMG) are applied to estimate the long-run elasticity, whereas Dumitrescu and Hurlin (D-H) non-causality test is used to test growth, conservation, and feedback hypothesis. Results show negative relationship of economic growth on ecological footprint in Africa and Europe; renewable energy utilization in Asia, Europe, and America; and trade openness in Asia. Moreover, the results revealed an adverse impact of trade openness on ecological footprint in case of Africa and America. Furthermore, the results of D-H panel non-causality test confirm the growth hypothesis for economic growth to ecological footprint in Africa, Asia, and Europe; foreign direct investment to ecological footprint in Africa and Asia; primary energy utilization to ecological footprint in Asia; renewable energy utilization to ecological footprint in America; and trade openness to ecological footprint in Africa, Asia, and America. Furthermore, the feedback hypothesis was confirmed between economic growth and ecological footprint in Asia and Europe; foreign direct investment and ecological footprint in Africa and Asia; renewable energy utilization and ecological footprint for America; and trade openness and ecological footprint for Asia and America. Finally, in context to efficient policy implications, it is suggested to associate the economic growth with clean energy and environment-friendly technologies by expanding the share of renewable energy in America and economic growth in Africa and Europe. Furthermore, Asian policy makers need to focus on foreign direct investment and trade openness by using green energy to overcome the environmental degradation. Impulsion with these findings, the central authorities of UMICs need to focus on more investments in environmental quality not only through foreign direct investment but also exchanging their clean energy technologies through trade policies such as tax exemption, feed-in tariffs, and subsidies.

464,Value addition in the services sector and its heterogeneous impacts on CO_2 emissions: revisiting the EKC hypothesis for the OPEC using panel spatial estimation techniques,"This study examines the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in the context of 12 members of the OPEC by utilizing data on both the aggregate gross value added and the services’ sectoral value-added between 1992 and 2015. This empirical work contributes to the literature by applying the panel spatial techniques which resulted in the findings as follows. Firstly, the results verify the authenticity of the EKC hypothesis for the aggregate level of gross value added as perceived from its inverted-U shaped association with CO2 emissions. Secondly, the disaggregated analysis affirms the heterogeneity of the validity of the EKC hypothesis across the subsectors within the services sector; this justifies the importance of analyzing the EKC hypothesis from a comprehensive (disaggregated) perspective for unearthing key sector-specific policy implications. The results reveal that the EKC hypothesis holds only in the context of construction services only but not for the cases of restaurant services, tourism and transportation services. These key findings call for effective measures to be undertaken to address the adverse environmental impacts that can be attributed to thse three sub-sectors for which the EKC did not hold. In line with the overall findings from the empirical exercises, it is recommended that the concerned OPEC members reduce their monotonic dependency on the consumption of fossil fuels, oil in particular, and gradually incorporate renewable energy resources into the energy-mix particularly within their respective services sector.",2020-07-07,10.1007/s11356-020-09593-4,"['Murshed, Muntasir', 'Nurmakhanova, Mira', 'Elheddad, Mohamed', 'Ahmed, Rizwan']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-09593-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
465,Research on coupling degree and coupling path between China’s carbon emission efficiency and industrial structure upgrading,"To coordinate economic development and carbon emission reduction targets, China needs to improve carbon emission efficiency and upgrade the industrial structure. Therefore, it is important to study the coupling degree and coupling path between these two factors in various provinces in China, and thereby promote the development of China’s low-carbon economy. We first calculate carbon emission efficiency using the Super-SBM model, then analyze an extended coupling model between carbon emission efficiency and industrial structure upgrading, and finally design the coupling paths using the framework of distribution dynamics. There are three main findings. First, the coupling degree of nearly half the provinces is at the level of mild-to-moderate imbalance recession. And in terms of specific coupling characteristics, nearly half the provinces belong to the type “low-level coordination,” with a low development degree and high coordination degree. Second, there is an obvious dynamic imbalance between China’s carbon emission efficiency and industrial structure upgrading, and the “low-level trap” of regional carbon emission efficiency is more serious than that of regional industrial structure upgrading. Finally, if the government prioritizes provinces with low carbon emission efficiency, carbon emission efficiency and the coupling efficiency with industrial structure can be improved, which would not only improve the coupling degree within each region but also alleviate the disharmony between regions.",2020-07-01,10.1007/s11356-020-08993-w,"['Zhou, Di', 'Zhang, Xiaoru', 'Wang, Xueqin']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-08993-w,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
466,Driving forces of China’s multisector CO_2 emissions: a Log-Mean Divisia Index decomposition,"To figure out which factor contributes more on carbon emissions caused by energy consumption, this research took multisector analysis based on the Log-Mean Divisia Index Method (LMDI) and decoupling theory to assess the driving factors of carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions in China’s six sectors from 2003 to 2016. Our empirical results reveal that China’s economy can be divided as three decoupling stages and exhibited a distinct tendency toward strong decoupling with a turning point in 2008. Thus, we discuss the impact of 2008 economic crisis on carbon emissions based on decomposition results. The empirical results of our study show the following five conclusions. (1) Most sectors in China are in weak decoupling state due to the inhibition of energy intensity on carbon emissions. (2) Different factors contribute differently to reducing emissions in different sectors, economic output has the most prominent effect, followed by energy intensity and population scale. (3) China’s current carbon emission reduction measures benefit more on energy efficiency. (4) The economic crisis has greatly reduced energy efficiency and has no significant impact on other factors. (5) If all industries adjust their energy mix, carbon emissions in China can be reduced by almost 17% every year.",2020-07-01,10.1007/s11356-020-08490-0,"['Pan, Wei', 'Tu, Haiting', 'Hu, Cheng', 'Pan, Wulin']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-08490-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
467,Can sustainable operations achieve economic benefit and energy saving for manufacturing industries in China?,"China has launched energy quota right trading system, as one of the sustainable operations, since 2016 to cap the total energy consumption, however the economic and energy saving effect of this new policy is unclear. Based on the input and output panel data of China’s 29 manufacturing sub-industries, this paper constructs the non-parametric optimization model under the command-and-control and the energy quota right trading scenario, to compare their potential economic gains and energy savings of these two polices for Chinese manufacturing industries. Results show that, whether at overall level or at the sub-industries level, the economic potential and energy-saving potential from energy quota right trading are higher than those from command-and-control. However, a part of energy-saving potential will be squeezed out due to the negative externality of the energy market trading.

468,Using Kaya and LMDI models to analyze carbon emissions from the energy consumption in China,"China has become the largest carbon-emitting country in the world since 2007. To achieve national environmental goals by 2030, the carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) will need to fall to 60–65% of 2005 levels. Such a dramatic decrease presents a challenge for a nation in adjusting its energy source and usage, but via monitoring of reductions, greater understanding can be gained of how carbon emitters are responding to national goals. We analyzed the change in carbon emissions from China’s fossil energy consumption from population, per capita GDP, energy efficiency improvements and energy structure using a Kaya identity model and Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) factor decomposition method from 2006 to 2018. Results suggest that trends in carbon emissions from 2006 to 2018 can be broken down into four periods: a rapid increase period during 2006–2011, a slowdown increase period during 2011–2014, a consecutive decline period during 2014–2016 and a rebound during 2017–2018. Trends in carbon emissions were greatly affected by per capita GDP and energy efficiency. While per capita GDP increased carbon emissions, energy efficiency had a countering effect on carbon emissions. Our results suggests that China’s measures in the past decade to reduce carbon emissions (i.e. carrying out carbon emissions trading on a fixed basis, readjusting the economic structure, optimizing the energy structure, improving energy efficiency and increasing forest carbon sinks) have helped to reduce carbon emissions. However, China should continue to actively respond to climate change while striving to achieve of economic sustainable development and social progress.",2020-07-01,10.1007/s11356-020-09075-7,"['Yang, Pingguo', 'Liang, Xiao', 'Drohan, Patrick J.']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-09075-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Evidence from belt and road countries,"This study examines the effect of financial development (FD) and foreign direct investment (FDI) on the environmental quality for the panel of 90 belt and road countries from 1990 to 2017. This study advances the knowledge of financial development by using the new comprehensive index, which is based on access, depth, and efficiency of financial markets and financial institutions and incorporated foreign direct investment as an important determinant of environmental quality. By applying the Driscoll-Kraay standard error pooled ordinary least square method, the empirical findings reveal that FD deteriorates the environmental quality by increasing the CO_2 emissions, while FDI improves environmental quality and the relationship between economic growth (EG) and CO_2 emissions is inverted U-shaped, i.e., presence of EKC hypothesis. The energy consumption and urbanization pollute the environment, while trade openness enhances the quality of the environment. Furthermore, the Dumitrescu-Hurlin (DH) panel causality test result confirms that the bidirectional causality exists among FD, trade openness, energy consumption, and urbanization with CO_2 emissions.

470,Carbon emissions and carbon trade balances: International evidence from panel ARDL analysis,"International trade plays crucial roles in the evolution of carbon emissions given the prevalence of complex global supply chains. Production reallocation across countries promotes the cross-border trade of emission-embodied products and is closely related to emission transfer or carbon trade balance, which is defined as the difference between territorial and consumption emissions. One important issue addressed in this study is how carbon trade balances relate to carbon emissions under a globalized world with fragmented production. By applying a panel-pooled mean group-autoregressive distributive lag (PMG-ARDL) model, we evaluate the long-run relevance between carbon emissions and carbon trade balances while considering the short-run dynamics over 58 countries during the period of 1990–2014. The main results reveal a positive relationship between carbon trade balances and carbon emissions for high-income countries but no clear evidence for low-income countries. Our analysis argues that a high-income country may achieve emission reduction not only by displacing production units to trading partners but also by transferring high emission-intensive production units to trading partners and by keeping low emission-intensive domestic production units. Our results provide some important implications about emissions embodied in trade and emission transfers via international trade. First, high-income countries, particularly emission importers, should have the greater responsibility for global emission issues and should continue to develop and improve energy-saving and less emission-intensive technology. Second and more importantly, high-income countries should promote spillovers of advanced green technology to trading partners when they outsource emission-intensive production units to low-income countries.",2020-07-01,10.1007/s11356-020-08478-w,"['Hotak, Shukria', 'Islam, Moinul', 'Kakinaka, Makoto', 'Kotani, Koji']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-08478-w,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
471,Direct and indirect impacts of high-tech industry development on CO_2 emissions: empirical evidence from China,"Vigorously developing high-tech industry has been considered to be an effective way to coordinate economic growth with excessive carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions. However, previous studies have not explored the heterogeneous impacts of high-tech industry on CO_2 emissions in regions with different levels of high-tech industry development, and not distinguished the direct and indirect impacts. Based on STIRPAT model, this study investigates the impacts of high-tech industry development on CO_2 emissions in China between 2005 and 2016. Adopting the K-medians cluster method, effects in regions with high, middle, and low levels of high-tech industry development are considered. Indirect effects of high-tech industry development on CO_2 emissions by affecting industry structure upgrades and economic growth are explored. Empirical results illustrate a positive U-shaped nonlinear link between the level of high-tech industry development and CO_2 emissions at the national level and regional (high, middle, and low) level. In terms of indirect impacts, high-tech industry development attenuates the reduction of CO_2 emissions due to industry structure upgrades, and promotes economic growth to increase CO_2 emissions slightly. The indirect impact intensity gradually decreases as the level of high-tech industry development decreases across three regions. Reasonable implications of our findings are proposed.",2020-07-01,10.1007/s11356-020-09071-x,"['Gu, Wei', 'Liu, Di', 'Wang, Chen', 'Dai, Shufen', 'Zhang, Donghui']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-09071-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

473,MRV framework and prospective scenarios to monitor and ratchet up Brazilian transport mitigation targets,"Transitioning from a carbon-intensive development path to a low-carbon economy requires understanding of emission sources and its drivers. To achieve Nationally Determined Contribution targets discussed under the Paris Agreement, countries must project emission baselines considering different levels of ambition and sectoral performances and monitor government policies and mitigation actions. This study develops a Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) framework based on energy use and carbon emission scenarios for Brazil up to 2030, focusing on transport. Three scenarios are developed based on different political commitments. All scenarios and mitigation actions are discussed under the Brazilian Forum on Climate Change, which is recognized as one of the most important institutional instruments of the National Policy on Climate Change. Results reveal a 41% abatement in CO_2e emissions when comparing the most ambitious scenario to the conservative one. MRV framework indicates that Brazil is on track to a low carbon economic transition, although joint action is needed. This is mainly due to the increasing penetration of bioenergy into the transport energy matrix, while electromobility does not expand in Brazil at the pace of major international players such as Europe and China. Special contribution of this paper is on the role of bioenergy in prospective carbon emission scenarios, which is a lack in the literature.",2020-06-27,10.1007/s10584-020-02767-6,"['Goes, George Vasconcelos', 'Gonçalves, Daniel Neves Schmitz', 'Almeida D’Agosto, Márcio', 'Rovere, Emilio Lèbre', 'Mello Bandeira, Renata Albergaria']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-020-02767-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
474,Indicator system to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of China clean power systems,"The mitigation of climate change demands a transition to low-carbon power generation systems. To identify effective transition strategies and accelerate the transition process, decision-makers require comprehensive information that can best be obtained through an evaluation of transition trajectories. However, little work has been done to develop comprehensive analysis systems that can evaluate this process. This study presents an indicator system to evaluate power system transitions that include 13 indicators capturing the technical, economic, environmental and policy dimensions. To test its efficacy, the dynamic target framework is applied to the power system transition in China, and comparisons are drawn against global market leaders such as Germany, the USA and Japan. This paper finds that the framework enables a more rigorous comparative analysis of power system transitions between countries than is currently offered by the application of piecemeal indicators. This framework complements contextually rich qualitative case studies. Empirical analysis shows that China’s transition trajectory has been convoluted because of its more severe environmental restrictions and policy guidance. Cooperation in the intelligent transition of the global power system can promote China’s power system transition. This approach should foster both the mitigation of climate change and adaptation to China’s resource constraints.",2020-06-25,10.1007/s11027-020-09925-2,"['Nie, Yan', 'Zhang, Guoxing']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-020-09925-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

In this perspective, this article aims to link environmental responsive entrepreneurship with sustainable development through empirical evidences from developing country. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to validate the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis to confirm the achievement of sustainable development goals in Pakistan. We use the combined mean estimator of the autoregressive distribution lag model and GMM model to determine the long-term relationship between the variables and analyze the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis.

476,The effect of environmental regulation intensity deviation on China’s inclusive growth,"This is the first attempt to explore the impact of environmental regulation intensity deviation on inclusive growth. An analysis framework in which the deviation between actual intensity and optimal intensity affects inclusive growth is constructed. Based on this analytical framework, this study uses panel data from 281 prefecture-level cities in China during the period 2004–2016 to investigate environmental regulation intensity deviation, as well as the feature, heterogeneity, and mechanisms of environmental regulation intensity deviation affecting inclusive growth. The empirical findings show that (i) environmental regulation has an inverted U-shaped effect on inclusive growth, but the actual intensity of environmental regulation in China is lower than the optimal intensity, which makes it difficult to give full play to its incentive role on inclusive growth; (ii) further grouping tests show that environmental regulation intensity deviation will inhibit inclusive growth within regions but promote inclusive growth between regions due to the difference in deviation; (iii) technological innovation, industrial transformation, and foreign investment have a partial mediating effect, which may be important mechanisms for environmental regulation intensity deviation to restrain inclusive growth; and (iv) the robustness test of informal environmental regulation supports the findings of formal environmental regulation and finds that the deviation of informal environmental regulation is more severe than that of formal environmental regulation. The empirical findings therefore suggest that policymakers should scientifically improve the environmental regulation intensity and optimize the environmental regulatory structure.",2020-06-16,10.1007/s11356-020-09574-7,"['Ge, Tao', 'Li, Jinye']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-09574-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Simply reviving the existing ‘brown’ economy will exacerbate irreversible climate change and other environmental risks. For G20 economies, investing in a workable and affordable green transition is essential. A good place to start is learning what worked and what did not from previous efforts to green the economic recovery during the 2008–2009 Great Recession, examining the cases of the United States and South Korea. Policies for a sustained economic recovery amount to much more than just short-term fiscal stimulus.

478,Study on the influence of carbon emission constraints on the performance of thermal power enterprises,"With the increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, the living environment of human beings is seriously affected. As a high carbon emission industry in China, thermal power enterprises are the key areas of carbon emission reduction in China. This paper first uses Super-SBM model to measure the performance of China’s 18 major thermal power enterprises in 2009–2018 from a static point of view. After considering the carbon emission constraints, it analyzes the degree of change in enterprise performance, and finds that the impact of carbon emission constraints on enterprise performance is not absolute. After that, with the help of Malmquist index model, this paper discusses the dynamic changes of thermal power enterprises’ performance under carbon emission constraint in recent 10 yrs. The results show that the overall performance of carbon emission constraint is in a weak regression stage and summarizes the disadvantages of different enterprises.

479,Do the performance and efficiency of China’s carbon emission trading market change over time?,"Whether or not China can succeed at the forefront of international development in the coming decades will largely hinge on its ability to adapt to low-carbon economic development and its efforts to promote the Unified National Emission Trading System (UNETS). To understand the evolution of China’s carbon market, this paper firstly divides the development of China’s regional carbon markets into three phases: pilot construction (phase 1, before 31 May 2015), preparation for the UNETS (phase 2, 1 June 2015–19 December 2017), and formal construction of the UNETS (phase 3, 20 December 2017–present). Then this research reviews the trading performance and employs four robust variance ratio (VR) tests to capture structural changes and examine the efficiency of China’s eight regional carbon markets in different periods. Results show that compared to phase 1, smaller price volatility, larger daily trading volume, and higher market liquidity are more frequent at the later stages of majority markets. Despite these improvements, results from the VR tests indicate that the statistic in majority of China’s regional carbon markets is insignificant in any given period and, therefore, they are not weak-form efficient. The additional detrended cross-correlation analysis demonstrates that market liquidity affects market efficiency in the Hubei market only, which implies that Hubei, where the market liquidity reaches almost 100% in phase 3, is highly likely to be weak-form efficient shortly. Finally, several recommendations are provided to improve the efficiency and maturity of China’s carbon markets, including strengthening legislation, improving the market design, and constructing information platforms.",2020-06-11,10.1007/s11356-020-09168-3,"['Zhang, Shiyi', 'Jiang, Kai', 'Wang, Lan', 'Bongers, Geoff', 'Hu, Guoping', 'Li, Jia']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-09168-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
480,Understanding the economic impact of interacting carbon pricing and renewable energy policy in China,"Climate change is posing risks for human and natural systems, and one of the most important questions faced by policy makers is to reduce such risks and impacts through adaption and mitigation actions. As the country with the highest CO_2 emissions, China is facing unprecedented challenges: climate change, energy structure transformation and socio-economic development all pose complex dilemmas for policy makers. The Chinese government has introduced energy policy and emission reduction measures to achieve its climate change mitigation targets. However, overlap between these measures may generate great uncertainty about their performance. By using a multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this study examines the economic impacts of implementing a nationwide carbon market and a renewable energy subsidy in the power sector in China. The study finds that a renewable energy policy would increase the economic cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and lead to a lower carbon price level if a carbon pricing mechanism were in place. However, the combination of the two policies indeed shows advantages in achieving emission reduction targets and renewable energy promotion targets. While an emission trading scheme is necessary for reducing emissions effectively, a renewable energy policy could promote the large-scale use of renewable energy in the electricity sector. In addition, the adoption of a renewable energy policy could yield substantial inter-regional capital inflow to central and western regions. This would improve low-carbon investment in less developed regions, and thus an appropriately designed policy mix would be sensible.",2020-06-10,10.1007/s10113-020-01663-0,"['Wu, Jie', 'Fan, Ying', 'Timilsina, Govinda', 'Xia, Yan', 'Guo, Renyong']",Regional Environmental Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10113-020-01663-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
481,Leader-follower optimized approach for carbon-economy equilibrium in the municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration industry,"Municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration contributes significantly to carbon emissions, and has become a serious problem in China, which has seen an exponential rise in waste over the last twenty years due to rapid urbanization and the associated consumer economy growth. To tackle this issue, this paper develops a leader-follower optimized approach for economic and environmental equilibrium in incineration power plants that includes a carbon allowance allocation scheme (IPP-CAAS) under combustion and pollutant limitations. In the leader-follower (bi-level) game, the regional authority on the upper level determines the carbon allocations and environmental targets and the IPPs on the lower level develop schemes to maximize revenue under the upper-level restrictions. By employing uncertain parameters for the carbon and power conversion fluctuations, the approach is able to more accurately depict the industry characteristics of waste incineration process in this carbon-economy balance problem. The robustness and practicality of the proposed methodology was then validated through a case study. Scenario analysis under different political parameters indicates that the proposed methodology can assist the authorities to achieve carbon-economy trade-off and under serious carbon-control situations, encourage the IPPs to reduce their blended coal ratios, and invest in low-carbon incineration technology.

It was found that the SO_2 emission trading system significantly promoted corporate innovation but did not have a significant effect on corporate productivity. The cause analysis showed that suboptimal institutional context and lack of corporate dynamic response led to the failure of strong Porter hypothesis effect. In addition, small- and medium-sized enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises gained greater innovation compensation effects of the emission trading system. This research believed that, the design, institutional context, and market incentives of emission trading systems need to be improved from the top down, to achieve the dual goal of environmental sustainability and economic growth.",2020-06-01,10.1007/s11356-020-08566-x,"['Tang, Hong-li', 'Liu, Jian-min', 'Mao, Jun', 'Wu, Jin-guang']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-08566-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
483,Governing energy consumption in China: a comprehensive assessment of the energy conservation target responsibility system,"The governance of energy consumption in China is of environmental significance from the standpoints of preventing local air pollution and global climate change. At the heart of China’s energy governance system is the energy conservation target responsibility system (ECTRS). This article examines this important governance instrument from three key aspects. First, it explains the role of the ECTRS in China’s authoritarian yet decentralized governance system. Second, it traces the development of the ECTRS over the last decade, with a specific focus on the reforms introduced in the 13th 5-Year Plan (2016–2020), particularly the energy caps.

484,Impact of green finance on economic development and environmental quality: a study based on provincial panel data from China,"The goal of green finance is to pursue the coordinated development of financial activities, environmental protection, and ecological balance. This study aims to examine the impact of green finance on economic development and environmental quality. Data concerning green finance, economic development, and environmental quality for 30 provinces and municipalities in China from 2010 to 2017 are used. First, the global principal component analysis is adopted to develop a green finance development index. Second, a model of the impact of green finance on economic development is constructed, which indicates that the development of green finance plays a role in promoting economic development. Next, emissions of industrial smoke (powder) dust, industrial solid waste, and carbon dioxide are used to represent the environmental variables, and a model of the impact of green finance on environmental quality is proposed. The model shows that green finance has a positive effect on environment improvement. However, the impact of green finance on environmental quality varies for different levels of economic development. Finally, based on the theory of the environmental Kuznets curve, a model of the impact of green finance on the relationship between economic development and environmental quality is developed. The model indicates that green finance can significantly improve this relationship, creating a win-win situation regarding economic development and the environment.",2020-06-01,10.1007/s11356-020-08383-2,"['Zhou, Xiaoguang', 'Tang, Xinmeng', 'Zhang, Rui']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-08383-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
485,Measuring and Improving Eco-efficiency,"As energy and environmental issues continue to generate social concerns, firms are pushed to alleviate their energy and environmental externalities from economic activities and network operations while pursuing economic interests. A comprehensive performance evaluation involving both productive and environmental factors is therefore desired by firms to aggregate multiple aspects into condensed information to facilitate decision-making. In this study, we develop a new eco-efficiency measure for energy-intensive economic activities, which integrates productive and environmental factors in the presence of undesirable outputs. The proposed measure has the following merits in comparison with a majority of existing ones that have been widely used in energy- and environment-related areas. It guarantees Pareto-Koopmans eco-efficiency because only non-dominated entities are measured as eco-efficient. It also captures any actual fluctuations in inputs, desirable outputs, and undesirable outputs, as it proves to be strongly monotonic in all input and output dimensions. It has a positive significance for promoting undesirable output abatement, because it stimulates scale improvement for entities in pursuit of economies of scale. It also provides great flexibility of improvement for individual inputs and outputs to achieve eco-efficiency. The marginal abatement costs of undesirable outputs are estimated to facilitate managing the potential tradeoff between undesirable output abatement and desirable output production. We also extend it to weighted eco-efficiency measures for specific situations wherever necessary. Its practicability and comparison with existing models are illustrated by an empirical example.",2020-06-01,10.1007/s10666-019-09679-5,"['Chen, Jin-Xiao', 'Chen, Jian']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10666-019-09679-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
486,The distributionally robust optimization model for a remanufacturing system under cap-and-trade policy: a newsvendor approach,"This paper considers a remanufacturing system in which the remanufacturer uses both the fresh raw material and recycled material to produce new products. Only partial information of the demand distribution, including the mean and variance, is available in this system. The operational activities of the remanufacturer are major contributors to carbon emissions, and a government agency imposes a cap-and-trade (carbon emission trading) policy on the remanufacturer. In the context of the distributionally robust newsvendor model, a maxmin approach is used to solve the optimal joint collection and production quantities. To study whether implementation of a cap-and-trade policy improves the remanufacturer’s expected profit and reduces corresponding carbon emissions, the case where the government agency does not impose cap-and-trade policy is considered and compared. Finally, numerical analysis is conducted to illustrate and complement the analytical results and to investigate the influences of several main parameters on the distributionally robust newsvendor model for the remanufacturing system under a cap-and-trade policy.",2020-05-29,10.1007/s10479-020-03642-4,"['Bai, Qingguo', 'Xu, Jianteng', 'Zhang, Yuzhong']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-020-03642-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
487,Revisiting the pollution haven hypothesis in ASEAN-5 countries: new insights from panel data analysis,"Pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) has been investigated extensively in the existing literature due to global environmental issues such as global warming and climate change. However, there is still no consensus on whether this hypothesis is valid. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the validity of the PHH in ASEAN-5 countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) covering the period of 1981–2014. It is utilized the up-to-date panel data techniques taking cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity into account to test the relationship. According to the results of CCEMG and AMG estimators, the validity of the PHH is confirmed in ASEAN-5 countries. The increase in foreign direct investments (FDI) increases environmental degradation in these countries. Our additional findings show that the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis (EKC) is also valid in these countries. There is an inverted U shape between economic growth and CO2 emissions.

489,Assessing the impact of ETS trading profit on emission abatements based on firm-level transactions,"Carbon emission trading is an important market-based policy instrument to reduce GHG emission using reward-punishment mechanism. Here the authors show that the EU emission trading schemes operate at its designed purpose and there is a positive and linear relationship between firm profits and the firms’ efforts in abatement. The EU Emission Trading System (ETS) is the oldest and currently the largest carbon market in the world, but its purpose of stimulating carbon emissions via trading profits remains unexamined. Based on the complete firm-level transaction records of the EU ETS Phases I and II, here we show that the participating firms’ trading profits and their emission abatements are positively correlated, and the correlation becomes stronger in Phase II than Phase I. Specifically, we observe that non-linearity exists in the correlation; higher firm-level emission abatements can realize larger trading profits. This pattern affects the market fairness, though it may be helpful to incentivise emission abatements. The correlation is more regulated in Phase II than it is in Phase I, thereby indicating that the Phase II is more mature. We also observe that the state-level abatements are largely driven by industrial giants.",2020-04-29,10.1038/s41467-020-15996-1,"['Guo, Jianfeng', 'Gu, Fu', 'Liu, Yinpeng', 'Liang, Xi', 'Mo, Jianlei', 'Fan, Ying']",Nature Communications,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15996-1.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

However, information on its remaining population and distribution are limited. We mapped the current K. ivorensis spatial distribution, modelled the spatial autocorrelation and estimated its economic value using volume estimation and market pricing. The study was conducted in Odigbo and Irele local government areas (LGA), Ondo State, Nigeria. Spatially, localities of 97  K. ivorensis were identified across the study area and can be added into a wide range of datasets from local to global inventories. Large trees in diameter and height were statistically clustered in the north of Odigbo and assumed to relate with forest reserve management. Estimated median tree volumes were 0.39 m^3 and 0.31 m^3 in accordance with the allometric volume function and specific volume function, respectively.

491,"Structural, Innovation and Efficiency Effects of Environmental Regulation: Evidence from China’s Carbon Emissions Trading Pilot","Conventional wisdom argues that environmental regulation can trigger both structural adjustments and enhanced innovation. We test this conjecture by using a difference-in-differences approach to analyze the impacts of China’s carbon emission trading (CET) pilot policy on energy consumption. We find that compliance with the CET regulation has triggered statistically significant adjustments in energy structure, industrial structure, and technological innovation. Adjustments in industrial structure also contribute to enhanced total factor energy efficiency, whereas increased technological innovation has mixed effects on energy efficiency. We show that in the short run, government-led innovation does not immediately contribute to improvement in energy efficiency, whereas enterprise-led innovation has a negative impact. It indicates that CET regulation can affect energy efficiency through industrial structure and technological innovation. Overall, our results provide new evidence for the strong version of the Porter hypothesis.

492,Does emission trading scheme have spillover effect on industrial structure upgrading? Evidence from the EU based on a PSM-DID approach,"The coordinated development of environmental pollution and the economy has become a global problem. Emission trading scheme (ETS) has become a significant environmental policy instrument, prior studies primarily concentrated on micro-level factors with specific industries; there lacks discussion on the effects of ETS on macro-level industrial structure such as industrial structure upgrading. In this paper, we first use the propensity score matching (PSM) to screen out the control group in which countries are matched with the members of the EU, and then utilize the difference-in-differences (DID) method, to examine the effects of ETS implementation on national industrial structure upgrading in the members of the EU. Empirical results show that the EU ETS may does not have a significant impact on industrial structure change, while the implementation of EU ETS has significantly promoted the upgrading of the country’s industrial structure, and the policy effect of EU ETS on industrial structure upgrading gradually increases as time goes by and there is a dynamic effect.

493,A Novel Decomposition-Ensemble Based Carbon Price Forecasting Model Integrated with Local Polynomial Prediction,"This study proposes a decomposition-ensemble based carbon price forecasting model, which integrates ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) with local polynomial prediction (LPP). The EEMD method is used to decompose carbon price time series into several components, including some intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residue. Motivated by the fully local characteristics of a time series decomposed by EEMD, we adopt the traditional LPP and regularized LPP (RLPP) to forecast each component. This led to two forecasting models, called the EEMD-LPP and EEMD-RLPP, respectively. Based on the fine-to-coarse reconstruction principle, an auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach is used to forecast the high frequency IMFs, and LPP and RLPP is applied to forecast the low frequency IMFs and the residue. The study also proposes two other forecasting models, called the EEMD-ARIMA-LPP and EEMD-ARIMA-RLPP. The empirical study results showed that the EEMD-LPP and EEMD-ARIMA-LPP outperform the two other models. Furthermore, we examine the robustness and effects of parameter settings in the proposed model. Compared with existing state-of-art approaches, the results demonstrate that EEMD-ARIMA-LPP and EEMD-LPP can achieve higher level and directional predictions and higher robustness. The EEMD-LPP and EEMD-ARIMA-LPP are promising approaches for carbon price forecasting.",2020-04-01,10.1007/s10614-018-9862-1,"['Qin, Quande', 'He, Huangda', 'Li, Li', 'He, Ling-Yun']",Computational Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10614-018-9862-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
494,Integrating cost information in energy efficiency measurement: An empirical study on thermal power companies,"Energy saving and emission reduction sometimes mean high cost, so companies do not have enough motivation to always support the related policy. By neglecting the economic cost and the imperfect substitution among input factors, widely used energy efficiency indicators such as “energy intensity” will sometimes lead to uneconomic results. Based on the theory of economic efficiency, “energy economic efficiency” is proposed as a new energy efficiency measurement to integrate cost information. In this paper, we further discuss energy economic efficiency, propose supplementary properties, and measure the efficiency of twelve public thermal power companies during the period of China’s 12th five-year plan. Our results show that (2) the economic efficiency of the twelve public companies decreased slowly. The average economic efficiency was 0.82, and there was approximately 40 billion RMB in potential cost savings in 2015, accounting for 18% of the total cost. (2) The energy economic efficiency of these twelve companies increased by approximately 10% during 2011–2015. (3) The primary mission of most thermal power company is to improve the coal combustion technology.

495,Lipase immobilized on functionalized superparamagnetic few-layer graphene oxide as an efficient nanobiocatalyst for biodiesel production from Chlorella vulgaris bio-oil,"Background Microalgae, due to its well-recognized advantages have gained renewed interest as potentially good feedstock for biodiesel. Production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as a type of biodiesel was carried out from Chlorella vulgaris bio-oil. Biodiesel was produced in the presence of nano-biocatalysts composed of immobilized lipase on functionalized superparamagnetic few-layer graphene oxide via a transesterification reaction. A hybrid of few-layer graphene oxide and Fe_3O_4 (MGO) was prepared and characterized. The MGO was functionalized with 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (MGO–AP) as well as with a couple of AP and glutaraldehyde (MGO–AP–GA). The Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) was immobilized on MGO and MGO–AP using electrostatic interactions as well as on MGO–AP–GA using covalent bonding. The supports, MGO, MGO–AP, and MGO–AP–GA, as well as nano-biocatalyst, ROL/MGO, ROL/MGO–AP, and ROL/MGO–AP–GA, were characterized using FESEM, VSM, FTIR, and XRD. The few-layer graphene oxide was characterized using AFM and the surface charge of supports was evaluated with the zeta potential technique. The nano-biocatalysts assay was performed with an evaluation of kinetic parameters, loading capacity, relative activity, time-course thermal stability, and storage stability. Biodiesel production was carried out in the presence of nano-biocatalysts and their reusability was evaluated in 5 cycles of transesterification reaction. Results The AFM analysis confirmed the few-layer structure of graphene oxide and VSM also confirmed that all supports were superparamagnetic. The maximum loading of ROL (70.2%) was related to MGO–AP–GA. The highest biodiesel conversion of 71.19% achieved in the presence of ROL/MGO–AP–GA. Furthermore, this nano-biocatalyst could maintain 58.77% of its catalytic performance after 5 cycles of the transesterification reaction and was the best catalyst in the case of reusability. Conclusions In this study, the synthesized nano-biocatalyst based on bare and functionalized magnetic graphene oxide was applied and optimized in the process of converting microalgae bio-oil to biodiesel for the first time and compared with bare lipase immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles. Results showed that the loading capacity, kinetic parameters, thermal stability, and storage stability improved by the functionalization of MGO.

496,"Research on the sustainable development process of low-carbon pilot cities: the case study of Guiyang, a low-carbon pilot city in south-west China","China plans to pursue low-carbon development in its low-carbon pilot cities to control greenhouse gas emissions. The low-carbon city development is an important method to achieve sustainable development strategy, while it is also a new city development mode to promote natural ecology, low-carbon economy and social happiness. However, the evaluation process of the low-carbon city is a multiple objective and decision problem. A single indicator cannot comprehensively and objectively evaluate a city’s low-carbon development level, so a comprehensive evaluation index system should be established. So taking Guiyang as a case study, this article constructs 35 evaluating indicators that are based on the basic urban development level and low-carbon urban development level to analyse the economic development, social progress and environmental quality transmutation comprehensively by using the entropy method. The results show that in the whole process of sustainable development, the economic development, social progress and the environmental quality have been greatly improved, but the low-carbon level had been on the low side from 2003 to 2016 in Guiyang. Therefore, Guiyang still has a long way to go to become a low-carbon city, and concrete policies and countermeasures should be taken to promote the low-carbon level. In particular, Guiyang has to strengthen the dual constraint of carbon emission intensity and total carbon emissions, adhere to the development path characterized by low carbon and strive to achieve leapfrog development.",2020-03-14,10.1007/s10668-020-00679-0,"['Peng, Tao', 'Deng, Hongwei']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-020-00679-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

We confirm the long-run equilibrium relationship between carbon emissions, trade openness, fossil fuel usage, and GDP through the panel cointegration tests that is robust to cross-sectional dependence. Overall, our finding is that the empirical results show no consistent evidence of the EKC hypothesis in Annex I countries via mean group and long-run estimation. Country-specific estimation shows that only 5 of the 34 countries support the EKC hypothesis. From the cointegration test to long-run vector estimation, we indirectly show that fossil fuel usage can distort the EKC results by causing endogeneity, since being strong is related to economic growth. From the synthesized statistics of empirical results, Annex I countries do not follow the EKC relationship. This could imply that because no mitigation has been achieved, climate change can become a much more serious issue, although country-specific results show that mitigation is constantly in progress.",2020-03-01,10.1007/s11356-020-07668-w,"['Jin, Taeyoung', 'Kim, Jinsoo']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-07668-w,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

This study examined the long-run relationship between ICTs, energy demand, and carbon emissions in a context of Pakistan by using a time series data from 1975 to 2017. The results show that energy demand increases economic growth in the short-run while it decreases economic growth in the long-run. The country’s economic growth substantially increases along with an increase in trade openness and mobile-telephone subscription (ICTs) in the short-run; however, the result is changed in the long-run due to increase in carbon emissions in a given time period. The results provoke that continued economic growth and ICT penetration substantially decreases energy demand, whereas urbanization increases energy demand in a country. The results show that variations in emissions associated with proportionate changes in ICTs penetration, economic growth, energy demand, and population growth. Human capital, trade openness, and energy demand are the significant drivers of ICT penetration in a country.

This article systematically reviews and compares the practices and policies of carbon trading regulation in China’s seven pilot schemes from three major aspects of regulatory institutions and subjects, regulatory objects and content, and regulatory means and techniques, and covering both internal and external regulatory architectures. The comparative analysis has demonstrated that the regional pilot schemes have made notable achievements in developing ETS regulatory systems with Chinese characteristics, but they still have considerable deficiencies.

500,Addressing climate change through a market mechanism: a comparative study of the pilot emission trading schemes in China,"The questions of how to mitigate climate change and its impact on human health are currently high on the Chinese agenda for future development. The emission trading scheme (ETS) has become one of China’s most important instruments to address climate change through a market mechanism. In the wake of the evolution from regional pilots to a nationwide scheme, it is inevitable to be confronted with tremendous political–economic–institutional challenges. To facilitate a smooth start-up of the upcoming nationwide ETS, this study provides a systematic overview of seven ETS pilots, involving the detailed comparison of ETS design and the in-depth evaluation of market performance, both internal and external performance, based on trading data. Then, the achievements and deficiencies of seven ETS pilots are summarized, several challenges for the current time are discussed, and policy proposals for China’s national-level ETS are navigated further coupled with international experience. This study finds that China’s ETS pilots, from the short-term perspective, are successful, especially in the reinforcement of China’s capacity to develop a market-based scheme in an economy that still cherishes many non-market endowments. However, deficiencies lie in both the internal and external market performance, such as the carbon price lacking a signal function, insufficient incentives for compliance, too low market liquidity, and much too high market fragmentation. Moreover, the retrospective examination of China’s ETS pilots suggests that a nationwide ETS should at least be based on an extension of the cap duration from single year to several years, uniform rules on monitoring/reporting/verification and allowance allocation, and the improvement of institutional foundation.",2020-03-01,10.1007/s10653-019-00258-x,"['Zhou, Yu', 'Jiang, Jingjing', 'Ye, Bin', 'Zhang, Yumeng', 'Yan, Jing']",Environmental Geochemistry and Health,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10653-019-00258-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
501,Overview of research on carbon information disclosure,"Against the background of addressing global climate change and carbon emission reduction, corporate carbon information disclosure (CID) has become an important measure to achieve carbon emission reduction worldwide and a research hotspot closely investigated by the academia. This study provides a systematic overview of literature on CID, including its research trend, theoretical basis, disclosing features, influencing factors, and consequences. Results indicate that, first, CID has been increasing in recent years, but the content and quality of the disclosure still need to be improved. Second, the main influencing factors of CID include company features, corporate governance, environmental performance, institutional characteristics, and stakeholders.

502,A new emission trading with bounded rational countries: a network game approach,"This paper designs a new carbon trading mechanism, that is, developed countries will give developing countries a certain amount of subsidies and require them to undertake a certain amount of additional emission reduction tasks in order to promote emission reduction of developing countries. This is equivalent to developed countries “buying emission permits” from developing countries. We study the dynamic property of this kind of emission trading and treat the trading process as a social network that exhibits network effects in which there exist only one developed country and many developing countries. Furthermore, we model the developing countries as bounded rational, i.e., they are unable to pay immediate attention to price changes. Finally, we find that the developed country’s optimal prices trajectory has the following structure: the price is low when the number of bounded countries is less than a certain level and is high when the number is greater than the target. We also show that a certain number of bounded rational developing countries are conducive to the success of emission trading.",2020-02-28,10.1007/s42452-020-2264-8,"['Chen, Weidong', 'Li, Liming']",SN Applied Sciences,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42452-020-2264-8.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

This paper constructed a multi-sector intertemporal optimization model to forecast the CO_2 emission trends of 14 industrial departments in 31 provinces of China from 2012 to 2050. The results indicate that (1) the energy efficiency level of each province will be improved continuously under the influence of technology progress, and CO_2 emissions in most provinces will reach the peak during the forecast period. (2) CO_2 emissions of metal-manufacturing industries are the highest in all provinces, and the emissions of transportation service industries, construction industries, and other service industries show a trend of gradual increase from west to east. (3) Under the influence of the capital and technology, CO_2 emissions caused by transportation service industries in eastern provinces will reach the peak earlier than those in central and western regions.

504,A Methodological Framework for Developing More Just Footprints: The Contribution of Footprints to Environmental Policies and Justice,"The rapid growth of human population and associated industrialisation creates strains on resources and climate. One way to understand the impact of human activity is to quantify the total environmental pressures by measuring the ‘footprint’. Footprints account for the total direct and/or indirect effects of a product or a consumption activity, which may be related to e.g. carbon, water or land use, and can be seen as a proxy for environmental responsibility. Footprints shape climate and resource debates, especially concerning environmental strategies. However, in general, footprints hold a dichotomous producer–consumer perspective that is not unanimously accepted. In addition, the current footprinting system transmits a simplistic message about environmental responsibility that taints the justice debate and jeopardises the validity of policies based on them. Consequently, it is crucial to question who is (and should be) accountable for adverse environmental effects. It is also critical to investigate how the methodological characteristics of footprints shape and affect the efficacy of policies on climate and natural resources. This article examines these challenges, focusing on negative justice and policy implications resulting from assigning environmental responsibility to a sole agent. The article proposes, and morally justifies, the development of a footprinting method that includes justice parameters in an attempt to render fair results that are more meaningful for environmental action. The second objective is to establish the potential of this new framework to promote environmental responsibility and justice while facilitating policymaking. The suggested justice elements aim at turning footprints into a concrete environmental policy instrument framed under the value of environmental fairness.",2020-02-01,10.1007/s11948-019-00100-8,"['Vasconcellos Oliveira, Rita']",Science and Engineering Ethics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11948-019-00100-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
505,Optimization of biogas supply networks considering multiple objectives and auction trading prices of electricity,"This contribution presents an hourly-based optimization of a biogas supply network to generate electricity, heat and organic fertilizer while considering multiple objectives and auction trading prices of electricity. The optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) utilizing a four-layer biogas supply chain. The model accounts for biogas plants based on two capacity levels of methane to produce on average 1 ± 0.1 MW and 5 ± 0.2 MW electricity. Three objectives are put forward: i) maximization of economic profit, ii) maximization of economic profit while considering cost/benefits from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (economic^+GHG profit) and iii) maximization of sustainability profit. The results show that the economic profit accrued on hourly-based auction trading prices is negative (loss), hence, four additional scenarios are put forward: i) a scenario whereby carbon prices are steadily increased to the prevalent eco-costs/eco-benefits of global warming; ii) a scenario whereby all the electricity auction trading prices are multiplied by certain factors to find the profitability breakeven factor, iii) a scenario whereby shorter time periods are applied, and investment cost of biogas storage is reduced showing a relationship between cost, volume of biogas stored and the variations in electricity production and (iv) a scenario whereby the capacity of the biogas plant is varied from 1 MW and 5 MW as it affects economics of the process. The models are applied to an illustrative case study of agricultural biogas plants in Slovenia where a maximum of three biogas plants could be selected. The results hence present the effects of the simultaneous relationship of economic profit, economic^+GHG profit and sustainability profit on the supply and its benefit to decision-making.",2020-01-08,10.1186/s42480-019-0025-5,"['Egieya, Jafaru Musa', 'Čuček, Lidija', 'Zirngast, Klavdija', 'Isafiade, Adeniyi Jide', 'Kravanja, Zdravko']",BMC Chemical Engineering,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s42480-019-0025-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
506,A combined framework for the life cycle assessment and costing of food waste prevention and valorization: an application to school canteens,"About one third of global edible food is lost or wasted along the supply chain, causing the wastage of embedded natural and economic resources. Life cycle methodologies can be applied to identify sustainable and viable prevention and valorization routes needed to prevent such inefficiencies. However, no systemic approach has been developed so far to guide practitioners and stakeholders. Specifically, the goal and scoping phase (e.g. problem assessed or system function) can be characterized by a large flexibility, and the comparability between food waste scenarios could be not ensured. Within the Horizon2020 project Resource Efficient Food and dRink for the Entire Supply cHain, this study aimed to provide practitioners with guidance on how to combine life cycle assessment and environmental life cycle costing in the context of food waste. Recent literature was reviewed to identify relevant methodological aspects, possible commonly adopted approaches, main differences among studies and standards and protocols, main challenges, and knowledge gaps. Basing on this review, an analytical framework with a set of recommendations was developed encompassing different assessment situations. The framework intends to provide a step by step guidance for food waste practitioners, and it is composed of a preliminary section on study purpose definition, three decision trees—respectively on assessment situation(s), costing approach, and type of study (footprint vs. intervention)—and two sets of recommendations. Recommendations can be applied to all levels of the food waste hierarchy, stating a generic order of preference for handling food chain side flows. This consistent and integrated life cycle approach should ensure a better understanding of the impact of specific interventions, thus supporting informed private and public decision making and promoting the design of sustainable and cost-efficient interventions and a more efficient food supply chains.",2020-01-07,10.1186/s40100-019-0148-2,"['Menna, Fabio', 'Davis, Jennifer', 'Östergren, Karin', 'Unger, Nicole', 'Loubiere, Marion', 'Vittuari, Matteo']",Agricultural and Food Economics,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40100-019-0148-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
507,Market-induced carbon leakage in China’s certified emission reduction projects,"The topic of climate change has aroused increasingly widespread concern around the world. Under the agreement at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), covened in Paris, France (Paris Agreement), which requires all Parties to undertake emission reductions, the developing countries who were once exempted from emission reduction obligations are now becoming more and more important. This study focuses on mitigation actions in China, the largest carbon emitter, as well as the largest developing country in the world. Specifically, we examine Chinese Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) projects. The objective is to compare the reduction efficiency of three types of projects: simple abatement and completely renewable energy alternative projects at the supply side and demand side projects. From market-induced carbon leakage point of view, a dual market equilibrium model was built, with results showing that the key factors affecting the leakage rates are price elasticities of both demand and supply sides and market share parameters. In most cases, renewable energy alternative projects show the least leakage rate while demand side projects show the highest. Sensitivity analysis finds that leakage rates for the three types of projects are more sensitive to price elasticity parameters than market share parameters. Moreover, factors E c de $$ {E}_c^{de} $$ (electricity price elasticity of coal demand from coal-fired generation) and E e d $$ {E}_e^d $$ (electricity price elasticity of electricity demand) affect not only the leakage rate of each project but also the comparative results between them. Although our study is based on China, the theoretical analysis is applicable in other regional voluntary emission reduction markets around the world. So, a systematic approach to comprehensively analyze the issue is summarized, based on which, we recommend two mitigation strategies to cope with the issue in offset projects in order to give managerial insights for the government. Firstly, the calculated leakage rates for different types of projects provide a new perspective to evaluate various offset projects, thus helping consider project types for priority validation. Secondly, we suggest to establish an accurate and classified discount coefficient system according to the project types to deal with the issue; the sensitivity analysis is helpful to find the most influential factors. A top-down approach to implement the strategy is proposed.",2020-01-04,10.1007/s11027-019-09904-2,"['Ye, Huiying', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Pan, Xunzhang', 'Farnoosh, Arash']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-019-09904-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Following the conceptual framework of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis and empirical IPAT framework, the analysis has been carried out. The empirical results indicate that foreign direct investment, income, and renewable energy consumption have an N-shaped association with carbon emissions. On contrary, the impact of non-renewable energy consumption on carbon emissions is positive and the impact of oil price on carbon emissions is negative. Moreover, the empirical evidence recommends long-run policies in connection with the promotion of clean technologies, less dependence on natural resources, and advancement in environmental awareness and incentives for replacing old polluting technologies.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-46847-7_1,"['Sinha, Avik', 'Driha, Oana M.', 'Balsalobre-Lorente, Daniel', 'Cantos-Cantos, José María']",Econometrics of Green Energy Handbook,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-46847-7_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
509,Non-cooperative Game Based Carbon Emission Reduction for Supply Chain Enterprises with a Cap and Trade Mechanism,"With the increasing attention of society to the environmental issues, carbon emission rights have become a new type of resource with certain commercial value, which has changed the production function and cost structure of the original enterprises. In the course of operation, enterprises have increased the consideration of carbon emission rights from the original focus on “raw materials and products (services)”. Therefore, based on the carbon and trade mechanism, this paper deeply explores the decision-making of carbon emission reduction of the upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain and the choice of government carbon quota allocation scheme under the constraint of government carbon emissions, and uses game theory knowledge to analyze the effect of carbon emission reduction of upstream and downstream enterprises under the non-cooperative game. The results show that the emission reduction effect of the government’s carbon quota per unit of product allocation is more obvious than that of the direct total amount restriction, and it is beneficial for sustainability of supply chain systems.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-21255-1_34,"['Wang, Min', 'Hou, Shuhua', 'Qiu, Rui']",Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Management Science and Engineering Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-21255-1_34,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

511,How quota allocation affects the unified ETS of China: a simulation with dynamic CGE model,"The national unified carbon trading market has been officially launched at the end of 2017. The carbon emission quotas should be primary concern, which can be allocated in the form of free and paid ways. However, few literatures studied the economic and environmental impacts of quotas allocation. Thus, this paper constructs 7 scenarios and employs a dynamic, recursive computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate carbon trading market, to probe the relationship between quota allocation and carbon price, and the economic and environmental impact of carbon trading scheme (ETS). Empirical results indicate (1) carbon price has an upward trend with time, which reflects a corresponding increase in emission reduction pressure. Specifically, carbon price increases from 12.44–90.57 CNY/t in 2017 to 65.20–523.44 CNY/t in 2030. In addition, whether under carbon intensity criterion (CIC) or carbon emission criterion (CEC), there is a positive relationship between carbon price and free allocation ratio due to the change of the relationship between supply and demand of quota. With a given free allocation ratio, the price formed with CIC grows faster than that with CEC. (2) Compared with the benchmark scenario, the GDP of China decreases in all scenarios. However, a high level of free allocation ratio combined with CIC may prevent GDP dropping too fast. (3) As for industrial output, covered industries in ETS undertake the largest output losses with an average decline by 4.03–13.60%. Similar to GDP variation, a high free allocation ratio combined with CIC is helpful for sustainable development of industry. (4) Carbon trading has a remarkable effect on emission reductions both in covered and uncovered industries of ETS. Free allocation will reduce market efficiency, which implies it should be cut down gradually at the later stages.",2020-01-01,10.1007/s11356-019-06588-8,"['Wu, Qunli', 'Li, Chunxiang']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-019-06588-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
512,Guangdong’s Carbon Trading System: A Review of Liquidity and Influencing Factors,"China’s seven carbon-trading pilots were approved for establishment in 2011 and subsequently commenced operations starting June 2014. As the largest carbon market among the seven Chinese carbon-trading pilots, Guangdong is evaluated as the second-largest carbon market in the world, only being next to the European Union (EU). These pilots instigated enormous influence on the policy formulated towards the establishment of China’s national unified carbon market in 2017 with implications for solutions to environmental and climate problems on a national and even global level. This paper mainly adopts a comparative analysis approach, first to compare the liquidity of the Guangdong carbon market nowadays with a prior period and then with the Hubei carbon market. It further compares the influencing factors of carbon market liquidity based on the former results. The analysis identifies the factors influencing the low liquidity of the Guangdong carbon market, including the separation between the primary and secondary markets, insufficient openness in the secondary market, lack of adequate investors, inadequate consideration of the distribution and collection of emission allowances, an irrational carbon finance product structure, as well as a backward trading mechanism.

Recognizing the heterogeneity of total factor CO_2 emission performances between various industrial sub-sectors is crucial for governments, to enable the compilation of effective industrial CO_2 emission reduction policies. To determine the CO_2 emission characteristics throughout the industry sectors, Liaoning province was selected as typical heavy industry province for analysis. Based on the input-output data of 37 industrial sub-sectors from 2003 to 2012, the industrial total factor CO_2 emission efficiencies and performances were analyzed through data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index. The results show that most sub-sectors have low total factor CO_2 emission efficiencies, which indicates that it is difficult for Liaoning’s industry to reduce carbon emissions. The total factor CO_2 emission performance of the overall industry declined by 1.85% per year during the study period; this decrease was mainly related to a lack in implementing technical changes. However, efficiency change showed a progressive trend.

However, little work has been able to meaningfully reflect the collaborative way in which provinces are assigned targets on a subnational regional basis. Suggesting a meta-frontier allocation approach by using data envelopment analysis (DEA), this chapter introduces the potential collaboration between heterogeneous industrial units to the modelling framework. Our theoretical work exposits the roles collectives of industrial decision making units may play in optimizing against multiple target functions, doing so whilst recognizing the two objectives of income maximization and pollution abatement cost minimization. Considering the period 2012–2014, we illustrate clearly how China’s three regional collaborations interact with the stated aims of national policy. Developed eastern China may take on greater abatement tasks in the short term, thus freeing central and western China to pursue the economic growth which will then support later abatement. Policymakers are thus given a tool through which an extra layer of implementation can be evaluated between the national allocation and setting targets for regional individual decision making units.

523,"Policy measures to promote mid-summer drainage in paddy fields for a reduction in methane gas emissions: the application of a dynamic, spatial computable general equilibrium model","Rice production is affected by climate change, while climate change is simultaneously accelerated by methane gas (CH_4) emissions from paddy fields. The rice sector must take suitable mitigation measures, such as prolonging mid-summer drainage (MSD) before the rice flowering period. To propose a mitigation policy, this study aims to demonstrate the environmental and economic effects of MSD in Japanese paddy fields by using a dynamic, spatial computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and crop model; the study also considers environmental subsidies with a carbon tax scheme to promote MSD measures. The results demonstrate that climate change under the 8.5 representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario will reduce rice prices and rice farmers’ nominal income due to bumper harvests until the 2050s. Promoting MSD in paddy fields can prevent a decrease in farmers’ nominal income and effectively reduce CH_4 emissions if all farmers adopt this measure. However, some farmers can potentially increase their own yield by avoiding MSD under high rice prices, which would be maintained through other farmers’ participation. A strong motivation exists for some farmers to gain a “free ride,” and an environmental subsidy with a carbon tax can help motivate farmers to adopt MSD. Therefore, the policy mix of prolonging MSD and environmental subsidies can increase all farmers’ incomes by preventing “free rides” and decrease greenhouse gas emissions with a slight decrease in Japan’s GDP.",2020-01-01,10.1007/s10333-019-00775-6,"['Kunimitsu, Yoji', 'Nishimori, Motoki']",Paddy and Water Environment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10333-019-00775-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

532,The Energy Policy of the European Union and Its Implications for Turkey,"Energy has played a significant role in unifying the European nations and being an apparatus for peace building in Europe since the Second World War. In the postwar period the European Coal and Steel Community brought rival countries together as allies with regard to energy resources. Today, the energy issue remains a priority within the European institutional framework. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, more ex-Soviet East European countries have become members of the European Union (EU). This wider and deeper integration has led the EU to adopt comprehensive energy policies, so it is essential to examine the facets of the EU energy policy. Moreover, because of its strategic location, Turkey has become an active player in the energy trade between the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Europe. The number of pipelines that pass across Turkey has increased since the start of the 2000s.

539,Controlling CO_2 emissions for each area in a region: the case of Japan,"Background Global warming is the most serious problem we face today. Each country is expected to ensure international cooperation toward minimizing risk. To evaluate the countermeasures, many researchers have developed integrated assessment models (IAMs). Then, how can each country achieve its emission quota? This study proposes models that analyze the economic impact of global warming in a region based on the results obtained by the global model. By using these suggested models, we perform a comparative analysis on three policy cases: a different regulations case, a unified regulation case, and an output redistribution case. Results We analyzed Japan as one of the case studies and found that more developed areas should implement stricter regulations in all scenarios. In addition, the case of applying different regulations by area (in a region) is not always preferable to using unified regulations in the region. Alternatively, the output gap between the output redistribution case and the different regulations case is much higher than the gap between the unified regulation case and the different regulations case. In all scenarios, the present values of the output of the output redistribution case are also higher than the other cases. Conclusions The different regulations case and the unified regulation case are based on the model without capital transfer between areas, whereas the output redistribution case is based on the model with free capital transfer between areas. Although both models are extreme situations, the regions close to the without capital transfer situation possibly have an incentive to use the different regulations policy, depending on the emission target. The regions close to the situation with free capital transfer would probably prefer unified regulation.",2019-12-27,10.1186/s13021-019-0135-7,"['Tamaki, Tetsuya', 'Nozawa, Wataru', 'Managi, Shunsuke']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13021-019-0135-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

541,The efforts of Taiwan to achieve NDC target: an integrated assessment on the carbon emission trading system,"In this paper, we adopt a computable general equilibrium model to investigate the impacts of achieving Taiwan’s target of nationally determined contributions (NDC). We consider two types of scenarios: one implemented with the emission trading system (ETS) and the other designed under cap without trade. Our findings suggest that Taiwan’s NDC target is achievable in two policies but with different economic costs. On the one hand, ETS reconciles the demand and supply for emission allowances. More participants in the ETS increase the chance that a buyer can match the seller; moreover, the carbon price is lower. On the other hand, in the cap-without-trade scenario, industrial sectors have to pay higher prices for emission allowances if there is no market for emission–allowance exchanges. Furthermore, we find that the initial distribution of free emission allowances affects not only sectoral emissions but also GDP loss. In 2030, the GDP loss ranges from 1.8 to 2.2% in the cap-without-trade scenario and around 1.8% in the ETS. Therefore, the ETS helps achieve Taiwan’s NDC target with a lower economic loss.

542,Study of the impact of energy consumption structure on carbon emission intensity in China from the perspective of spatial effects,"From now until 2030, China will be in a sprint to achieve reductions of 40–45% in carbon emission intensity by 2020 and 60–65% by 2030 compared to 2005; rigid requirements have thus been imposed for controlling carbon emission intensity. In this study, a spatial Durbin model that integrates a spatial lag model and a spatial error model is used to measure the degree of influence held by the energy consumption structure and other factors over carbon emission intensity and the spatial spillover effect. The results show that there is a spatial demonstration effect on the reduction in interregional carbon emission intensity in China. While the carbon emission intensity in the adjacent region decreases by 1%, the carbon emission intensity in this region will decrease by 0.05%, indicating that China’s regional low-carbon development model is also applicable to neighboring provinces and plays a large role in driving and demonstrating a low-carbon economy. Every additional 1% improvement toward optimizing the energy consumption structure enables the carbon emission intensity of the region to decrease by 0.21%; further, there is a positive spatial spillover effect driving carbon emission intensity decreases in neighboring areas of 0.25%. Industrial structure, energy intensity, energy price, and level of openness are the main factors influencing regional carbon emission intensity. According to the “14th Five-Year Plan,” there is an urgent need to optimize the energy consumption structure in the medium and long term and give full play to its ability to contribute to declines in carbon emission intensity.",2019-12-01,10.1007/s11069-018-3535-1,"['Xiao, Hongwei', 'Ma, Zhongyu', 'Zhang, Peng', 'Liu, Ming']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-018-3535-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
543,The impact of environmental regulation on firm exports: evidence from environmental information disclosure policy in China,"As an important environmental regulation tool, does the environmental information disclosure have the pollution haven effect and adversely affect Chinese export? Research on such topics can provide implications for Chinese policymakers to formulate realistic environmental policies and employ information disclosure environmental regulation tools to coordinate the economic-environmental development. Using the 2003–2013 Annual Survey of Industrial Firms Database and difference-in-difference identification, we examine the effect of environmental information disclosure policy on firm exports and its impacting mechanisms. The empirical results show that the Chinese environmental information disclosure policy has reduced the scale of industrial firms’ exports in the regulated regions, indicating the existence of the pollution heaven effect in China. And also, we find that this policy mainly inhibits export activities of enterprises in coastal areas. Considering enterprise heterogeneity, the policy plays an inhibitory role in the exports of the non-state-owned firms, large firms, and low-productivity firms. Furthermore, the impact mechanism test shows that corporate financing constraint and production costs are important channels for environmental information disclosure policy affecting corporate export activities. It implies that, in developing countries such as China, policymakers and enterprises need to adopt forward-looking strategies to reduce the negative influence of environmental constraints on corporate exports and coordinate environmental governance and sound development of enterprises.",2019-12-01,10.1007/s11356-019-06807-2,"['Fang, Jiayu', 'Liu, Cenjie', 'Gao, Chao']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-019-06807-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
544,China’s pathway to a low carbon economy,"Climate change has emerged as one of the most important environmental issues worldwide. As the world’s biggest developing country, China is participating in combating climate change by promoting a low carbon economy within the context of global warming. This paper summarizes the pathways of China’s low carbon economy including the aspects of energy, industry, low carbon cities, circular economy and low carbon technology, afforestation and carbon sink, the carbon emission trading market and carbon emission reduction targets. There are many achievements in the implementation of low carbon policies. For example, carbon emission intensity has been reduced drastically along with the optimizing of energy and industry structure and a nationwide carbon trading market for electricity industry has been established. However, some problems remain, such as the weakness of public participation, the ineffectiveness of unified policies for certain regions and the absence of long-term planning for low carbon cities development. Therefore, we propose some policy recommendations for the future low carbon economy development in China. Firstly, comprehensive and long-term planning should be involved in all the low carbon economy pathways. Secondly, to coordinate the relationship between central and local governments and narrow the gap between poor and rich regions, different strategies of carbon emission performance assessment should be applied for different regions. Thirdly, enterprises should cooperate with scientific research institutions to explored low carbon technologies. Finally, relevant institutions should be regulated to realize comprehensive low carbon transition through reasonable and feasible low carbon pathways in China.

545,Can information and communication technology reduce CO_2 emission? A quantile regression analysis,"By employing China’s provincial panel data covering period 2001–2016, the present study empirically investigates the impact of ICT on CO_2 emission intensity. Specifically, this paper utilizes Internet penetration and mobile phone penetration as proxies to measure ICT respectively and employs quantile regression method to estimate the benchmark model at five quantiles (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 0.9). It is demonstrated that Internet penetration at the national level has a significant negative effect on the CO_2 emission intensity for all quantiles. In addition, Internet penetration has a significant negative effect on CO_2 emission intensity at all quantiles except for 0.1 quantile for China’s eastern provinces and has a significant negative effect on CO_2 emission intensity at all quantiles for China’s central provinces, whereas Internet penetration has no significant negative impact on CO_2 emission intensity at all quantiles for China’s western provinces. By comparison, the reduction effect of Internet penetration on CO_2 emission intensity in China’s eastern and central provinces is more obvious and in contrast with the reduction effect of Internet penetration on CO_2 emission intensity in China’s eastern provinces, it is greater in China’s central provinces. Finally, the impact of mobile phone penetration on CO_2 emission intensity is generally consistent with the impact of Internet penetration.

546,Effect of carbon emission policy on fresh aquatic product carriers in augmented reality respective: a parallel simulation research based on genetic algorithm,"During the transportation of aquatic products, living states of the aquatic products and carbon emission of the carriers are respectively the concerns of the carrier enterprises and the government. Drivers adds virtual living states of aquatic products to the real driving environments through augmented reality technology to help themselves control oxygen contents and temperatures, and choose distribution routes. Furthermore, the effectiveness of carbon emission policy is investigated by simulating the impact of the policy on the distribution operations. In the simulation, the carriers take the minimization of overall costs of the distribution operations as the objective. In order to meet the requirements of carbon emission policies, factors of customer demands, road lengths and road congestion are used to determine the distribution. The simulation is implemented based on genetic algorithm: total costs are used as fitness values, and distribution sequences are encoded into chromosomes. And the carbon emission price is introduced as a operating parameter. Through running the simulation, we obtained the overall costs, carbon emission amounts and carbon emission costs. And a linear equation are fitted on the output data passed the reliability test.

547,Environmental implication of offshore economic activities in Indonesia: a dual analyses of cointegration and causality,"Global warming issues have become a pertinent theme for many economies and policy initiatives. The Indonesian economy is no exception as government officials and stakeholder are working seriously to decouple carbon emission from economic growth. It is on this premise that the present study attempts to investigate the nexus between the environmental implication of offshore economic activities, economic growth, energy use, and environment (CO_2) with the integration of foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade openness over recent time series data from 1980 to 2017. A series of analysis were conducted with Pesaran’s autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) methodology and the Granger causality test as estimation techniques over the outlined variables. Empirical findings from ARDL long-run (elasticity) shows that economic growth is significantly positively associated with carbon emissions at the initial stage but a negative association is established at lags 1 and 2. A significant positive relationship is witnessed between economic growth and FDI. Also, statistical positive relationship is observed between economic growth and energy use, while an inverse relationship is observed between openness and economic growth. For causality analysis, we observe that a uni-directional causality is running from economic growth to foreign direct investment at 5% significant level. This outcome is in support of the growth-induced FDI hypothesis in Indonesia. Furthermore, a one-way causality is seen from energy to openness, CO_2 emissions, and from FDI to CO_2 emissions while there is a feedback causality between openness and CO_2 emissions. The findings of this study have implications to the environmental quality of Indonesia via economic growth; hence, the higher and better the economic growth of the country, the lesser the carbon emissions and the better the environmental quality. This proposition aligns with the pollution halo hypothesis (PHH), where FDI inflow enhances economic growth as well as impacts energy consumption and reduces carbon emissions in the host country.",2019-11-01,10.1007/s11356-019-06352-y,"['Udemba, Edmund Ntom', 'Güngör, Hasan', 'Bekun, Festus Victor']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-019-06352-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
548,Renewables finance and investment: how to improve industry with private capital in China,"One purpose of stimulating financing and investment through private capital is to absorb a higher proportion of renewables and promote renewable industry development. This paper first reviews the current overall situation of renewables financing and investment, and further analyzes the policy environment with respect to the development plan, regulation and special funds. Based on the analysis of the status quo, the paper then discusses the internalities and the externalities that have driven the changes of private capital investment in renewable energy projects, illustrated by a strengths weaknesses opportunities threats (SWOT) analysis. An ideal financing model, public–private partnership and distributed energy resources pattern are analyzed to identify key arrangements and design proper development schemes for both private investors and the government. If China can overcome the defects and obstacles in a reasonable and orderly fashion, the financing and investment problem of China’s renewables industry will be solved in many ways. Private capital in the Chinese renewable energy market will bring great incentive if the entire industry can select some promising sub-industries in the renewables sector and choose some appropriate operation modes.",2019-11-01,10.1007/s40565-018-0465-6,"['LIU, Pingkuo', 'CHU, Penghao']",Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40565-018-0465-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
549,Demand signal transmission in a certified refurbishing supply chain: rules and incentive analysis,"Retailers, who sell certified refurbished products, usually have accumulated big data on demand properties, and hence, hold demand signal advantages over the other supply chain parties. In practice, we observe that this signal might be voluntarily shared to a rival who sells regular products. We are therefore interested in the incentives of demand signal transmission of the retailer selling certified refurbished products, and the value of an accurate signal for the other supply chain parties, especially in a one-to-two supply chain comprising a manufacturer (producing both regular and certified refurbished products) and two retailers (selling regular and certified refurbished products, respectively). We formulate the two retailers’ competition and demand signal properties, and find that it is of the best interest for the manufacturer to produce two products, regardless of the possible downstream competition. We derive interesting demand signal transmission rules that the retailer selling certified refurbished products would voluntarily transmit the signal to the retailer (the rival) selling regular products, while it will not transmit the signal to the upstream manufacturer (the business partner). Even if the retailer selling regular products obtains the signal, it will not transmit the signal to the manufacturer either. We discuss the resulting insights regarding the production cost reduction, the government subsidy, and the product quality improvement. We find that the signal transmission rule is robust, and the retailers’ profits may be reduced by the quality improvement of the certified refurbished product.",2019-10-22,10.1007/s10479-019-03397-7,"['Niu, Baozhuang', 'Chen, Lei', 'Zou, Zongbao', 'Ji, Ping']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-019-03397-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
550,"Feasibility of peaking carbon emissions of the power sector in China’s eight regions: decomposition, decoupling, and prediction analysis","Carbon emissions in the power sector are an important part of China’s total carbon emissions and have a significant impact on whether China can achieve the 2030 carbon peak target. Based on the three perspectives of decomposition, decoupling, and prediction, this paper studies the feasibility of carbon emission peaks in eight major regional power sectors in China. First, the generalized Divisia index model (GDIM) is used to decompose the carbon emissions of the eight regional power sectors, and the driving factors and their effects on carbon emissions in the power sector of each region are compared. Then, the decoupling index based on the generalized Divisia index model (GDIM-D) is used to study the decoupling relationship between the carbon emissions of the eight regional power sectors and economic growth. Finally, the carbon emissions and decoupling indices of the power sector from 2017 to 2030 are predicted. The results show the following. First, the gross domestic product (GDP) and output scale are the main factors contributing to the carbon emissions of the eight regional power sectors. The carbon intensity of the power sector in GDP (C/G) and output carbon intensity(C/E) are the main factors that contribute to the reduction. Second, the carbon emissions of the southern coast, the middle Yellow River, and the Southwest peaked in 2013 and have been decoupled from economic growth, while those in the other regions have not peaked or decoupled. Third, if the carbon emissions of the power sector in the Northeast, northern coast, eastern coast, middle Yangtze River, and Northwest reach a peak in 2030, they will face many emission reduction pressures. This paper provides a reference for studying the carbon emissions of China’s regional power sectors and their relationship with economic growth and has important implications for peak carbon emissions at the national level.",2019-10-01,10.1007/s11356-019-05909-1,"['Wang, Yong', 'Su, Xuelian', 'Qi, Lin', 'Shang, Peipei', 'Xu, Yonghong']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-019-05909-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

If the postponement constrains intertemporal arbitrage, short-term investments increase but long-term investments are deterred. This effect aggravates the shortage of long-term investments at least partially attributed to firms’ impatience. The cancellation of allowances agreed for Phase IV of the EU ETS is suitable to counteract the negative effects of cap-neutral postponement on long-term investments—by making the reserve redundant.

552,Interval-Parameter Conditional Value-at-Risk Two-Stage Stochastic Programming Model for Management of End-of-Life Vehicles,"The management of end-of-life vehicles conserves natural resources, provides economic benefits, and reduces water, air, and soil pollution. Sound management of end-of-life vehicles is vitally important worldwide thus requiring sophisticated decision-making tools for optimizing its efficiency and reducing system risk. This paper proposes an interval-parameter conditional value-at-risk two-stage stochastic programming model for management of end-of-life vehicles. A case study is conducted in order to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed model. The model is able to provide the trade-offs between the expected profit and system risk. It can effectively control risk at extremely disadvantageous availability levels of end-of-life vehicles. The formulated model can produce optimal solutions under predetermined decision-making risk preferences and confidence levels. It can simultaneously determine the optimal long-term allocation targets of end-of-life vehicles and reusable parts as well as capital investment, production planning, and logistics management decisions within a multi-period planning horizon. The proposed model can efficiently handle uncertainties expressed as interval values and probability distributions. It is able to provide valuable insights into the effects of uncertainties.

554,Scenario analysis of ETS revenue allocation mechanism of China: based on a dynamic CGE model,"The successful establishment of China’s emission trading scheme (ETS) could lead the next generation of global climate carbon markets in industrializing and developing countries. The allocation of ETS revenue from auctioning carbon emission allowance is important for the achievement of China’s joint targets of economic growth, mitigation, and welfare improvement. This study develops a dynamic CGE model to evaluate the effects of different ETS revenue allocation mechanisms and identifies the proper mechanism for China’s ETS design. Ten scenarios including business as usual (BAU), no ETS revenue allocation incentive (NA) and other eight ETS revenue allocation scenarios are designed. Simulation results indicate that the tradeoff between economic cost and environmental benefit exists under different ETS revenue allocation mechanisms. ETS revenue is suggested to allocate to household sector through reducing indirect tax and, after 2020, a certain proportion of ETS revenue could be allocated to production sector for improving energy-saving technology (i.e., STP mechanism). This study provides references for policymakers in China to design effective and realistic ETS-related policies.

555,China’s pre-2020 CO_2 emission reduction potential and its influence,"China achieved the reduction of CO_2 intensity of GDP by 45% compared with 2005 at the end of 2017, realizing the commitment at 2009 Copenhagen Conference on emissions reduction 3 years ahead of time. In future implementation of the “13th Five-Year Plan (FYP),” with the decline of economic growth rate, decrease of energy consumption elasticity and optimization of energy structure, the CO_2 intensity of GDP will still have the potential for decreasing before 2020. By applying KAYA Formula decomposition, this paper makes the historical statistics of the GDP energy intensity decrease and CO_2 intensity of energy consumption since 2005, and simulates the decrease of CO_2 intensity of GDP in 2020 and its influences on achieving National Determined Contribution (NDC) target in 2030 with scenario analysis. The results show that China’s CO_2 intensity of GDP in 2020 is expected to fall by 52.9%–54.4% than the 2005 level, and will be 22.9%–25.4% lower than 2015. Therefore, it is likely to overfulfill the decrease of CO_2 intensity of GDP by 18% proposed in the 13th FYP period. Furthermore, the emission reduction potentiality before 2020 will be conducive to the earlier realization of NDC objectives in 2030. China’s CO_2 intensity of GDP in 2030 will fall by over 70% than that in 2005, and CO_2 emissions peak will appear before 2030 as early as possible. To accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, China needs to make better use of the carbon market, and guide the whole society with carbon price to reduce emissions effectively.

556,The impact of environmental regulation on environmental pollution in China: an empirical study based on the synergistic effect of industrial agglomeration,"In recent years, as environmental degradation has become more and more serious, the Chinese government has formulated a series of environmental policies and regulations aimed at improving environmental quality. Does environmental regulation significantly inhibit environmental pollution? Environmental regulation will not only directly affect environmental pollution but also have an indirect impact on environmental pollution. This paper uses Bayesian posterior probability, the optimal model structure selection method, based on join 112 kinds of spatial econometric model structure, and the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2003 to 2016 to study the effects of environmental regulation on environmental pollution base on the industrial agglomeration mechanism of synergy effect. The research covers the national level and four regions, including the eastern, central, western, and northeastern regions of China. The research shows that: (1) environmental regulation at the national level and in the eastern, central and northeastern regions can significantly curb environmental pollution, but the environmental pollution in the western region shows a significant trend of enhancement. (2) Increased industrial agglomeration across China has significantly worsened environmental pollution. (3) Environmental regulation and industrial agglomeration form a significant synergy effect, which has a significant positive impact on environmental pollution in regions other than northeast China, and a significant negative impact on environmental pollution intensity in northeast China.",2019-09-01,10.1007/s11356-019-05854-z,"['Zhang, Kangkang', 'Xu, Deyi', 'Li, Shiran']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-019-05854-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
557,Review on China’s wind power policy (1986–2017),"As an important renewable energy source, wind power plays a key role in mitigating climate change and has become one of the fastest growing clean energies globally. In China, wind energy development has been a vital component of national energy transformation strategy. Over the years, the Chinese government has introduced a series of policies to promote the development of wind power and also to regulate this emerging industry. Base on examining all the key policy documents on wind power issued by the Chinese government over the last 30 years, we find that China has built up a comprehensive policy system, and summarized the current framework of Chinese wind power policy systematically. Then, we analyze the policy objectives, policy tools, major measures, their results in each development stage, and the characteristics and trends of China’s wind power policies.

558,An environmentally sustainable manufacturing network model under an international ecosystem,"Abstract There is a growing consensus that the increase in greenhouse gases results in unfavorable changes to the Earth’s climate and is responsible for global warming. Due to this ecological imbalance, governments are under growing pressure to enact strict legislation to control these emissions in their respective countries. Consumers also demand eco-friendly products and are moving toward firms that are socially and environmentally responsible. Therefore, industries are facing increased pressure to adopt sustainable production approaches. This paper demonstrates how a mixed integer linear program can be used to optimize the balance of overall cost and carbon emissions in the production, storage, and distribution of products in a regulatory environment that includes a cap and trade policy. The model is computationally tested for fifteen case instances of different sizes. The main contributions of the proposed model are (a) to link the emission parameters to various decision variables to support the decision making related to carbon costs and carbon emissions, (b) to address international trade issues by considering international parameters such as imports, exports, and government subsidies and perform a country-specific analysis for carbon emissions, and (c) to identify the extent to which the operational adjustment can be used as an alternative to the costly investment in carbon reduction technologies to reduce emissions.

559,Evidence on Whether Banks Consider Carbon Risk in Their Lending Decisions,"Banks face a dilemma in choosing between maximising profits and facilitating the sustainable use of resources within a carbon-constrained future. This study provides empirical evidence on this dilemma, investigating whether a bank loan announcement for a firm with high carbon risk conveys information to investors about the firm’s carbon risk exposure collected through a bank’s pre-loan screening and ongoing monitoring. We use a sample of 120 bank loan announcements for ASX-listed firms over the period 2009–2015. We measure high (low) carbon risk exposure based on whether firms meet (do not meet) the reporting threshold of the NGER scheme. We document positive and significant excess loan announcement returns for loan renewals for high carbon risk firms, but not for loan initiations. Further, we document a more significant loan announcement return for renewals with favourable term revisions. Finally, we find no evidence that the market differentiates between domestic and foreign lenders. Taken together, our results suggest that investors perceive that banks incorporate carbon risk considerations into their lending decisions. Our results highlight the value of banks as financial intermediaries given the information asymmetry surrounding firms’ carbon risk exposure, and more generally the need to extend modern banking theory to consider issues such as the impact of banks’ CSR reputation on lending decisions.",2019-08-15,10.1007/s10551-017-3711-3,"['Herbohn, Kathleen', 'Gao, Ru', 'Clarkson, Peter']",Journal of Business Ethics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10551-017-3711-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

We use a panel data model for MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Turkey) countries in the period 1990–2013 and an empirical framework based on the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH). Using the fully modified least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) econometric methodologies, the empirical results confirm an inverted-U relationship between FDI and the ecological footprint. To reinforce our analysis, we check the connection between economic growth and the ecological footprint, validating the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for MINT countries. Finally, we also confirm a negative connection between renewable energy use, the urbanization process, and the changes in the ecological footprint. These findings offer a series of useful recommendations for policymakers, where the promotion of clean industries and energy-efficiency actions are essential for reducing environmental damage in MINT countries.

561,Does economic policy uncertainty matter for carbon emission? Evidence from US sector level data,"Economic policy uncertainty (EPU) will affect the external business environment of economic entities, which in turn affects the decision-making of economic entities. Meanwhile, carbon emissions are closely related to the production decisions of microeconomic entities. Thus, studying the relationship between EPU and carbon emissions helps to clarify the impact of institutional factors behind carbon emissions, which is significant for achieving green development. Based on US sector data, we apply a novel parametric test of Granger causality in quantiles to analyze the relationship between EPU and carbon emissions (its growth and uncertainty). We find that there is an outstanding pattern of Granger-causality from the US EPU to the growth of carbon emissions in the tails of the growth distributions of carbon emissions in the industrial sector, residential sector, electric power sector, and transportation sector, except in the commercial sector. That is, carbon emissions are affected by EPU when the growth of carbon emissions is in a higher or lower growth period. Lastly, we find that the US EPU affects carbon emissions uncertainty over the entire conditional distribution for all sectors.",2019-08-01,10.1007/s11356-019-05627-8,"['Jiang, Yong', 'Zhou, Zhongbao', 'Liu, Cenjie']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-019-05627-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
562,Evolutionary game analysis for third-party governance of environmental pollution,"Environmental pollution in China presents complex features include regional, agglomeration, periodicity, diversity and multiple. The government-led environmental pollution control mode has been unable to adapt to the current grim situation, so the inevitable trend of the development of Chinese environmental pollution governance system is the third-party governance with diversified participation. The tripartite evolutionary game model is built, including the governments, environmental services companies and pollutant discharging enterprise, and the key factors affecting the dynamic evolution of game equilibrium are explored. Then, the effects of third-party governance punishment strategy of environmental pollution under multiple scenarios and the stable equilibrium points are also discussed. Results are show as follow: (1) the “public-private-partnership” mode is the key point to increase the environmental public interest in the process of achieving economic benefits; (2) The government can not only take punishment as the main regulatory measures, but also need to establish a contractual “public and private” governance system. At the same time, government should establish governance authority and fulfill the roles and responsibilities of the coordinator, guider and supervisor; (3) the implementation of government supervision must be combined with Chinese economic and society development and environmental pollution, and guided by marketization, legalization, specialization, and industrialization. According to the degree of perfection of the system of third-party governance of environmental pollution, the penalties for illegal actions are dynamically adjusted in time.

Further, we seek to gain insights from climate change programs and strategies of both superior and inferior sustainability performers. Adopting mixed methods, we use a merged sample from the Top500 world’s largest firms and the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations. Our quantitative analyses show that greater awareness of physical and other climate change opportunities is what sets superior performers apart, and that superior future sustainability performance is related to a firm’s stated awareness of these two types of opportunities. Qualitative content analysis of narrative disclosures confirm that superior performers provide more detailed description of climate change strategies that go beyond managing climate change risks.

564,On selecting directions for directional distance functions in a non-parametric framework: a review,"Directional distance function (DDF) has been a commonly used technique for estimating efficiency and productivity over the past two decades, and the directional vector is usually predetermined in the applications of DDF. The most critical issue of using DDF remains that how to appropriately project the inefficient decision-making unit onto the production frontier along with a justified direction. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on the techniques for selecting directional vector of the directional distance function. It begins with a brief introduction of the existing methods around the inclusion of the exogenous direction techniques and the endogenous direction techniques. The former commonly includes arbitrary direction and conditional direction techniques, while the latter involves the techniques for seeking theoretically optimized directions (i.e., direction towards the closest benchmark or indicating the largest efficiency improvement potential) and market-oriented directions (i.e., directions towards cost minimization, profit maximization, or marginal profit maximization benchmarks). The main advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are summarized, and the limitations inherent in the exogenous direction-selecting techniques are discussed. It also analytically argues the mechanism of each endogenous direction technique. The literature review is end up with a numerical example of efficiency estimation for power plants, in which most of the reviewed directions for DDF are demonstrated and their evaluation performance are compared.",2019-07-15,10.1007/s10479-017-2423-5,"['Wang, Ke', 'Xian, Yujiao', 'Lee, Chia-Yen', 'Wei, Yi-Ming', 'Huang, Zhimin']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-017-2423-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

566,Technology adoption with carbon emission trading mechanism: modeling with heterogeneous agents and uncertain carbon price,"The adoption of new technologies with high efficiency and low emissions is of great importance in achieving sustainable development. Most studies of technology adoption have been criticized for idealistically assuming only one global decision agent. In this paper, an optimization model of technology adoption with heterogeneous agents is proposed. These agents have different market shares, and each one attempts to identify the optimal technology adoption for a portion of the entire system. The carbon emission trading mechanism is implemented to reduce carbon emissions. Agents’ acceptance of uncertain carbon prices is characterized by calculating their willingness to pay, and a bargaining process is introduced to reasonably allocate the profit. Computational tests are conducted with different market shares and different discounting factors. Numerical results show that implementing the carbon emission trading mechanism is an effective way to promote technology adoption and carbon emission reduction, although it does not certainly lead to less carbon emissions than implementing only a carbon cap. A small gap between agents’ market shares and an increase in the seller’s discounting factor will lead to more adoption in the entire system. A seller’s market may lead to less carbon emissions than implementing only a carbon cap, while a buyer’s market may lead to more carbon emissions. Moreover, it is suggested that governments can propose incentive policies to support small companies to develop and maintain carbon prices at a reasonable level to benefit sellers to promote technology adoption.",2019-06-17,10.1007/s10479-019-03297-w,"['Fang, Chenhao', 'Ma, Tieju']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-019-03297-w,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
567,The impact of different GHG reduction scenarios on the economy and social welfare of Thailand using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model,"Background The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Thailand intends to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20 to 25% from the projected business as usual level by 2030 with the deployment of renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency improvement measures in both the supply and demand sectors. However, in order to contribute towards meeting the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement to stay well below 2 °C, ambitious mitigation efforts beyond 2030 are needed. As such, it is necessary to assess the effects of imposing more stringent long-term GHG reduction targets in Thailand beyond the NDC commitment. Methods This paper analyses the macroeconomic effects of limiting the GHG emissions by using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model on Thailand’s economy during 2010 to 2050. Besides the business as usual (BAU) scenario, this study assesses the macroeconomic effects of ten low to medium GHG mitigation scenarios under varying GHG reduction targets of 20 to 50%. In addition, this study also assesses three different peak emission scenarios, each targeting a GHG reduction of up to 90% by 2050, to analyze the feasibility of zero GHG emissions in Thailand to pursue efforts to hold the global temperature rise to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, as considered in the Paris Agreement. Results According to the BAU scenario, the GHG emissions from the electricity, industry, and transport sectors would remain the most prominent throughout the planning period. The modeling results indicate that the medium to peak emission reduction scenarios could result in a serious GDP loss compared to the BAU scenario, and therefore, the attainment of such mitigation targets could be very challenging for Thailand. Results suggest that the development and deployment of energy-efficient and renewable energy-based technologies would play a significant role not only in minimizing the GHG emissions but also for overcoming the macroeconomic loss and lowering the price of GHG emissions. Conclusions The results reveal that without a transformative change in the economic structure and energy system of Thailand, the country would have to face enormous cost in reducing its GHG emissions.",2019-06-03,10.1186/s13705-019-0200-9,"['Rajbhandari, Salony', 'Limmeechokchai, Bundit', 'Masui, Toshihiko']","Energy, Sustainability and Society",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13705-019-0200-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
568,Reducing greenhouse gas emissions: a duopoly market pricing competition and cooperation under the carbon emissions cap,"This article studies the price competition and cooperation in a duopoly that is subjected to carbon emissions cap. The study assumes that in a departure from the classical Bertrand game, there is still a market for both firms’ goods regardless of the product price, even though production capacity is limited by carbon emissions regulation. Through the decentralized decision making of both firms under perfect information, the results are unstable. The firm with the lower maximum production capacity under carbon emissions regulation and the firm with the higher maximum production capacity both seek market price cooperation. By designing an internal carbon credits trading mechanism, we can ensure that the production capacity of the firm with the higher maximum production capacity under carbon emissions regulation reaches price equilibrium. Also, the negotiation power of the duopoly would affect the price equilibrium.",2019-06-01,10.1007/s11356-017-8767-1,"['Jian, Ming', 'He, Hua', 'Ma, Changsong', 'Wu, Yan', 'Yang, Hao']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-017-8767-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
569,California's success in the socio-ecological practice of a forest carbon offset credit option to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions,"The mitigation of climate change through the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has become a central goal of international policy. An estimated 27 cap-and-trade programs to reduce carbon emissions exist worldwide. But only a small number of them use a forest carbon offset credit option. In 2012, California created a forest carbon offset credit option as part of its greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program. The offset credits have come primarily from US forests that meet requirements for additional, verifiable increases in carbon storage through improved forest management. California, with the help of its cap-and-trade program and modest carbon offset option, has met its initial goal for lower carbon emissions. This case study reveals a gap in socio-ecological practice research on a forest carbon offset credit option by identifying seven measures of success. These seven measures show how a forest carbon offset credit option can enhance a cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Countries and regions that are using or contemplating the use of a forest carbon offset credit option can employ these seven measures to design, evaluate, or upgrade their forest carbon offset programs.",2019-06-01,10.1007/s42532-019-00017-3,"['Kim, Chaeri', 'Daniels, Thomas']",Socio-Ecological Practice Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s42532-019-00017-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
570,Decomposition of Cameroon’s CO_2 emissions from 2007 to 2014: an extended Kaya identity,"To effectively combat global warming, an enormous reduction in CO_2 emissions is required. Cameroon, which is currently the largest emitter of CO_2 in the CEMAC subregion, has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2035. However, previous studies in Cameroon have only addressed the relationship between economic growth, energy consumption, and CO_2 emissions without estimating all causal relationships at the same time. Moreover, no study has yet decomposed this country’s CO_2 emissions to date. To fill these research gaps and further assess the determinants of these CO_2 emissions, an extended Kaya identity and the Logarithm Mean Divisia Index (LMDI I) have been applied in this paper to identify, quantify, and explain the main drivers of Cameroon’s CO_2 emissions from 2007 to 2014. Seven effects were measured and the main findings show that carbon intensity and the emission factor increased by 0.57% and 107.50% respectively. Regarding contributions to the increase of CO_2 emissions, the population effect was the most positive followed by the activity effect, whereas the energy intensity, the substitution of fossil fuels and the penetration of renewable energies have contributed to reduce the CO_2 emission. To enable Cameroon to not only achieve the goals of its vision but also develop a low-carbon economy, this paper provides some proposed avenues that should be considered by policymakers.",2019-06-01,10.1007/s11356-019-05042-z,"['Engo, Jean']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-019-05042-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

This review analyzes current knowledge gaps, challenges, and opportunities in the industrial application of straw biochar returning. Biochar standards, the quantitative and qualitative analysis methods for biochar, and high-value-added products that are based on biochar are critically examined with goal of providing recommendations for future studies. We propose production and modification of biochar that is application oriented to enhance its fitness for purpose as well as long-term and large-space–scale field study to better understand its impact on soil properties and ecotoxicology.

572,The EU-China relationship in a new era of global climate governance,"Global climate governance still faces serious challenges despite the epochal Paris Agreement of 2015. Whether and how the world will reach the targeted 1.5-degree limit remains difficult to foresee, although undoubtedly one of the necessary conditions is greater cooperation among the major greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting nations. In this light, the decision by the USA, the second largest GHG emitter in the world, to withdraw from the Paris Agreement has significant global ramifications. Another source of uncertainty is the European Union’s climate policy, which has long been a role model for the world; it will likely have to undergo major changes as a result of the UK’s exit from the EU, which is projected to take place in 2019. Against this backdrop of profound geopolitical changes, this article argues that strengthened cooperation between the EU and China—the world’s largest GHG emitter, but also its largest investor in renewable energy and an increasingly vocal voice for climate action—is indispensable for meaningful climate change mitigation and adaptation in the decades ahead, even if the end results still fall short of the ambitions outlined in the Paris Agreement. Diverging economic and political interests still exist, but there is also much common interest and ample room for collaboration.

573,The efficiency of carbon trading market in China: evidence from variance ratio tests,"On December 19, 2017, China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced the official launch of the much-anticipated national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a critical period for the transition from the eight carbon emission trading pilot projects to the national market at this stage. Comprehensively evaluating the efficiency of China’s eight carbon trading pilots is vital for strengthening the construction of its national ETS. This paper investigates the weak-form efficiency of eight carbon trading markets in China. We use a series of variance ratio tests to identify the efficiency from the market set up to the May 4, 2018, of all markets. The results indicate that the majority of the carbon trading markets are inefficient and only Beijing, Hubei, and Fujian markets are efficient. The China’s carbon trading market is gradually maturing and implemented. In addition, we analyze the factors have impact on the market efficiency. It shows that the liquidity, volume, allocation allowance, and transparency in information are significant factors; meanwhile, the regional policy and cross cooperation also are important factors. Finally, this paper puts forward several policy recommendations on how to strengthen the effectiveness of China carbon trading markets based on the empirical results.",2019-05-01,10.1007/s11356-019-04778-y,"['Zhou, Jianguo', 'Huo, Xuejing', 'Jin, Baoling', 'Yu, Xuechao']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-019-04778-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
574,Grey Water Footprint Assessment from the Perspective of Water Pollution Sources: A Case Study of China,"Abstract With the acceleration of industrialization and urbanization, the water crisis is becoming more severe and may threaten the future of sustainable development. Assessing grey water footprint (GWF) is a useful step in the prevention and control of water pollution. Conventional studies have only considered agricultural pollutants in their calculations of GWF, ignoring the roles of industrial and household wastewater. Therefore, this study calculates GWFs for the agricultural, industrial, and household sectors in 31 provinces in China from 1998 to 2012. It further analyzes spatial and temporal variations in China’s GWF. The results show that total GWF (TGWF) was relatively high from 1998 to 2002, then increased steadily and peaked in 2006, and dramatically decreased after 2006. Overall, TGWF slightly decreased over the study period. 31 Provinces were divided into five grades of TGWF: very high, high, medium, low, and very low. The provinces with high or very high TGWF, such as Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, were primarily located in southeastern and southwestern China. Therefore, efforts to reduce GWF should focus on these regions. Our comparative study also provides a means of understanding how key contributors to GWF vary across the five regions. It offers a basis for the short-term and long-term development policies aimed at decreasing GWF in specific locations.",2019-05-01,10.1134/S0097807819030187,"['Xionghe Qin', 'Sun, Caizhi', 'Han, Qin', 'Zou, Wei']",Water Resources,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1134/S0097807819030187,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
575,"Energy efficiency, carbon dioxide emission efficiency, and related abatement costs in regional China: a synthesis of input–output analysis and DEA","This paper attempts to examine energy efficiency, carbon dioxide (CO_2) emission efficiency, and related abatement costs of China’s regions in 2012 by considering embodied carbon caused by trade. To this end, a combined approach with environmentally extended input–output analysis (EEIO) and DEA is proposed. We first apply the EEIO model to measure CO_2 emissions of 30 China’s regions from the consumption perspective, which can identify the described embodied carbon. According to the amounts of CO_2 emissions with respect to the production-based and consumption-based principles, 30 regions are divided into two groups, i.e., emission-importing regions and emission-exporting regions. For emission-importing regions, CO_2 emissions from the consumption perspective exceed that from the production-based perspective. The emission-exporting regions exhibit the opposite case. Our results show that energy efficiency and CO_2 emission abatement costs will be underestimated in both groups when ignoring the embodied carbon emissions. The emission-importing regions evidence higher efficiency scores and abatement costs than those emission-exporting regions, and there is a significant difference between these two groups in terms of energy efficiency and CO_2 emission efficiency, whereas there is no significant difference with respect to CO_2 emission abatement costs. It is interesting that emission-exporting regions enjoy a slight increase in CO_2 emission efficiency whereas emission-importing regions suffer from a decrease. Some useful policy implications are achieved.",2019-04-02,10.1007/s12053-018-9695-8,"['Cheng, Yu', 'Lv, Kangjuan', 'Wang, Jian', 'Xu, Hao']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12053-018-9695-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
576,The Convergence of China’s Marginal Abatement Cost of CO_2: An Emission-Weighted Continuous State Space Approach,This paper develops a weighted continuous state space approach to convergence analysis and makes a first empirical attempt at examining the heterogeneity and convergence of China’s marginal abatement cost (MAC) of CO_2 using a dataset of 286 cities during the years 2002–2013. The results show clear patterns of convergence in China’s MAC but substantial heterogeneity remains in the long run. Both joint and conditional emission-weighted distributions suggest less heterogeneity in abatement cost but greater potential for low-cost abatement opportunities than it appears in the commonly-presented unweighted distributions. The findings provide strong scientific support for China to take more proactive and aggressive measures to mitigate CO_2 emissions.,2019-04-01,10.1007/s10640-018-0240-1,"['Wu, Jianxin', 'Ma, Chunbo']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-018-0240-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
577,"Adult Verbal Comprehension Performance is Better from Human Speakers than Social Robots, but only for Easy Questions","The present study examined whether any differences existed in verbal comprehension performance when information was communicated through either a human or a robot speaker, and whether the nonverbal communication of either a “high social” robot (i.e., frequent gestures, direct head gaze) or a “low social” robot (i.e., no gestures, indirect head gaze) influenced comprehension. This study also assessed whether question difficulty moderated comprehension performance. A sample of 46 adult participants (23 human + high social robot; 23 human + low social robot) were given verbal comprehension questions from both a human and a robot. The results showed that, as question difficulty increased, performance elicited by the robot speaker reached parity with that of the human speaker. Conversely, for easy questions, performance generated from the robot speaker was significantly inferior to that from the human speaker. The robot social level of behaviour had no measurable impact on the results. These results suggest that the traditional use of social robots for simple communications could be extended to more complex domains.

578,Shear strength behavior and parameters of microbial gellan gum-treated soils: from sand to clay,"Microbial biopolymers have recently been introduced as a new material for soil treatment and improvement. Biopolymers provide significant strengthening to soil, even in small quantities (i.e., at 1/10th or less of the required amount of conventional binders, such as cement). In particular, thermo-gelating biopolymers, including agar gum, gellan gum, and xanthan gum, are known to strengthen soils noticeably, even under water-saturated conditions. However, an explicitly detailed examination of the microscopic interactions and strengthening characteristics between gellan gum and soil particles has not yet been performed. In this study, a series of laboratory experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of soil–gellan gum interactions on the strengthening behavior of gellan gum-treated soil mixtures (from sand to clay). The experimental results showed that the strengths of sand–clay mixtures were effectively increased by gellan gum treatment over those of pure sand or clay. The strengthening behavior is attributed to the conglomeration of fine particles as well as to the interconnection of fine and coarse particles, by gellan gum. Gellan gum treatment significantly improved not only inter-particle cohesion but also the friction angle of clay-containing soils.",2019-04-01,10.1007/s11440-018-0641-x,"['Chang, Ilhan', 'Cho, Gye-Chun']",Acta Geotechnica,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11440-018-0641-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
579,South Carolina forestland owners’ willingness to accept compensations for carbon sequestration,"Background Carbon sequestration through recommended forest management practices is an ecosystem service that helps mitigate climate change and its impacts while generating carbon credits for forestland owners to sell in cap-and-trade programs. The California’s cap-and-trade program (California’s carbon market hereafter) allows forestland owners from any part of the contiguous United States to supply carbon credits to compliance entities. In this study, we estimate South Carolina (SC) private forestland owners’ willingness to accept compensations to participate in the California’s carbon market using a contingent valuation method. Results We estimate forestland owners’ mean willingness to accept as $67 per acre per year. Our results reveal higher probability of participation of forestland owners with interests in preserving forest ecosystems than those who do not. Additionally, forestland owners who trust in information about climate change from scientists or government are willing to participate more than those who do not. Conclusions Various factors hinder landowners’ ability to participate in carbon markets. Forestland owners in SC consider legislative uncertainty and long-time commitment as the main barriers to participation in California’s carbon market. From this research, average forestland tenure in SC is 27 years, which is far less than the 100-year time commitment of the California’s carbon market. Of those who agreed to participate, choosing between adopting and not adopting any of the three main forest management practices in the California’s carbon market: 28% are likely to adopt improved forest management (IFM) practices, 24% are likely to adopt reforestation due to understocked forestlands, and 14% are likely to adopt avoided conversion. In another development, the concept of aggregation has dominated discussions in the California’s carbon market of late. It is an advocacy to include small-scale forestlands in the California’s carbon market. To aggregate, different forestland owners will combine their forestlands to participate. We find that 79% of SC forestland owners are willing to aggregate to participate. However, this research is unable to determine how much total forestland is available in SC for carbon market. We recommend future research in the State on forestland owners’ participation in carbon market should consider evaluating forestland availability.",2019-03-25,10.1186/s40663-019-0175-1,"['Alhassan, Mustapha', 'Motallebi, Marzieh', 'Song, Bo']",Forest Ecosystems,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40663-019-0175-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

581,A scientometric review of biochar research in the past 20 years (1998–2018),"Biochar is the carbon-rich product obtained from the thermochemical conversion of biomass under oxygen-limited conditions. Biochar has attained extensive attention due to its agronomical and environmental benefits in agro-ecosystems. This work adopts the scientometric analysis method to assess the development trends of biochar research based on the literature data retrieved from the Web of Science over the period of 1998–2018. By analysing the basic characteristics of 6934 publications, we found that the number of publications grew rapidly since 2010. Based on a keyword analysis, it is concluded that scholars have had a fundamental recognition of biochar and preliminarily found that biochar application had agronomic and environmental benefits during the period of 1998–2010. The clustering results of keywords in documents published during 2011–2015 showed that the main research hotspots were “biochar production”, “biochar and global climate change”, “soil quality and plant growth”, “organic pollutants removal”, and “heavy metals immobilization”. While in 2016–2018, beside these five main research hotspots, “biochar and composting” topic had also received greater attention, indicating that biochar utilization in organic solid waste composting is the current research hotspot. Moreover, updated reactors (e.g., microwave reactor, fixed-bed reactor, screw-feeding reactor, bubbling fluidized bed reactor, etc.) or technologies (e.g., solar pyrolysis, Thermo-Catalytic Reforming process, liquefaction technology, etc.) applied for efficient energy production and modified biochar for environmental remediation have been extensively studied recently.

This study aims to provide an analysis of the ambitiousness and fairness of the mitigation components of the INDCs submitted by various parties. We use a unified framework to assess 23 INDCs that cover 50 countries, including European Union (EU)-28 countries as parties to the Convention, which represent 87.45% of the global greenhouse gas emissions in 2012. First, we transform initial INDC files into reported reduction targets. Second, we create four schemes and six scenarios to determine the required reduction effort, which considers each nation’s reduction responsibility, capacity, and potential, thereby reflecting their historical and current development status. Finally, we combine the reported reduction target and the required reduction effort to assess INDCs. Evaluation results of the 23 emitters indicate that 2 emitters (i.e., EU and Brazil) are rated as “sufficient,” 7 emitters (e.g., China, the United States, and Canada) are rated as “moderate,” and 14 emitters (e.g., India, Russia, and Japan) are rated as “insufficient.” Most pledges exhibit a considerable distance from representing a fair contribution.",2019-03-01,10.1007/s42524-019-0007-6,"['Gao, Ge', 'Chen, Mo', 'Wang, Jiayu', 'Yang, Kexin', 'Xian, Yujiao', 'Shi, Xunpeng', 'Wang, Ke']",Frontiers of Engineering Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s42524-019-0007-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

584,"Financing climate-resilient infrastructure: Determining risk, reward, and return on investment","Urban infrastructure investment is needed for both, mitigation of climate risks and improved urban resiliency. Financing them requires the translation of those benefits into measurable returns on investment in the context of emerging risks that capital markets can understand and appreciate. This paper develops a generic framework to identify what are the necessary and sufficient factors to economically favor climate-change resilient infrastructure in private investment decisions. We specifically demonstrate that carbon pricing alone will not generate the needed will, because market prices at present systematically fail to account for climate change risks such as the costs of stranded assets and the national and local co-benefits of investments in climate resiliency. Carbon pricing is necessary, but not sufficient for an enhanced private financing of climate-resilient infrastructure.

585,"The dynamic linkage between renewable energy, tourism, CO_2 emissions, economic growth, foreign direct investment, and trade","Because of the lack of econometric studies in relevance to the link between tourism and renewable energy, the goal of this study is to remedy this lack and to explore the causal relationships between renewable energy consumption, the number of tourist arrivals, the trade openness ratio, economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI), and carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions for a panel of 22 Central and South American countries, spanning the period 1995–2010. The empirical findings document that the variables under investigation are cointegrated. Short-run Granger causality tests illustrate unidirectional causalities running from: (i) renewable energy to CO_2 emissions and trade; (ii) tourism to trade and FDI; and (iii) economic growth to renewable energy and tourism. In the long run, there is evidence of bidirectional causality between renewable energy, tourism, FDI, trade, and emissions. Thus, renewable energy and tourism are in a strong long-run causal relationship. Moreover, long-run estimates for the whole panel and for the three income panel groups considered (Lower Middle, Upper Middle, High) highlight that tourism, renewable energy, and FDI contribute to the reduction of emissions, while trade and economic growth lead to higher carbon emissions. Therefore, attracting foreign direct investment, encouraging the use of renewable energy, and tourism development, particularly green tourism, are good policies for this region to combat climate change.",2019-02-19,10.1186/s40503-019-0063-7,"['Ben Jebli, Mehdi', 'Ben Youssef, Slim', 'Apergis, Nicholas']",Latin American Economic Review,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40503-019-0063-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
586,"Moderating and mediating role of renewable energy consumption, FDI inflows, and economic growth on carbon dioxide emissions: evidence from robust least square estimator","The relationship between renewable energy consumption (REC), foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, economic growth, and their resulting impact on CO2 emissions is widely discussed area in energy and environmental literature; however, there is an unseen literature on moderation and mediation effect of per capita income and FDI inflows with the renewable energy consumption on CO2 emissions in developing countries like Pakistan, which is being evaluated in this study by using a consistent time series data for a period of 1975–2016. The results show that economic growth and FDI inflows both increase CO2 emissions, while REC substantially decreases CO2 emissions during the study time period. The results do not support the inverted U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for per capita income (and FDI inflows) and per capita CO2 emissions in a country. The results supported ‘pollution haven hypothesis’ where FDI inflows damage the natural flora of the country. By inclusion of moderation and mediation effect of per capita income and FDI inflows with the REC on CO2 emissions averted the positive impact of REC, and converted into negative externality, where environmental sustainability agenda is compromised by lower environmental regulations and unsustainable production techniques that increase country’s economic growth. The study concludes that by adding REC in existing energy portfolio may help to reduce CO2 emissions while strict environmental compliance may disregard the negative externality of unsustainable production and it will support to achieve green development programmes in a country.",2019-01-30,10.1007/s11356-018-3837-6,"['Naz, Saiqa', 'Sultan, Rashida', 'Zaman, Khalid', 'Aldakhil, Abdullah Mohammed', 'Nassani, Abdelmohsen A.', 'Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-018-3837-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
587,Assessment of equity principles for international climate policy based on an integrated assessment model,"Defining an internationally equitable distribution of the burdens of reducing greenhouse gases has been one of core concerns for as long as climate policies have been debated. This paper suggests the specific formulae and indicators for four equity principles for international climate policy including the ability to pay, egalitarianism, grandfathering, and historical responsibility. We introduce the carbon trading scheme into the integrated assessment model to assess and compare the global climate policies which are based on the four principles. To be specific, the regional emission caps are determined by the four equity principles, and all regions are allowed to buy and sell permits. Results show that none of the four equity principles creates a burden sharing arrangement that completely equalizes the benefits of each nation. To be specific, grandfathering is more beneficial to developed countries, while historical responsibility benefits developing countries more. From the global perspective, the global cumulative output of the grandfathering is 8% higher than that of the historical responsibility. In addition, international cooperation on climate change mitigation is necessary, because if individual nations undertake policies which are in their national self-interests, global cumulative CO_2 emission will be over two times as much as that in cooperative scenarios.",2019-01-15,10.1007/s11069-018-3408-7,"['Mi, Zhifu', 'Liao, Hua', 'Coffman, D’Maris', 'Wei, Yi-Ming']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-018-3408-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
588,Can Chinese residential low-carbon consumption behavior intention be better explained? The role of cultural values,"For better implementation of emission reduction policies in China, this paper focuses on households, one of the major sources of carbon emission, and look into the forming mechanism of residential low-carbon consumption behavioral intention in China. Chinese cultural values (man-to-nature orientation values and collectivism values) are added to Theory of Planned Behavior model to better explain the residential low-carbon consumption behavioral intention in China, and to look into the specific role of cultural values in the model. Through the analysis on 948 samples from Jiangsu by using Mplus7.0, we found that: The original Theory of Planned Behavior model was verified, namely attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control had significant positive direct effect on low-carbon consumption behavioral intention. In the extended model, man-to-nature orientation values did not have significant direct effect on low-carbon consumption behavioral intention, but collectivism values had significant direct positive effect; both kinds of values were proved to have positive moderating effect on the influence of low-carbon consumption behavioral attitude on low-carbon consumption behavioral intention, but their regulating effect on the influence of subjective norms or perceived behavioral control on low-carbon consumption behavioral intention was not significant. After considering the effect of cultural values, the model’s explanatory power rose from 76.7 to 79.3% (moderated by collectivism values) and 81.1% (moderated by man-to-nature orientation values), suggesting a better explanation for the Chinese residents’ low-carbon consumption behavioral intention has been made. In the end, discussion for results was made and implications were proposed.",2019-01-15,10.1007/s11069-018-3461-2,"['Jiang, Xin', 'Ding, Zhihua', 'Liu, Rong']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-018-3461-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
589,Effect of corporate social responsibility on corporate tax avoidance: evidence from a matching approach,"The literature provides various theories relating to the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and tax avoidance. If firms view both CSR activities and tax payments as paths toward contributing to society, CSR and tax avoidance activities exhibit a negative relationship. Conversely, the two activities exhibit a positive relationship if firms engage in CSR for the purpose of risk management. This study examines the effect of CSR on corporate tax avoidance using a matching approach. Three matching algorithms, namely nearest neighbor, radius, and kernel algorithms, are used to match the two groups of firms (CSR and non-CSR firms) in order to correct for sample selection bias. This study adopts Chinese listed firms during 2009–2016 as a research sample. Most empirical results show that CSR firms have higher book-tax differences and lower effective tax rates. This indicates that CSR firms are more aggressive in their tax avoidance. These findings imply that firms engage in CSR activities as a risk management strategy.",2019-01-15,10.1007/s11135-018-0722-9,"['Mao, Chih-Wen']",Quality & Quantity,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11135-018-0722-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

592,Environmental Impacts in Relation to Wind Energy,"The environmental impacts irrespective of the energy source can range from extremely deleterious to acceptable minimum levels. In the case of fossil power generation, impacts could be extremely harmful in terms of long-term human health hazards. In the case of renewable energies such as solar and wind, the effect on health can be of acceptable levels, whereas in the case of biomass and bioenergy, it can be a minimax depending upon the surrounding environmental areas. For example, if farm products, located in sparsely populated areas with low-density development, are used for power generation, depending upon the level of carbon emissions, these could be acceptable for interim power generation. Thus, in addition to large scale, medium scale, or small scale of operation, consideration of the location where the generation takes place is important.

In response to global warming, cap-and-trade policy is adopted by governments in many countries as the most effective carbon emission regulation policy. The paper investigates the pricing and carbon reduction mode of a two echelon supply chain consisting of a supplier and a prefabricated building manufacturer. The prefabricated building manufacturer decides the retail price and unit carbon emissions under cap-and-trade policy. The supplier decides the wholesale price and unit carbon emissions of the materials. They can reduce carbon emissions independently or jointly. We derived the optimal policies of the supplier and the prefabricated building manufacturer in independent carbon reduction mode and joint carbon reduction mode, respectively. We also show that joint carbon reduction mode makes the supplier and the manufacturer input more effort to cut carbon emissions. Finally, we analyze the effect of carbon reduction mode on the optimal decisions and the profit of the supplier, the prefabricated building manufacturer and the supply chain by a numerical study.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-93351-1_111,"['Jiang, Wen', 'Wu, Lanjun', 'Zhou, Ying']",Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Management Science and Engineering Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-93351-1_111,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Development is inseparable from finance, and green transformation development is also inseparable from finance. What green transition development needs is green finance. Green finance, in short, refers to the finance used to support production and consumption activities such as resource conservation, environmental friendliness and ecological conservation.

609,Carbon Management Planning in UK Universities: A Journey to Low Carbon Built Environment,"Climate change and increasing carbon emissions are the biggest challenges for the modern world. Organisations are facing increasing pressure from governments and stakeholders to reduce carbon emissions. The Higher Education (HE) sector has a huge environmental, social and economic impact. In 2012–13, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) consumed 7.9 billion kWh of energy and emitted 2.3 million tonnes of carbon emissions, which strengthens the role of universities in implementing carbon management for a low carbon built environment. The HE sector is not exempt from implementing carbon management strategies and respond to the UK government’s Climate Change Act by developing its own targets in England, which are in line with the national targets—80% reduction by 2050 and 34% by 2020 from the 1990 baseline. This indicates the scale of the challenge to implement carbon management through effective planning procedures. The aim of this paper is to explore the key elements of the carbon management planning process in UK universities and identify potential areas of improvements. This exploratory study adopted a qualitative and inductive research approach. The data were collected through the content analysis of eighteen universities’ carbon management plans (CMPs). The study found that key elements of carbon management planning are senior management leadership, carbon footprinting, carbon reduction targets, stakeholder engagement, funding and resources, governance and evaluation and reporting. Universities have shown policy commitment and developed CMPs for implementation, but the performance of universities varies significantly. There is also a disconnect between planning and delivery. The findings of this research show that CMPs can be valuable tools to assist universities in their carbon management journey. However, weaknesses are identified in the current design of CMPs, for example, overly focusing on the technical issues of carbon management (to the detriment of socio-technical factors), unsupportive of stakeholder engagement, not aligned with core policies and strategies and being static documents.

612,Ensuring Industrial Competitiveness with a Unified European Approach to Sustainable Energy,"German energy-intensive and highrevenue companies are postponing investments due to energy policies and the regulatory framework. Although this applies only to a number of companies, it shows that rising costs and uncertainty about the future energy policy agenda influence companies’ decisions to invest. But only a few companies are planning to intensify foreign investments for these reasons. However, the present rules installed to prevent carbon leakage are limited in time and are in danger of becoming modified particularly at the expense of energy-intensive companies. Such uncertainties and unilateral strains that are restricted to Germany or Europe are a threat to innovations and the necessary investments which industries here need to make for low carbon and more efficient production. In order to achieve the energy transformation targets, there is a need for efficient measures that limit total expenditures as far as possible and prevent domestic companies from unilateral cost burdens.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-03374-3_15,"['Bardt, Hubertus', 'Schaefer, Thilo']",The European Dimension of Germany’s Energy Transition,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-03374-3_15,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
613,Green Finance in Indonesia,"Indonesia’s population growth, urbanization, and economic growth are driving growing energy demand, and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Although abundant in renewable energy resources, the country’s economy and energy security is largely reliant on fossil fuels, with coal and gas generators risking asset stranding in a rapidly decarbonizing world. The government has pursued policy reform to support GHG reductions and accelerate the adoption of renewable energy. However, unclear incentives, historical subsidies, inconsistent policies, and concentrated monopoly structures that obscure cost transparency, are hampering the achievement of its targets. Under the current business-as-usual trajectory, increasing emissions and other associated climate impacts present a range of socioeconomic risks. Although studies indicate that it is technically feasible for Indonesia to undertake an affordable green transformation without jeopardizing economic growth and poverty reduction, there exists a large gap in financing. Increased investment from both private and public sectors is needed, as public funds alone are insufficient. This chapter identifies the market, policy, and governance barriers—including financial credit regulations, uncompetitive pricing, restrictive project scale, and limited access to information—to unlocking green financing for a low-carbon energy transition. We propose reform pathways via the development of mechanisms for market transparency that include the need for a wholesale electricity market and low emissions and renewable investments using tradable certificate-based policies (in particular CO_2 credits), harmonization of policies across ministries and agencies, and a reduction of electricity and fossil-fuel subsidies and cross-subsidies.

617,Energy Policy Design and China’s Local Climate Governance: Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Policies in Hangzhou,"This study probes climate policy design at city level in China, with Hangzhou’s energy efficiency (EE) and renewable energy (RE) policies between 2005 and 2014 as a case. The study applies a political action arena approach to accentuate the importance of different normative preferences behind climate change policies in relation to Hangzhou’s emerging urban climate governance regime. Three main categories of policy instruments are identified—that is, command-and-control, market-based, and collaborative governance instruments—and their development over time is examined. It is concluded that in Hangzhou EE is a more mature and comprehensive political action arena than RE. The study also finds that there has been a significant shift away from preferences toward command-and-control to more market-based instruments, while cooperative governance instruments are still in their infancy. It finally shows that the design and implementation of local programs, especially the selection of policy instruments, are strongly influenced by the normative preferences of local officials. Thus, the approach of Hangzhou’s government to the design and implementation of climate policies seem to gradually become less authoritarian, more market based, and more accountable due to the inherent complexity of this political action arena.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-981-13-2799-5_32,"['Guan, Ting', 'Delman, Jørgen']",The Palgrave Handbook of Local Governance in Contemporary China,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-13-2799-5_32,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

622,Advanced Green Logistics Strategies and Technologies,"Green Logistics is no longer just a temporary fashion, but a topic that has been discussed by experts for many years. What is new is, on the one hand, the increased social and political awareness and, on the other hand, the transfer of green core statements to entrepreneurial problems. Not least the economic crisis that began at the end of 2008 reinforced the change in attitude towards a more sustainable economy. As a result of the crisis, the cost situation but also the competitive environment has intensified for companies, which are now also concentrating on areas such as waste disposal logistics, which had previously not been taken into account. Concrete climate protection strategies, for example, to prevent CO_2 emissions, are therefore being actively pursued by industrial companies, particularly by companies with high transport volumes. For the transport industry as such, which is strongly affected by rising fuel prices, more efficient transports mean not only a reduction of CO_2 emissions, but also cost savings in economic terms. Accordingly, the basic methods and principles of Green Logistics and their relationship to Logistics Social Responsibility and Sustainable Supply Chain Management are outlined in this chapter. The advanced part of the chapter describes detailed instruments for Green Logistics strategies and coordination as well as provides a technical overview regarding latest green transportation developments, including a case study regarding green waste disposal logistics.

623,The Context of Sustainable Urban Transport,"In this chapter, the authors look at the three main challenges that cities and metropolitan areas face in dealing with the challenge of sustainable transport. In the context of increasing liberal values and privatization policies, they face a planning challenge, at a time when government intervention is seen as lacking in efficiency. Second, the cities face an extending urban landscape, with a fragmenting spatial configuration that is not conducive to public transport. Third, cities face a public policy challenge, due to the fact that an increasing variety and number of stakeholders demand that their point of view be heard and considered. Drawing from public policy and political studies literature, Mercier and his colleagues then identify two policy configurations to deal with these challenges, the government (more top-down) mode, and the governance (more horizontal, participative) mode. Building on the differences between these two styles of public policy, the authors then propose a model of policy instruments which can be helpful in ascertaining the contribution of these two policy configuration in attaining sustainable urban transport.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-99091-0_2,"['Mercier, Jean', 'Tremblay-Racicot, Fanny', 'Carrier, Mario', 'Duarte, Fábio']",Governance and Sustainable Urban Transport in the Americas,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-99091-0_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
624,"The impact of economic growth, energy consumption, trade openness, and financial development on carbon emissions: empirical evidence from Turkey","This study examines the impact of economic growth, energy consumption, trade openness, financial development on carbon emissions for the case of Turkey by using annual time series data for the period of 1960–2013. The Lee and Strazicich test suggests that the variables are suitable for applying the bounds testing approach to cointegration. The cointegration analysis reveals that there exists a long-run relationship between the per capita real income, per capita energy consumption, trade openness, financial development, and per capita carbon emissions in the presence of structural breaks. The results show that in the long run, carbon emissions are mainly determined by economic growth, energy consumption, trade openness, and financial development. The VECM Granger causality analysis indicates a long-run unidirectional causality running from economic growth, energy consumption, trade openness, and financial development to carbon emissions. The findings also show that the EKC hypothesis is valid for Turkey both in the long run and short run. The study provides some implications for policy makers to decrease carbon emissions in Turkey.",2018-12-01,10.1007/s11356-018-3526-5,"['Cetin, Murat', 'Ecevit, Eyyup', 'Yucel, Ali Gokhan']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-018-3526-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
625,The Potential Gains from Carbon Emissions Trading in China’s Industrial Sectors,"The command and control mechanism and the market trading mechanism have been adopted by Chinese government to reduce the industrial carbon emissions. Concerns have arisen over which policy is more effective and what are the potential gains from carbon emissions trading for industrial sectors. A Data Envelopment Analysis based linear programming technology is used to compare the industrial potential gains including both the economic potential gains and the environmental potential gains from the command and control and carbon emissions trading mechanisms. An empirical study containing the data set of 38 sub-industries in China from 2006–2014 is conducted. The empirical results show that the carbon emissions trading mechanism can produce more potential gains compared with the command and control mechanism, with an average of 69.6 and 92.0% economic potential gains and 49.1 and 21.0% environmental potential gains in terms of the overall level and industrial level, respectively. Additionally, the environmental potential gains of each sub-industry can provide theoretical support for the emission quotas allocation. Finally, several policy implications based on the empirical results are proposed.",2018-12-01,10.1007/s10614-017-9724-2,"['Yu, Yanni', 'Zhang, Weijie', 'Zhang, Ning']",Computational Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10614-017-9724-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

One indicates why it is appropriate to assume that an international carbon market, with emission rights given to different groups of countries will exist. One discusses the approach to evaluate correctly abatement costs and welfare losses incurred by different groups of countries when implementing climate policies. Finally, using a recently proposed meta-model of game with a coupled constraint on a cumulative CO_2 emissions budget, we assess several new scenarios for possible fair burden sharing in climate policies compatible with the Paris Agreement.",2018-12-01,10.1007/s10666-018-9630-6,"['Babonneau, Frédéric', 'Bernard, Alain', 'Haurie, Alain', 'Vielle, Marc']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10666-018-9630-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

We found by observing the characteristics of publications that such studies belong to a multidisciplinary field that has been continuously developing since the 1990s. The USA and the UK have maintained their leading research strengths in the field, whereas China entered late but has developed rapidly. The most productive journal, institution, and author in this field are Energy Policy, Resources for the Future, and Pizer from the USA, respectively. The auctorial and institutional cooperation degrees are growing and still have a broad collaboration space, but the cooperation among countries is fluctuating at a lower level. Nonetheless, the USA keeps its significant international cooperation ties. The bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis reveals that articles in this field are closely related to one another. The basic literature in the field was written by Weitzman and published in 1974, and the article by Nordhaus published in Science in 1992 is the most cited in the field.

This study calculates the carbon footprint, wherein the greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions data are based on carbon footprint standards. Many firms have redesigned their supply chain networks to reduce their GHG emissions. Furthermore, the production capacities and costs are collected and evaluated by using Pareto optimal solutions. In order to achieve the optimal solutions, a normal constraint method is used to formulate a mathematical model to meet two objectives: low carbon emissions and low cost. A case study is also presented to demonstrate the predictive ability of this model. The result shows that it is possible to reduce carbon emissions and lower cost simultaneously.",2018-12-01,10.1007/s10614-017-9675-7,"['Kuo, Tsai-Chi', 'Tseng, Ming-Lang', 'Chen, Hsiao-Min', 'Chen, Ping-Shun', 'Chang, Po-Chen']",Computational Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10614-017-9675-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

630,A pioneer country? A history of Norwegian climate politics,"The shift away from ecology towards climatology in Norwegian environmental policy in the late 1980s and 1990s was not accidental. A main mover was the Labor Party politician Gro Harlem Brundtland who did not want to deal with unruly and highly vocal Deep Ecologists. Better then to start afresh with a different set of environmental scholars appealing to the technocratic tradition within the Labor Party. Instead of changing the ethical and social ways of dealing with environmental problems as the Deep Ecologists were advocating, she was looking for technological and economic solutions. And she mobilized an international regime of carbon capture storage (CCS), tradable carbon emissions quota (TEQs), and clean development mechanisms (CDMs), all of which eventually were approved in Kyoto in 1997. This move towards technocracy and cost-benefit economics reflects a post-Cold War turn towards utilitarian capitalism, but also a longing to showcase Norway as an environmental pioneer country to the world. The underlying question was how to reconcile the nation’s booming petroleum industry with reduction in climate gas emissions. Should the oil and gas stay underground and the country strive towards the ecologically informed zerogrowth society the Deep Ecologists were envisioning? Or could growth in the petroleum industry take place without harming the environment as the Labor Party environmentalists argued?",2018-11-01,10.1007/s10584-016-1653-x,"['Anker, Peder']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-016-1653-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
631,The environmental Kuznets curve relationship: a case study of the Gulf Cooperation Council region,"By using panel data over the 1980–2017 period and two alternative indicators of environmental pollution (carbon dioxide (CO_2) and sulfur dioxide (SO_2) emissions), this paper investigates the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Using three alternative econometric estimation techniques, we find strong evidence of a long-run inverted U-shaped relationship between real GDP per capita and both environmental indicators in the GCC region. Country-level short-run analysis indicates that the EKC hypothesis holds for Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) when CO_2 emissions are used as a measure of environmental pollution. However, when SO_2 emissions are used as a measure of environmental pollution, the EKC hypothesis holds for Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. The results of a recently developed panel causality test reveal one-way causality from real GDP per capita to CO_2 emissions and from real GDP per capita to SO_2 emissions.",2018-11-01,10.1007/s11356-018-3161-1,"['Alsamara, Mouyad', 'Mrabet, Zouhair', 'Saleh, Ali Salman', 'Anwar, Sajid']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-018-3161-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
632,The erratic behaviour of the EU ETS on the path towards consolidation and price stability,"The Kyoto Protocol envisages the use of various instruments to achieve emission reduction targets, one of which is the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), the most important market worldwide for CO_2 emission allowances. The volume of European Union Allowances traded represents over 45% of all the carbon dioxide generated by human activity within the continent. In its first two phases (2005–2012), the behaviour of the EU ETS was erratic, as a result of discretionary policies, an oversupply of allowances and reduced economic activity due to the global crisis. These factors caused excessively low prices that distorted the initial goals of achieving low-carbon solutions. From 2013, changes were made to the market regulation mechanisms in order to correct these structural deficiencies. Empirical analysis of daily prices in the two central phases of the market, following the pattern of ARCH and GARCH models, shows that the measures taken within the EU generated greater confidence and stability in the market and thus reduced volatility. Subsequent price behaviour, following a bullish path, has confirmed the success of the measures taken and their contribution to fulfilling emission reduction targets.",2018-10-01,10.1007/s10784-018-9411-3,"['Galán-Valdivieso, Federico', 'Villar-Rubio, Elena', 'Huete-Morales, María-Dolores']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-018-9411-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

The near-universal consensus is that the accumulation in the atmosphere of greenhouse gases heats the Earth’s climate, that an increase above 2 °C imperils the basis of human life, and that one beyond 3 °C threatens its destruction. Global heating is the flipside of the phenomenal economic and demographic development of the past half century. Ever more people are enjoying, or pursuing, ever more comfortable and mobile lifestyles, the cumulative effect is to push the Earth beyond its carrying capacity. Recognizing these dangers, the 2015 Paris Agreement was a major achievement – but not good enough, because chances are slim that it will be realized and, even if it were, it would not suffice. Global heating is beyond individual or national remedial action. Organizing decarbonization at the proper scale and speed is the formidable global public policy challenge on which the survival of the human species depends. Can governments deliver? And what, if they can’t?",2018-10-01,10.1057/s41312-018-0065-5,"['Baumann, Franz']",International Politics Reviews,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/s41312-018-0065-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
634,Non-linear Pass-Through of the CO2 Emission-Allowance Price onto Wholesale Electricity Prices,"This article considers the evidence for threshold effects in the relationship between electricity and emission-permit prices in France and Germany during the second phase of the EU ETS. Specifically, we compare linear and non-linear threshold models of electricity prices using the sample-splitting and threshold estimation approach in Hansen ( Econometrica, 64 575–603 2000 ). We find evidence of non-linear threshold effects in both countries. The estimated carbon-price thresholds are 14.94€ and 12.57€ in France and Germany respectively. The carbon-price threshold in France perfectly matches the well-known carbon spot-price structural break of October 2008. This is not the case for the carbon-price threshold in Germany. Further analysis reveals that carbon prices before October 2008 were not reflected in electricity prices in either country. This is mainly due to uncertainty about the future of the EU ETS that led electricity producers to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. After October 2008, French electricity producers passed the price of emission permits through to electricity prices in a linear way, while their German counterparts did so non-linearly. Finally, we suggest improvements to the design of the EU ETS. Our recommendations are to strengthen the price signal to make it more clear and reliable and provide sufficient incentives for energy transition.",2018-10-01,10.1007/s10666-018-9603-9,"['Ahamada, Ibrahim', 'Kirat, Djamel']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10666-018-9603-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
635,Can Technology-Specific Deployment Policies Be Cost-Effective? The Case of Renewable Energy Support Schemes,"While there is relatively limited disagreement on the general need for supporting the deployment of renewable energy sources for electricity generation (RES-E), there are diverging views on whether the granted support levels should be technology-neutral or technology-specific. In this review paper we question the frequently stressed argument that technology-neutral schemes will promote RES-E deployment cost-effectively. We use a simple partial equilibrium model of the electricity sector with one representative investor as a vehicle to synthesize the existing literature, and review potential rationales for technology-specific RES-E support. The analysis addresses market failures associated with technological development, long-term risk taking, path dependencies as well as various external costs, all of which drive a wedge between the private and the social costs of RES-E deployment. Based on analytical insight and a review of empirical literature, we conclude that the relevance of these market failures is typically heterogeneous across different RES-E technologies. The paper also discusses a number of possible caveats to implementing cost-effective technology-specific support schemes in practice, including the role of various informational and politico-economic constraints. While these considerations involve important challenges, neither of them suggests an unambiguous plea for technology-neutral RES-E support policies either. We close by highlighting principles for careful RES-E policy design, and by outlining four important avenues for future research.",2018-10-01,10.1007/s10640-017-0169-9,"['Lehmann, Paul', 'Söderholm, Patrik']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-017-0169-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
636,Research on the ecological efficiency of the Yangtze River Delta region in China from the perspective of sustainable development of the economy-energy-environment (3E) system,"Balancing the relationship between economic development, energy utilization, and environmental protection has become an important task in China’s Strip Planning and Construction. This article takes the annual panel data from 2005 to 2015 as the research object firmly grasps the research basis of the Economy-Energy-Environment (3E) System, and focuses on building a new research framework from both internal and external perspectives of the eco-efficiency index to achieve the exploratory research on regional ecological efficiency changes and influencing factors. First of all, it uses super-efficient slacks-based measure (SBM) model which introduces undesired outputs to measure eco-efficiency at different levels. Then, it applies Malmquist index to calculate total factor productivity and structural efficiencies. Finally, it selects six indicators and uses the STIRPAT regression model to analyze external factors. The results indicate that (1) the overall ecological efficiency is effective and maintaining a good momentum of development. Among all the cities and provinces, Shanghai and Zhejiang provinces play the role of “stabilizers,” while Jiangsu and Anhui provinces act as “accelerators.” (2) All 41 prefecture-level cities can be divided into four different types, i.e., “high-high”, “low-high”, “low-low,” and “high-low” cities, and there is an obvious phenomenon of spatial clustering; (3) pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency is the core driving force for the improvement of ecological efficiency. (4) Anhui and Jiangsu provinces show a U-shaped relationship, while Zhejiang province shows an inverted U-shaped relationship.

637,Effects of the US withdrawal from Paris Agreement on the carbon emission space and cost of China and India,"Climate mitigation has become a global issue and most countries have promised their greenhouse gas reduction target. However, after Trump took office as president of the United States (US), the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement. As the biggest economy, this would have impacts on the emission space of other countries. This paper, by using the integrated model of energy, environment and economy/computable general equilibrium (IMED/CGE) model, assesses the impacts of the US withdrawal from Paris Agreement on China, India in terms of carbon emission space and mitigation cost under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and 2°C scenarios due to changed emission pathway of the US. The results show that, under the condition of constant global cumulative carbon emissions and fixed burden sharing scheme among the countries, the failure of the US to honor its NDC commitment will increase its carbon emission space and decrease its mitigation cost. However, the carbon emission space of other regions, including China and India, will be reduced and their mitigation costs will be raised. In 2030, under the 2°C target, the carbon price will increase by US$14.3 to US$45.3/t in China and by US $10.7 to US$33.9/t in India. In addition, China and India will incur additional GDP loss. Under the 2°C target, the GDP loss of China would increase by US$23.3 to US$72.6 billion (equivalent to US$17.4 to US$54.2/capita), and that of India would rise by US$14.2 to US$43.1 billion (equivalent to US$9.3 to US$28.2/capita).",2018-09-01,10.1007/s11708-018-0574-y,"['Dai, Hancheng', 'Xie, Yang', 'Zhang, Haibin', 'Yu, Zhongjue', 'Wang, Wentao']",Frontiers in Energy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11708-018-0574-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
638,Environment-biased technological progress and industrial land-use efficiency in China’s new normal,"The slow growth of the Chinese economy has led to a reduced number of environmental regulations. This study aims to establish whether China’s “new normal” economy can stimulate environment-biased technological progress to improve industrial land-use efficiency. First, we set up a two-sector theoretical model where in the new normal is treated as an exogenous variable to analyze the combined effects of technological progress, industrial land-use efficiency, and environmental regulations. Then, we establish a multi-index and multi-indicator constitutive equation, in which environment-biased technological progress is taken as an intermediate variable. The results show that the effects of weak environmental regulations on environment-biased technological progress are not significant and that China’s new normal economy can stimulate the progress of clean technology, thereby improving industrial land-use efficiency. Finally, foreign direct investment restricts the improvement of industrial land-use efficiency.",2018-09-01,10.1007/s10479-016-2307-0,"['Song, Malin', 'Wang, Shuhong', 'Wu, Kaiya']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-016-2307-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
639,Multi-criteria decision making approaches for green supply chains: a review,"Designing Green Supply Chains (GSCs) requires complex decision-support models that can deal with multiple dimensions of sustainability while taking into account specific characteristics of products and their supply chain. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approaches can be used to quantify trade-offs between economic, social, and environmental criteria i.e. to identify green production options. The aim of this paper is to review the use of MCDM approaches for designing efficient and effective GSCs. We develop a conceptual framework to find relevant publications and to categorise papers with respect to decision problems, indicators, and MCDM approaches. The analysis shows that (1) the use of MCDM approaches for designing GSCs is a rather new but emerging research field, (2) most of the publications focus on production and distribution problems, and there are only a few inventory models with environmental considerations, (3) the majority of papers assume all data to be deterministic, (4) little attention has been given to minimisation of waste, (5) numerous indicators are used to account for eco-efficiency, indicating the lack of standards. This study, therefore, identifies the need for more multi-criteria models for real-life GSCs, especially with inclusion of uncertainty in parameters that are associated with GSCs.",2018-09-01,10.1007/s10696-016-9263-5,"['Banasik, Aleksander', 'Bloemhof-Ruwaard, Jacqueline M.', 'Kanellopoulos, Argyris', 'Claassen, G.

We employed the panel unit root test and co-integration test, along with cross-sectional dependence and cross-sectionally augmented IPS unit root test by Pesaran (J Appl Econ 22:265–312, 2007). We also employed dynamic ordinary least squares, fully modified ordinary least squares, and fixed effect ordinary least squares regression. The result concluded that all the variables are co-integrated in the long run and all the variables create a significant effect on CO_2 emission. This study implies that economic growth and trade increases the CO_2 emission in the long run whereas the renewable energy consumption reduces the CO_2 emission in the long run.

641,Cutting with both arms of the scissors: the economic and political case for restrictive supply-side climate policies,"Proponents of climate change mitigation face difficult choices about which types of policy instrument(s) to pursue. The literature on the comparative evaluation of climate policy instruments has focused overwhelmingly on economic analyses of instruments aimed at restricting demand for greenhouse gas emissions (especially carbon taxes and cap-and-trade schemes) and, to some extent, on instruments that support the supply of or demand for substitutes for emissions-intensive goods, such as renewable energy. Evaluation of instruments aimed at restricting the upstream supply of commodities or products whose downstream consumption causes greenhouse gas emissions—such as fossil fuels—has largely been neglected in this literature. Moreover, analyses that compare policy instruments using both economic and political (e.g. political “feasibility” and “feedback”) criteria are rare. This article aims to help bridge both of these gaps. Specifically, the article demonstrates that restrictive supply-side policy instruments (targeting fossil fuels) have numerous characteristic economic and political advantages over otherwise similar restrictive demand-side instruments (targeting greenhouse gases). Economic advantages include low administrative and transaction costs, higher abatement certainty (due to the relative ease of monitoring, reporting and verification), comprehensive within-sector coverage, some advantageous price/efficiency effects, the mitigation of infrastructure “lock-in” risks, and mitigation of the “green paradox”. Political advantages include the superior potential to mobilise public support for supply-side policies, the conduciveness of supply-side policies to international policy cooperation, and the potential to bring different segments of the fossil fuel industry into a coalition supportive of such policies. In light of these attributes, restrictive supply-side policies squarely belong in the climate policy “toolkit”.",2018-09-01,10.1007/s10584-018-2162-x,"['Green, Fergus', 'Denniss, Richard']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-018-2162-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
642,Investigating vulnerability of ecological industrial symbiosis network based on automatic control theory,"System fluctuations of eco-industrial symbiosis network (EISN) organization due to disturbance are very similar to the controller adjustment in the automatic control theory. Thus, a methodology is proposed in this study to assess the vulnerability of EISN based on the automatic control theory. The results show that the regulator plays a key role to enhance the resilience of the network system to vulnerability. Therefore, it is imperative to strengthen the real-time regulation and control of EISN so that the system stability is improved. In order to further explore the impact of various regulations on the system vulnerability, the influence of system stability is simulated by means of proportional, differential, and integral control. A case study with Guigang eco-industrial park (EIP) was undertaken to test this model. The results showed that when the system was disturbed at different positions, the key nodes which had great influence on system vulnerability could be selected according to the magnitude of simulation curve. By changing the ratio coefficient of proportional, differential, and integral units to adjust the ecological chain network, the system’s resilience to vulnerability can be enhanced. Firstly, if basic conditions of EISN organization remain unchanged, the integral control of the policy support and infrastructure sharing should be strengthened. Secondly, the differential regulation should be improved continuously for the technological innovation capability of key node enterprises. Finally, the key chain filling projects should be introduced for proportional control so that the chain network design can be optimized from the source.",2018-09-01,10.1007/s11356-018-2753-0,"['Wang, Qingsong', 'Tang, Hongrui', 'Yuan, Xueliang', 'Zuo, Jian', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Gao, Zhenlei', 'Hong, Jinglan']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-018-2753-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Results showed that China (962), USA (324) and Iran (140) are the most productive countries. Chinese Academy of Sciences (149), Tongji University (49), and Harbin Institute of Technology (40) from China are the most contributive institutions. China and USA played central roles in cross-national cooperation, but the top three Chinese institutions displayed limited vitality in overseas communication.

644,Estimation of marginal abatement costs of CO_2 in Chinese provinces under 2020 carbon emission rights allocation: 2005–2020,"The calculation of marginal abatement costs of CO_2 plays a vital role in meeting China’s 2020 emission reduction targets by providing reference for determining carbon tax and carbon trading pricing. However, most existing researches only used one method to discuss regional and industrial marginal abatement costs, and almost no studies predicted future marginal abatement costs from the perspective of CO_2 emission efficiency. To make up for the gaps, this paper first estimates marginal abatement costs of CO_2 in three major industries of 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2015 based on three assumptions. Second, based on the principle of fairness and efficiency, China’s 2020 emission reduction targets are decomposed by province. Based on the ZSG-C-DDF model, the marginal abatement costs of CO_2 in all provinces in China in 2020 are estimated and compared with the marginal abatement costs of 2005 to 2015. The results show that (1) from 2005 to 2015, marginal abatement costs of CO_2 in all provinces show a fluctuating upward trend; (2) compared with the marginal abatement costs of primary industry or tertiary industry, most provinces have lower marginal abatement costs for secondary industry; and (3) the average marginal abatement costs of CO_2 for China in 2020 are 2766.882 Yuan/tonne for the 40% carbon intensity reduction target and 3334.836 Yuan/tonne for the 45% target, showing that the higher the emission reduction target, the higher the marginal abatement costs of CO_2. (4) Overall, the average marginal abatement costs of CO_2 in China by 2020 are higher than those in 2005–2015.

645,"Carbon Risk, Carbon Risk Awareness and the Cost of Debt Financing","We seek insights into potential benefits for firms adopting strategies to improve business sustainability in a carbon-constrained future. We investigate whether lenders incorporate a firm’s exposure to carbon-related risk into lending decisions through the cost of financing, and if so, importantly whether firms can mitigate the penalty by demonstrating an awareness of their carbon risks. We use a sample of 255 firm-year observations from eight industries over the period 2009–2013. We measure carbon-related risk exposure as the firm’s historical carbon emissions and our primary measure of carbon risk awareness is based on the firm’s willingness to respond to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) survey. We document a positive association between cost of debt and carbon risk for firms failing to respond to the CDP. Further, this association is economically meaningful, with a one standard deviation increase in carbon risk mapping into between a 38 and 62 basis point increase in the cost of debt. Equally, we find that this penalty is effectively negated for firms exhibiting carbon risk awareness. Our results are robust when we consider alternate measures of carbon awareness—disclosure through alternative medium to the CDP and firms’ annual cash investment in new capital assets using “cleaner” technology. Our results highlight not only the importance of carbon awareness as a business strategy for polluting firms, but also its importance to lenders exposed to their clients’ default and reputational risk.

Volatility is synonymous with risk and so an understanding of volatility in EUA market is important for making investment decisions. Large changes in volatility of EUA market are capable of giving adverse signals to risk averse investors. The price of EUA, understandably, moves together with prices of crude oil, coal and natural gas. Using EUA daily returns from 2005 to 2015 (covering all three phases of EU ETS and EUA Continuous Series), we investigate volatility co-movement between the EUA market and the energy markets i.e. brent (crude oil), coal and natural gas markets. We employ Multivariate GARCH (BEKK-MGARCH) model and use data of European Climate Exchange Dec 2007, Dec 2012, Dec 2015 expiry and the Continuous Dec 2015 expiry EUA future contracts.

647,"Decoupling emissions of greenhouse gas, urbanization, energy and income: analysis from the economy of China","The adoption and ratification of relevant policies, particularly the household enrolment system metamorphosis in China, led to rising urbanization growth. As the leading developing economy, China has experienced a drastic and rapid increase in the rate of urbanization, energy use, economic growth and greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution for the past 30 years. The knowledge of the dynamic interrelationships among these trends has a plethora of implications ranging from demographic, energy, and environmental and sustainable development policies. This study analyzes the role of urbanization in decoupling GHG emissions, energy, and income in China while considering the critical contribution of energy use. As a contribution to the extant body of literature, the present research introduces a new phenomenon called “the environmental urbanization Kuznets curve” (EUKC), which shows that at the early stage of urbanization, the environment degrades however, after a threshold point the technique effects surface and environmental degradation reduces with rise in urbanization. Applying the autoregressive distributed lag model and the vector error correction model, the paper finds the presence of inverted U-shaped curve between urbanization and GHG emission of CO_2, while the same hypothesis cannot be found between income and GHG emission of CO_2. Energy use in all the models contributes to GHG emission of CO_2. In decoupling greenhouse gas emissions, urbanization, energy, and income, articulated and well-implemented energy and urbanization policies should be considered.",2018-07-01,10.1007/s11356-018-2088-x,"['Wang, Tianqiong', 'Riti, Joshua Sunday', 'Shu, Yang']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-018-2088-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

While the ecosystem services narrative is being forwarded globally as a key paradigm for promoting business sustainability, there is scarce knowledge of how these issues are considered at managerial level. This study thus investigates managerial views of corporate sustainability after the ecosystem services concept. We analyse interviews conducted with 20 managers from domestic and international forestry companies operating with a plantation-based business model in China. Content analysis was employed to analyse the data, with a focus on four key areas: (1) interviewee familiarity with the ecosystem services concept; (2) their views of corporate dependencies and impacts on ecosystem services; (3) related business risks and opportunities; and (4) viability of existing instruments and practices that can be employed in detecting and addressing business impacts and dependencies on ecosystem services.

649,Interval joint-probabilistic chance-constrained programming with two-side multi-randomness: an application to energy-environment systems management,"Regional energy-environment systems management become more and more focused on greenhouse gas emission control through improving energy efficiency and efficiently managing energy activities. Inexact linear programming models are developed for supporting the management. Due to the weather/climatic variations in the future, electricity demands and renewable power generations (in the right/left hand sides of constraints) have random characteristics. Moreover, an overall satisfactory level needs to be quantified based on multiple chance constraints. Therefore, this study improved upon traditional chance-constrained programming and interval linear programming, and developed an interval joint-probabilistic two-side chance-constrained programming (IJTCP) approach. A sufficient but non-equivalent linearization form of the model was proposed so that the inexact model could be solved through the two-step solution algorithm. The IJTCP was then applied to an integrated energy-environment systems management under dual uncertainties. The application demonstrated that the IJTCP can effectively address the uncertainties presented as not only interval numbers and two-side multi-randomness but also the reliability of satisfying the entire system constraints. The application implicated that the IJTCP approach can be applied to other energy-environment management problems under dual uncertainties.",2018-07-01,10.1007/s00477-017-1502-0,"['Li, Gongchen', 'Sun, Wei', 'Lv, Ying', 'Cheng, Guanhui', 'Chen, Yumin', 'Huang, Guo H.']",Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00477-017-1502-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
650,The Effect of Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility on Environmental Performance and Business Competitiveness: The Mediation of Green Information Technology Capital,"With the emergence of environmental sustainability and green business management, increasing demands have been made on businesses in the areas of environmental corporate social responsibility (ECSR). Furthermore, the influence of ECSR on green capital investment, environmental performance, and business competitiveness has also been the subject of attention from enterprises. However, in previous studies, the mediating role of green information technology (IT) capital in the relationship between ECSR, environmental performance, and business competitiveness, has not been investigated by researchers. In order to bridge this gap in the ECSR literature, this study aims to examine the influence of ECSR on green IT capital, and the consequent effect of green IT capital on environmental performance and business competitiveness. Data were collected from 358 companies from the top 1000 manufacturers in Taiwan. The results confirmed that ECSR has significant positive effects on green IT human capital, green IT structural capital, and green IT relational capital. Green IT structural capital and green IT relational capital have positive effects on environmental performance and business competitiveness, and environmental performance has a positive effect on business competitiveness. In addition, green IT structural capital and green IT relational capital have partial mediating effects on ECSR, environmental performance, and business competitiveness.

651,Research on carbon market price mechanism and influencing factors: a literature review,"Carbon emissions trading is being used by more and more countries or regions to solve the global warming problem. The establishment of China’s carbon market mechanism is still under exploration and improvement. This paper focuses on the price determination mechanism in the carbon market. Based on the price theories, we analyze the theoretical basis of the carbon price formation and the carbon price transmission mechanism from the perspective of the agents that affect carbon price. From these angles including residents’ demands, enterprises’ actual emissions and indirect effects on residents’ demands, the government’s setting for carbon market institutions and indirect effects on residents and enterprises, as well as energy markets and financial markets, we analyze how these factors influence the carbon price. In turn, we discuss how carbon price affects the enterprise costs, energy-saving technologies and residents’ welfare. Besides, we summarize the current price mechanism of domestic and overseas major carbon markets.

652,The potential of WHR/batch and cullet preheating for energy efficiency in the EU ETS glass industry and the related energy incentives,"The European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) covers approximately 45% of European greenhouse gases (GHGs), 11,000 stationary installations as well as aircraft operators. The EU ETS particularly affects the energy-intensive industries while it imposes a significant risk of “carbon leakage,” i.e., the risk of EU industry departing to countries with weaker restraints on GHG emissions. The EU glass industry, being capital intensive and also requiring long investment cycles, is the world’s largest glass producer with a market share close to one third of global production. Therefore, it is of significant importance to view the position of the EU ETS glass industry in terms of energy conservation possibilities. The present paper utilizes a vertical approach to provide information on both ETS market evolution and specific technical information to support technological innovation to the glass industry. EU ETS glass industry is analyzed regarding the balance between allocated European Union emission allowances (EUAs), verified CO_2 emissions, and potential shortfall in allowances so as to determine the situation of glass industries and the extent of urge for energy-saving activities towards the strengthening of their position within the requirements of the EU ETS phase III. The replication potential of waste heat recovery (WHR) through batch preheating is specifically addressed since it is considered a promising technology according to the latest Best Available Techniques (BAT) reference document for the glass industry under Directive IED 2010/75/EU. A case study for a container glass furnace based on simulation results is presented investigating the impact of different operating and design configurations on specific energy consumption and CO_2 emissions.",2018-06-01,10.1007/s12053-017-9587-3,"['Karellas, Sotirios', 'Giannakopoulos, Dionysios', 'Hatzilau, Christina-Stavrula', 'Dolianitis, Ioannis', 'Skarpetis, Georgios', 'Zitounis, Theodoros']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12053-017-9587-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
653,Offset Credits in the EU ETS: A Quantile Estimation of Firm-Level Transaction Costs,"International carbon offset certificates were cheaper than European Union Allowances, although they were substitutes within the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Thus, firms had a strong incentive to use offset certificates. However, a considerable number of firms did not exhaust their offset quota and, by doing so, seemingly forwent profits. While most literature on emissions trading evaluates the efficiency of regulation in a frictionless world, in practice firms incur costs when complying with regulation. In order to assess the relevance of trade-related fixed transaction costs, this study examines the use of international offset credits in the EU ETS. It establishes a model of firm decision under fixed (quantity-invariant) entry costs and estimates the size of such costs rationalizing firm behavior using semi-parametric binary quantile regressions. Comparing binary quantile results with probit estimates shows that high average transaction costs result from a strongly skewed underlying distribution. For most firms, the bulk of transaction costs stems from certificate trading in general, rather than additional participation in offset trading.",2018-05-01,10.1007/s10640-017-0111-1,"['Naegele, Helene']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-017-0111-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
654,"Energy Efficiency Convergence in China: Catch-Up, Lock-In and Regulatory Uniformity","This paper examines alternative hypotheses of beta convergence for different measures of energy efficiency. We collect a novel set of prefecture-level data that substantially extend the breadth of the datasets ever used in this literature. GMM estimators are then used to empirically test the national and club convergence of energy efficiency among these prefectures. We find strong evidence for prefecture-level national and club convergence in energy efficiency. In particular, the listed key environmental protection (KEP) prefectures, prefectures in central and western regions and prefectures not listed as resource-based (RB) converge faster than the non-KEP prefectures, prefectures in eastern region and RB prefectures.

655,Developing China’s National Emission Trading Scheme: Experiences from Existing Global Schemes and China’s Pilot Programs,"Market-based emission trading schemes (ETSs) are widely used in the developed world to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions which are perceived as the source of global climate change. China, as the largest GHG emitter in the world, is committed to introducing an ETS to reduce emissions. Here we reviewed existing ETSs and sustainable energy policies worldwide as well as China’s pilot programs. These studies were conducted in order to propose recommendations for national initiatives and strategies to be implemented in China in relation to climate change adaptation and mitigation. It has been shown that setting emission caps in the context of a national emission intensity target is difficult. However, implementing reliable systems for measurement, reporting, and verification of emissions are essential. A two-level management system (by central and provincial governments) for carbon trading is beneficial to ensure uniform standards and compliance while maintaining flexibility. Persistent political support from, and effective coordination of, policies by the government are crucial. In addition, strengthening of institutional innovation, and the establishment of a national GHG emissions information system, are of equal importance. This vital information could provide a great opportunity for China to re-define its economic growth and take global leadership in combatting climate change.",2018-04-01,10.1007/s11769-018-0947-5,"['Ning, Bolun', 'Zhu, Yongguan', 'Xu, Zhihong', 'Fu, Bojie']",Chinese Geographical Science,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11769-018-0947-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

A hierarchical linear model approach,"Focusing on the mechanism of foreign direct investment on environment, we attempt to build a series of hierarchical linear models to explore the impact of foreign direct investment on China’s sulfur dioxide (SO_2) emissions by using the panel data of industrial sector in Chinese provinces from 2002 to 2013. The findings show that: Firstly, the industrial SO_2 emission shows a slow downward trend. Secondly, 27.96% of the variations of SO_2 emission intensity come from the differences between the provinces. Thirdly, foreign direct investment can explain 50.50% of the different changes in provincial SO_2 emission intensity due to economic scale effect, structural effect, technological effect, and environmental regulation effect. Among them, the scale effect and technical effect are negatively correlated with SO_2 emissions intensity, while structural and environmental regulation effects positively. Moreover, foreign direct investment can significantly inhibit the positive correlation of structural effect and weaken the negative correlation of technology effect on SO_2 emission intensity, but do not have a significant impact on SO_2 emission intensity by economic scale effect and environmental regulation effect.",2018-03-01,10.1007/s11069-017-3148-0,"['Cao, Xiang', 'Wang, Ping', 'Zhu, Bangzhu']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-017-3148-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Local energy markets, on which consumers and prosumers can trade locally produced renewable generation directly within their community, balance generation and consumption locally in a decentralized approach. We present a comprehensive concept, market design and simulation of a local energy market between 100 residential households. Our approach is based on a distributed information and communication technology, i.e. a private blockchain, which underlines the decentralized nature of local energy markets. Thus, we provide energy prosumers and consumers with a decentralized market platform for trading local energy generation without the need of a central intermediary.

660,Emission Trading Schemes and Carbon Markets in the NDCs: Their Contribution to the Paris Agreement,"At present there are 18 emission trading schemes (ETS) operating in the world. At the COP21 in Paris a clear path for climate and energy policies has been outlined over the coming decades: states have committed themselves to reach zero net emissions by the second half of this century and to maintain the average global temperature rise well below 2 °C, with an additional effort to stay within 1.5 °C. 191 countries, whose emissions cover 98.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions, have already submitted their INDCs/NDCs. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents a review of the existing ETS and the incumbent ones, like the Chinese national scheme. The ETS currently existing are summarized in a table and than described. Moreover, an overview of the countries which are planning to start new cap-and-trade systems is provided, as well as a table showing which countries included a reference to an ETS in their INDC/NDC. Second, it offers a comprehensive overview about what the countries included in their NDCs about national ETS and international carbon markets. In fact, many developing countries are now considering to access carbon finance to fulfil part of their commitments. But in order for them to receive this kind of finance, and therefore to be able to achieve their climate targets, there has to be a demand for credits. For this reason, understanding whether there will be this match between demand and offer for carbon credits will lead to more efficient choices in policy making, for both sides of the market and thus contribute to the achievement of the Paris Agreement.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-72874-2_31,"['Caciagli, Veronica']",Theory and Practice of Climate Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-72874-2_31,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
661,Technology Adoption Optimization with Heterogeneous Agents and Carbon Emission Trading Mechanism,"The adoption of new technologies with high efficiency and low emission is of great importance in achieving sustainable development. Most studies of technology adoption have been criticized of idealistically assuming only one global decision agent. In this paper, a model of optimizing technology adoption with heterogeneous agents is proposed. Each agent attempts to identify the optimal solution for a portion of the entire system. The heterogeneity in agents is the different demands they face. In order to internalize the external effects of emission, a quantity-based market incentive policy instruments - Carbon Emission Trading is implemented. With two heterogeneous agents, a bargaining process is introduced to reasonably allocate the profit to them. Computational tests are conducted with different market shares and different discounting factors. Numerical results show the impact of heterogeneity and carbon emission trading mechanism on the optimal technology adoptions. It is suggested that a smaller gap of agents’ market shares leads to earlier and more adoptions. Besides, adoptions remain no change when both agents have a same discounting factor. A big discounting factor of the seller will accelerate the adoptions in the buyer agent and the entire system if agents have different discounting factors.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-75429-1_20,"['Fang, Chenhao', 'Ma, Tieju']",Integrated Uncertainty in Knowledge Modelling and Decision Making,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-75429-1_20,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Other non-European actors have also played prominent roles in China.

666,Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions from Solid Waste Management: Prognosis of Related Issues,"The implementation of cleaner waste treatment technologies in developing countries is accompanied by myriads of limitations and obstacles. This study reports that greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions that would not have happened with business-as-usual scenarios are achievable in the waste management system under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The grounds for CDM failures and successes were reviewed by reflecting on the past and current episodes in developing countries. It was found that economic development was directly proportional to increase in waste generation rate and influenced waste composition. The need to decouple waste production from Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and linking the prevalence of more low-carbon emissions waste treatment options were found essential to ensure sustainable development and mitigate climate change. Based on the present evaluation, Brazil and Thailand have had the largest number of CDM projects and mostly small-scale projects with the highest maximum emission reductions in Brazil (751, 148 Mt CO_2e) followed by Vietnam (158, 727 Mt CO_2e) and India (158, 077 Mt CO_2e). It was found that small-scale projects were more feasible as technology transfer and financial status were hindering the implementation of large-scale CDM projects. Moreover, emissions trading through CDM were accompanied by technical obstructions in terms of carbon leakage, permit allowances and unfair carbon price with irregular international policies and regulations to control GHGs. This study highlights the potential of a carbon trading scheme through CDM waste management projects designed to aid highly polluting developed countries achieve their target baselines for carbon emissions. The increasing GHG emissions in developing and least developed countries could be tackled at the early stages of economic growth through financial and technological assistance from industrialized countries.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-63612-2_22,"['Leelah, Sunjaya', 'Mudhoo, Ackmez']","The Nexus: Energy, Environment and Climate Change",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-63612-2_22,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

This article considers a manufacturer produce one product and assumes the customers are of low carbon and consisting of myopic customers and strategic customers. The customer decision is affected by the price and unit carbon emissions of the product. The paper examines the optimal pricing and greening policies for the manufacturer with and without green technology investment. It shows that the optimal prices in two scenarios are decreasing in the ratio and patience of strategic customers. The presence of strategic customers is detrimental to the manufacturer and the negative impact increases as the ratio and patience of strategic customers increases. It also shows that with the addition of carbon sensitive degree, the manufacturer will improve the regular sale price and invest more in green technology when the customer number exceed a certain threshold. Finally, the article analyzes the effect of green technology investment on the optimal price and find that the optimal price with green technology investment is lower than that without green technology investment.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-59280-0_105,"['Jiang, Wen']",Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Management Science and Engineering Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-59280-0_105,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

The main findings of carbon productivity evaluation include: (i) only China’s western area experiences carbon productivity growth during the entire study period; (ii) the primary driving force for carbon productivity increase can be attributed to technical progress both among areas and among regions, while the lack of catch-up effect drags carbon productivity growth. Moreover, the main findings of shadow prices estimation include: (i) in general, the CO_2 emissions abatement cost of China’s power industry sector increases during the 12th Five Year Plan period (2011–2015) with a range of 494–965 yuan/ton of CO_2; (ii) although the beta convergence shows the negative correlation between initial shadow price and its growth rate, there is significant shadow prices heterogeneity among areas and regions, which provides a necessity and possibility in emission abatement cost savings through the regional carbon emissions trading in power industry sector of China.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-981-10-7919-1_7,"['Xian, Yujiao', 'Wang, Ke']","Energy, Environment and Transitional Green Growth in China",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-10-7919-1_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

China and ASEAN’s environment governance capacity has been improved constantly as a result of socioeconomic development and international environmental actions, as well as in response to the requirements for environmental protection. They established national agencies to address environmental issues and at the same time made good use of regional cooperation mechanism. With future economic and social development, the emergence of new environmental issues, and the increased public awareness for environment protection, greater potential will be released for further development of national environmental governance system and regional environmental cooperation mechanisms for China and ASEAN Member States. Multilateral environmental agreements are the foundation of the solutions to global and regional issues. China and ASEAN are active in joining many multilateral regional and international environmental agreements pertaining to climate change, biodiversity, water pollution, air pollution, chemicals and wastes, coastal and marine resources, etc. China and ASEAN Member States developed and implemented many country-specific environment laws, action plans, and policy measures.

672,"The Electricity Mix in the European Low-Carbon Transformation: Coal, Nuclear, and Renewables","The European Union has embarked on the transformation of its energy and electricity system to low-carbon energy sources, just like Germany and many other countries. This chapter analyzes the European strategy for low-carbon transformation in relation to specific aspects and features of the German energiewende. Due to the different preferences, objectives, and institutional settings of decision-making processes in Germany and Europe, lessons from the German context are not directly applicable to the European context and vice versa. While some lessons apply to both—such as the German experience with ambitious CO_2 reduction targets—others do not, such as the potential role of coal and nuclear energy in the longer-term energy mix. The chapter begins with a brief survey of European energy (and later climate) policies going back to 1951, with the decisions to establish the European Community for Steel and Coal (ECSC) and subsequently Euratom in 1957. Section 10.2 covers the creation of the European internal market in the 1990s and its application to the energy sectors (mainly electricity and natural gas); it also covers more recent discussions, such as the energy and climate package to 2020, the 2030 targets, and the parallel discussion about longer-term orientations up to 2050. Sections 10.3 , 10.4 , and 10.5 analyze the three pillars of European transformation towards a low-carbon energy system: coal with CO_2 sequestration, nuclear power, and renewables. In this context, we discuss a major difference between the European transformation to a low-carbon economy and the German energiewende: The two energy sources that Germany has banned from its energy mix, coal and nuclear, are still high on the European agenda. Meanwhile, the potential of renewables has been systematically underestimated in European scenario documents, due mainly to an overestimation of costs and an underestimation of the technical potential. Section 10.6 then compares two alternative scenarios for a low-carbon transformation in Europe: one is the EU Reference Scenario, which is based on the traditional triad of coal (with CCTS), nuclear, and renewables. In the other scenario, based on our own modelling work, neither CCTS nor nuclear are available at a reasonable cost and renewables carry the major burden of decarbonisation.

The Nankai research group on efficiency and productivity, located in the College of Economic and Social Development at Nankai University, is one of the first research teams engaged in the study of the efficiency and green productivity growth of China’s economy. Since 2006 the Nankai research group, which includes scholars in industrial economics, regional economics and green logistics, has achieved fruitful research outcomes.

We interviewed these experts using a set of questions based on the main findings, conclusions, insights and questions that emerged from our set of case studies and conceptual papers. This section is divided into four parts, each focusing on a set of questions relating to the conclusions that emerged from the case study and conceptual chapters. (i) Focus on changes in production systems as adaptation: priorities and policy actions; (ii) Incorporating climate change into agricultural research and extension; (iii) Taking a close look at national policies affecting risk management: index insurance, safety nets and input subsidies and (iv) Priorities for the future and summary of main points. Overall, there is a fairly high level of agreement amongst the panel members in responding to most of the interview questions, although with some difference in emphasis or applications.

Faced with the enormous pressure of large amounts of carbon dioxide ( $$\mathrm{CO}_2$$ ) emissions, China is now actively implementing development strategy of low-carbon and emission reduction. Through the analysis of the influencing factors of $$\mathrm{CO}_2$$ emissions in China, five key influencing factors are selected: urbanization level, gross domestic product (GDP) of secondary industry, thermal power generation, real GDP per capital and energy consumption per unit of GDP. This paper applies the Elman neural network optimized by the firefly algorithm (FA) to forecasting the $$\mathrm{CO}_2$$ emissions in China. And the results show that the performance of the FA-Elman is better than the Elman and BPNN, verifying the effectiveness of the FA-Elman model for the $$\mathrm{CO}_2$$ emissions prediction.

The importance of the environmental component of CSR increased during this evolution. Initially, firms limited their actions to product innovations that reduce the final product’s environmental impact. This gradually evolved to process innovations, improving production processes and logistical systems. A new phase commenced when firms sought improvements beyond their own firm boundaries and collaborated vertically with their partners in the supply chain. The firms evaluated the environmental impact of their products during their whole life cycle to reduce these products’ environmental damage. A more recent and less discussed phenomenon is horizontal collaboration between firms. Firms seek environmental improvements in collaborative initiatives with competitors.

685,The evolution of CO_2 emissions in international trade for major economies: a perspective from the global supply chain,"Employing global multi-regional input–output models, this paper revisits the carbon dioxide (CO_2) emission trade (including exports and imports) and assesses their positions in the national emissions of 14 major countries with large national emissions or large emission trades during 1995–2009. It especially explores the evolution of the emission trades of these countries from both continuous time series and comparative perspectives, in order to provide an explanation for CO_2 emission spillovers across countries. The main findings obtained were as follows: (1) China was the largest CO_2 exporter to other countries, accounting for over 20 % of global exports since 2005; the CO_2 exports of the United States of America (USA), Germany, and Japan varied slightly over this time period, but overall, their proportions had decreased. (2) The CO_2 imports of the USA were the largest, occupying around 20 % of the global CO_2 imports; meanwhile, China’s CO_2 imports increased rapidly and ranked the second largest. (3) For Chinese Taiwan, its proportion of CO_2 exports in production-based emissions ranked the highest while that of the USA ranked the lowest; highly CO_2 import-dependent countries with an over 40 % proportion of CO_2 imports in its consumption-based emissions included France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, while China, India, and Russia remained the lowest, distinguished from their physical energy imports. These results suggested that the global policy makers should take the CO_2 emissions in trade into consideration when carefully accounting for national emissions inventories.",2017-12-01,10.1007/s11027-016-9724-x,"['Fan, Jing-Li', 'Wang, Qian', 'Yu, Shiwei', 'Hou, Yun-Bing', 'Wei, Yi-Ming']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-016-9724-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Less understood is why and how these innovations are developed. This paper further enriches our existing understanding by bringing to light an institutional element that has been relatively under-studied: the role of mission-driven local government agency. Informed by detailed on-site ethnography and process-tracing, I use meso-level and micro-level analyses of Baoding (Hebei) to illustrate how such an organization ushered in unique changes to local governance to facilitate two prolonged instances of policy innovation since the early 2000s: clean energy industry cluster and low-carbon city. Building on the insights from the literatures on communities of practice and experimentalist governance, I argue that the ways in which the local agency engendered and sustained the innovations can best be described as “collective” experimentalist governance. The analyses suggest that local innovations in China cannot always be understood as an epiphenomenon of centrally-coordinated policy experimentation, cross-regional competition or learning, or local leadership that previous studies have frequently emphasized.

Surprisingly, such tools have been rarely used in this literature despite widespread availability and use in other fields to make sense of complex data. We trace the history of visualizations from the early work of Minard and Snow up to the sophisticated, web-based interactive graphics we have today, and identify forms of visualization and their uses. We apply these tools to a specific preliminary case study: the number, location, and timeline of waste disposal projects in developing countries registered with the Clean Development Mechanism as climate offsets. This preliminary case gets at unexpected linkages across climate and waste governance at the international level, and allows us to start to see local impacts of global mitigation and market mechanisms. Using Tableau, we have generated a series of maps and other visualizations that make trends and patterns visible—helping to spark further research. We conclude by discussing the implications of visualization tools for fields of global environmental politics and governance, and critiques of visualization from practical and theoretical viewpoints.

689,"A nitrogen budget model with a user-friendly interface, to assess water renewal rates and nitrogen limitation in commercial seaweed farms","Key factors affecting the economic sustainability of any aquaculture industry and in particular the seaweed industry are its ecological interactions and impacts. Understanding these issues requires an extended production analysis and simulation, given the natural variability and dynamics of external factors that affect those interdependencies. As such, making sense of production data is required for suitable planning and resource optimization in a seaweed farm. The present work calculates the required water renewal rates for seaweed flow-through production units, using a novel simple user-friendly nitrogen budget model. The user interface is straightforward and the model parameter inputs and outputs are minimal, whereby the target users are commercial seaweed farmers. The model was parameterized for production kinetics of Ulva spp. based on an extensive literature survey, and was evaluated with published data on seaweed-growing experiments. Results for the estimated number of volume renewals per day are in agreement with the experimental data. The outputs indicate that this application can be used to estimate the envelope, i.e. average lower and upper ranges for water renewal rates for a given production in a given site. This model and corresponding parameterization for Ulva spp. are available to be used by farmers, managers and researchers in the form of a spreadsheet file (available as Supplementary Material ).

The second situation is where group members are non-cooperative and each member makes every effort to selfishly maximize its own payoff. The decision maker allocates permits to firms according to their non-cooperative game equilibrium scores. Proposed models are applied to study a group of paper mills to analyze their payoffs. The results show that the methods proposed in this work can provide reasonable allocation results for all firms.

Meanwhile, the allocation of carbon emission quota among sectors or enterprises proves the first and critical step. For this reason, this paper constructs a comprehensive index combined with the subjective, objective and linear combination weighting methods to allocate carbon emission quotas among the 39 sectors of China’s industry in 2020 based on the level of 2015, and employs the input-oriented ZSG-DEA model to examine the efficiency of allocation solutions in 2020. The results indicate that, first, when carbon emission reduction capacity, responsibility and potential are considered for the comprehensive index of carbon emission quota allocation, the mitigation responsibility plays a relatively higher role than other two indicators. Second, all of the subjective, objective and linear combination weighting methods can be used for effective allocation of carbon emission quotas, and the former two methods have less advantage in light of efficiency. Third, six key industrial sectors are respectively allocated over 500 million tonnes of carbon emission quotas in 2020, which together account for 91.77 % of the total in the industry.

698,Revisiting the environmental Kuznets curve and pollution haven hypotheses: MIKTA sample,"This study aims to examine the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) and pollution haven hypotheses in Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey, and Australia (MIKTA) countries from 1982 to 2011 by using a panel vector auto regressive (PVAR) model. Empirical findings imply that the EKC hypothesis is rejected by the MIKTA sample. However, PVAR estimations reveal Granger causality from income level, foreign direct investment (FDI) inward, and energy consumption to CO_2 emissions. Orthogonalized impulse-response functions are derived from PVAR estimations. According to the analysis results, the response of CO_2 emissions to a shock on FDI is positive. These results assert that FDI has a detrimental effect on environmental quality in MIKTA countries which means the pollution haven hypothesis is confirmed by the MIKTA sample. Therefore, MIKTA countries should revise their current economic growth plans to provide sustainable development and also re-organize their legal infrastructure to induce usage of renewable energy sources.",2017-08-01,10.1007/s11356-017-9462-y,"['Bakirtas, Ibrahim', 'Cetin, Mumin Atalay']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-017-9462-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
699,"Carbon tax, emission trading, or the mixed policy: which is the most effective strategy for climate change mitigation in China?","China, as the world’s largest emitter, intends to achieve the peaking of carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions around 2030 and to make best efforts to peak early to mitigate global change. Under this strategy, a dynamic, recursive computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is used to analyze the economy, energy, and environment impact of CO_2 emission reduction policy based on 17 scenarios in China: carbon tax, emission trading scheme (ETS), and the mixed policy in different price level, in order to find out which kind of emission reduction strategy is more feasible. The results show that CO_2 emission in 2030 will be reduced with the implementation of tax, ETS and mixed policy, by 10–13 %, 12–14 %, and 18–28 %, respectively. From 2016 to 2030, China can reduce 18,338–24,156 Mt CO_2 through the implementation of mixed policy. Furthermore, relative to single policy, mixed policy has stronger effects on primary energy consumption cut, by 738–1124 Mtoe or 18–28 %, which will make CO_2 emissions reach a peak before 2030 and the peak emission is not greater than 12 billion tons which is in line with the reduction demand in China. Thus, the mixed policy is the most effective strategy so that mixed policy is recommended to parties included in Annex I in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Kyoto Protocol and other countries with large potential of emission reduction, while ETS is suggested to countries with low carbon emissions per capita which can balance economic development and CO_2 mitigation.",2017-08-01,10.1007/s11027-016-9710-3,"['Li, Wei', 'Jia, Zhijie']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-016-9710-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
700,Low-carbon supply policies and supply chain performance with carbon concerned demand,"A dilemma between economic growth and environmental deterioration has never been recognized so seriously until the environmental problem has been impacting everyone’s daily life cogently (e.g., the serious fog and haze in China). Simultaneously, the rising environment awareness of consumers leads to the close attention to the product’s carbon performance reflected in the carbon concerned demand, which provides opportunity to rebuild our business ecosystem. The paper expands the environment view to supply chain operations. A Stackelberg-like model is developed to game-theoretically analyze the decentralized decisions of the manufacturer and retailer. Low-carbon effort is brought into decision by both sides. The centralized decision-making is also investigated as a benchmark to evaluate the supply chain performance. Additionally,we propose a carbon-related price–discount sharing-like scheme to achieve the channel coordination and discuss the possibility of Pareto improvement. Several interesting managerial insights on low-carbon factors are concluded.",2017-08-01,10.1007/s10479-015-1988-0,"['Du, Shaofu', 'Hu, Li', 'Wang, Li']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-015-1988-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

702,"The ETS in China and Europe: dynamics, policy options and global sustainability perspectives","The Emission Trading Schemes of China and Europe show that China’s envisaged national ETS could bring a major contribution in the international approach against global warming; new perspectives on the use of composite sustainability indicators are also highlighted. China’s regional pilot schemes will converge to a (more) uniform price of emission allowances. As China is a major economic and political actor in the world economy, China’s progress with ETS is important. At the same time, China’s progress in the field of green international competitiveness – standing for a positive revealed comparative advantage in environmentally friendly goods – in the period 2000–2015 is considerable and the improved positioning of China in the EIIW-vita sustainability indicator shows considerable technological dynamics in Asia. The European ETS is working, but it suffers from the rather low price of emission allowances. The long-term time horizon of 2050 in the EU climate policy is rather ambitious and it is unclear whether or not a consistent G20 approach can be achieved – with the EU, China, Japan and the US cooperating amongst each other. There is a lack of a specialized climate stabilization institution in the world economy, the traditional anchoring of climate policy in the UN weakens the practical pressure for efficient cooperation since the UN is very heterogeneous in terms of per capita income and GHG emissions per unit of GDP; G20 might be an institution that is suitable for effective policy cooperation.

703,The innovation trajectory of eco-cement in the Netherlands: a co-evolution analysis,"In this article, we scrutinize the innovation trajectory of eco-cement in the Netherlands by examining the innovation nexus of eco-cement manufacturers, scientists/researchers, waste producers and policymakers as part of a broader analysis of markets, policy and society, with special attention to standards and regulations. The influence of policy and innovation interactions are substantiated by policy documents, media news, patterns of eco-cement use, and in-depth interviews conducted with relevant eco-cement actors. Our analysis brings forward empirical evidence of how policymakers are involved in the innovation trajectory of eco-cement in multiple ways through building regulations, sector policies, waste policies, and science and innovation policies. Political economy aspects of regulation and innovation in cement industry (e.g. the cooperative approach of waste authorities with regard to re-use of waste, absence of policies to put a price on CO_2 emissions from cement production) are being described, together with the specificities of the cement market. Bans on the disposal of fly ash and sewage sludge resulted in the use of those materials either as a supplementary cementitious material or a fuel. Demand for green cement from is presently growing but meets with several obstacles. Carbon policies are shown to constitute a weak influence.

704,The Economic and Energy Effects of Carbon Dioxide Emissions Trading in the International Market: New Challenge Conventional Measurement,"Starting from the planned linkage of the European Union’s Emissions Trading System with a new system in Australia in 2015, this paper simulates the impacts of expanding this international emissions market to include China and the USA, which are respectively the largest and second largest carbon dioxide emitters in the world. The findings suggest that including China and the USA significantly impacts the price and the quantity of permits traded worldwide. When China joins the EU-Australia-New Zealand (EU-ANZ)-linked market, we find that the prevailing global carbon market price falls significantly, from $35/tCO_2 to $11.4/tCO_2. In contrast, adding the USA to the EU-ANZ market increases the price to $48/tCO_2. If both China and the USA join the linked market, the market price of an emissions permit is $18.1/tCO_2 and 610 million metric tons are traded, compared to 95 million metric tons in the EU-ANZ scenario. When permit trading between all countries is considered, relative to when all carbon markets operate in isolation, renewable energy in China expands by more than 22 % and shrinks by 50 and 95 % in the USA and ANZ, respectively. In all scenarios, global emissions are reduced by around 5 % relative to a case without climate policies.

705,"The relationship between urbanization, income growth and carbon dioxide emissions and the policy implications for China: a cointegrated vector error correction (VEC) analysis","China is in a phase of rapid urbanization and economic development; in addition, the country’s carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions are increasing. Using a multivariate vector error correction model, this paper investigates the relationship between urbanization, income growth and CO_2 emissions in China. The empirical evidence shows that the three variables are cointegrated, indicating a long-term relationship among urbanization, income growth and CO_2 emissions. Moreover, a Granger causality test reveals that urbanization is the reason for income growth in China. There is also evidence that both urbanization and income growth lead to CO_2 emissions. Hence, authorities should pay more attention to mitigating the negative effects on the environment when developing and implementing policies that promote urbanization and income growth. However, CO_2 emissions do not cause changes in income and urbanization in China. Therefore, China should enforce stricter policies for reducing CO_2 emissions.",2017-06-01,10.1007/s11069-017-2807-5,"['Ma, Xiangrong', 'Ge, Jianping', 'Wang, Wei']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-017-2807-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
706,Evaluating the low-carbon development of urban China,"Facing the ever-increasing serious pollution from carbon emission and the pressing need for sustainable development, China initiated the strategy of low-carbon development in 2010. Since then, eight cities and five provinces have been selected as pilot areas to develop a low-carbon economy. Under such a circumstance, this study aimed to construct a indicator system and evaluating model so that the low-carbon development levels of the pilot cities can be quantified. Therefore, this study, based the on Driving Force–Pressure–State–Impact–Response model, established a regional low-carbon development indicator system. Second, the weight of each indicator was calculated by taking the entropy method. Third, the low-carbon development levels were measured and evaluated by taking the comprehensive approach of Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution. Then, taking 10 cities from those 13 pilot areas as case studies, this study measured and compared the low-carbon development levels of those 10 cities before and after being pilot areas. The research findings showed that though the low-carbon development levels changed greatly, only five pilot cities’ growth rate is positive. The reasons for changes in the low-carbon development levels were analyzed. The urbanization level and energy consumption elasticity coefficient were the main factors affecting the low-carbon development levels. Additionally, the study traced the effective policies hidden behind the indicators, which provided policy insights to help decision makers prepare their low-carbon development strategies, including legislation efforts, economic instrument, renewable energy and energy-saving technology improvement and low-carbon transportation.",2017-06-01,10.1007/s10668-016-9777-8,"['QU, Ying', 'LIU, Yue']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-016-9777-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

This paper examined the casual-relationship between landforms and ground level, `ambient’ carbon dioxide (total 34 points acquired on August 2016). This study employed geographically weighted regression to examine the spatially varying relationships between carbon dioxide, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) patterns and changing trends of landform (elevation, slope) and solar intensity (insolation and duration of sunshine) in Dalseong forestry carbon project site of South Korea. The result reveals that landforms were closely associated with ground CO_2 data (R^2 = 0.952–0.982) and NDVI. Results from these experiments suggest that the ambient CO_2 concentration varies significantly in according to landform and solar intensity forming local vegetation habitat at in situ survey point.

Based on the postulated advantages of OCO-2 satellite transect for multiple nation-wide monitoring, a satellite transect sampling approach has been specifically proposed with focus on administrative region-wide monitoring. This research idea was formulated by incorporating the concept of typical satellite remote sensing into in situ transect techniques. The OCO-2 satellite transect was quite useful in in comparing CO_2 concentrations among administrative regions in Northeast Asia and better understanding the nature and extent of carbon intensity that occurs in transect sampling points. This transect sampling survey made it possible to identify area-wide patterns of CO_2 concentration changing trends subject to many different influences (e.g. the effects of specific sources of land use), which cannot be acquired by typical GHG monitoring satellite such as GOSAT. The OCO-2 satellite transects break down the usual concept of area-wide mapping established as a typical satellite survey technique. The study concludes that OCO-2 satellite transect is demonstrably suitable as a reliable information source for detecting sufficient ground detail CO_2 concentrations, including administrative region monitoring.",2017-06-01,10.1007/s41324-017-0111-9,"['Park, Seong-Il', 'Hwang, Youngseok', 'Um, Jung-Sup']",Spatial Information Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s41324-017-0111-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
709,Relevance of carbon stocks of marine sediments for national greenhouse gas inventories of maritime nations,"Background Determining national carbon stocks is essential in the framework of ongoing climate change mitigation actions. Presently, assessment of carbon stocks in the context of greenhouse gas (GHG)-reporting on a nation-by-nation basis focuses on the terrestrial realm, i.e., carbon held in living plant biomass and soils, and on potential changes in these stocks in response to anthropogenic activities. However, while the ocean and underlying sediments store substantial quantities of carbon, this pool is presently not considered in the context of national inventories. The ongoing disturbances to both terrestrial and marine ecosystems as a consequence of food production, pollution, climate change and other factors, as well as alteration of linkages and C-exchange between continental and oceanic realms, highlight the need for a better understanding of the quantity and vulnerability of carbon stocks in both systems. We present a preliminary comparison of the stocks of organic carbon held in continental margin sediments within the Exclusive Economic Zone of maritime nations with those in their soils. Our study focuses on Namibia, where there is a wealth of marine sediment data, and draws comparisons with sediment data from two other countries with different characteristics, which are Pakistan and the United Kingdom. Results Results indicate that marine sediment carbon stocks in maritime nations can be similar in magnitude to those of soils. Therefore, if human activities in these areas are managed, carbon stocks in the oceanic realm—particularly over continental margins—could be considered as part of national GHG inventories. Conclusions This study shows that marine sediment organic carbon stocks can be equal in size or exceed terrestrial carbon stocks of maritime nations. This provides motivation both for improved assessment of sedimentary carbon inventories and for reevaluation of the way that carbon stocks are assessed and valued. The latter carries potential implications for the management of human activities on coastal environments and for their GHG inventories.",2017-05-10,10.1186/s13021-017-0077-x,"['Avelar, Silvania', 'Voort, Tessa S.', 'Eglinton, Timothy I.']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13021-017-0077-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Results showed a positive monotonic relationship between income and CO_2 emissions. All models do not support the EKC hypothesis which assumes an inverted U-shaped relationship between income and environmental degradation. Financial development has a long-run negative impact on carbon emissions, implying that financial development minimizes environmental degradation.

This study disaggregated the international trade into total exports and total imports. A multivariate model framework was estimated for the time series data for the period of 1970–2014. The quantile regression detected all the essential relationship, which hitherto, the traditional ordinary least squares could not capture. A cointegration relationship was confirmed using the Johansen cointegration model. The findings of the Granger causality revealed the presence of a uni-directional Granger causality running from energy consumption to economic growth; from import to economic growth; from imports to exports; and from urbanisation to economic growth, exports and imports. Our study established the presence of long-run relationships amongst carbon dioxide emission, economic growth, energy consumption, imports, exports and urbanisation. A bootstrap method was further utilised to reassess the evidence of the Granger causality, of which the results affirmed the Granger causality in the long run. This study confirmed a long-run N -shaped relationship between economic growth and carbon emission, under the estimated cubic environmental Kuznet curve framework, from the perspective of China. The recommendation therefore is that China as export leader should transform its trade growth mode by reducing the level of carbon dioxide emission and strengthening its international cooperation as it embraces more environmental protectionisms.",2017-05-01,10.1007/s11356-017-8955-z,"['Boamah, Kofi Baah', 'Du, Jianguo', 'Bediako, Isaac Asare', 'Boamah, Angela Jacinta', 'Abdul-Rasheed, Alhassan Alolo', 'Owusu, Samuel Mensah']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-017-8955-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
712,Carbon Trading Reporting: The Case of Spanish Companies,"Policy makers, scientists, industry leaders, and academicians all have debated how to restrain global warming and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Three main methods are used: command and control laws and regulations, carbon taxes, and cap and trade schemes. Recognizing the consequences of global warming, all Scandinavian countries introduced a carbon emissions tax in the 1990s. They also ratified the Kyoto Protocol that ran from 2005 through 2012. The European Union (EU) instituted a carbon trading scheme (Emissions Trading System (ETS)) in February 2005 when Kyoto became operative. The three Scandinavian EU members had two methods in place during the 2005–08 period to encourage GHG reduction: taxing and trading. Norway, not in the EU, used just taxes. The other EU members, including Spain, applied just the carbon trading ETS scheme to encourage compliance with the Kyoto Protocol. The fundamental issue addressed is this one: Did publicly held firms headquartered in Spain adequately report participation in the EU carbon emissions trading mechanism? Data to answer this question were obtained from the 2011 and 2012 annual reports for domestic Spanish public companies that received tradable emissions permits. In addition to assessing investor-owned firms’ disclosure posture, the specific method of reporting about carbon emissions permits, whether companies used, banked, or sold the permits granted by the government, also is reviewed. This empirical research effort reports on a complete survey of all available data for the two financial reporting periods that concluded the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol.",2017-05-01,10.1007/s11294-017-9634-z,"['Stagliano, A.

713,"Taking climate, land use, and social economy into estimation of carbon budget in the Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Region of China","Carbon sequestration is an indispensable ecosystem service provided by soil and vegetation, so mapping and valuing the carbon budget by considering both ecological and social factors is an important trend in evaluating ecosystem services. In this work, we established multiple scenarios to evaluate the impacts of land use change, population growth, carbon emission per capita, and carbon markets on carbon budget. We quantified carbon sinks (aboveground and belowground) under different scenarios, using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model and an improved carbon cycle process model, and studied carbon sources caused by human activities by analyzing the spatial distribution of human population and carbon emission per capita. We also assessed the net present value (NPV) for carbon budgets under different carbon price and discount rate scenarios using NPV model. Our results indicate that the carbon budget of Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Region is surplus: Carbon sinks range from 1.50 × 10^10 to 1.54 × 10^10 t, while carbon sources caused by human activities range from 2.76 × 10^5 to 7.60 × 10^5 t. And the NPV for carbon deficits range from 3.20 × 10^11 RMB to 1.52 × 10^12 RMB. From the perspective of ecological management, deforestation, urban sprawl, population growth, and excessive carbon consumption are considered as the main challenges in balancing carbon sources and sinks.

716,Allocation and simulation study of carbon emission quotas among China’s provinces in 2020,"China will form its carbon market in 2017 to focus on the allocation of regional carbon emission quota in order to cope with global warming. The rationality of the regional allocation has become an important consideration for the government in ensuring stable growth in different regions that are experiencing disparity in resource endowment and economic status. Based on constructing the quota allocation indicator system for carbon emission, the emission quota for each province in different scenarios and schemes in 2020 is simulated by the multifactor hybrid weighted Shannon entropy allocation model. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) The top 5 secondary-level indicators that influence provincial quota allocation in weight are as follows: per capita energy consumption, openness, per capita carbon emission, per capita disposable income, and energy intensity. (2) The ratio of carbon emission in 2020 is different from that in 2013 in many scenarios, and the variation is scenario 2 > scenario 1 > scenario 3, with Hubei and Guangdong the provinces with the largest increase and decrease ratios, respectively. (3) In the same scenario, the quota allocation varies in different reduction criteria emphases; if the government emphasizes reduction efficiency, scheme 1 will show obvious adjustment, that is, Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, and Yunnan will have the largest decrease.

717,Are decisions well supported for the energy transition? A review on modeling approaches for renewable energy policy evaluation,"This study reviews energy policy evaluation approaches on their capability to estimate a successful implementation of renewable energy policies. This is predominantly done via energy system modeling and analysis. Although modeling the possible success and effects is not a precondition for policy making, it is a powerful tool to support decision makers in policy making. This awareness has led to the development of numerous modeling approaches with many case studies. Therefore, effort has to be made to evaluate recent modeling approaches that could be suitable for renewable energy policy evaluation. It is the aim of this paper to provide an overview on recent renewable energy policy modeling approaches that are capable in evaluating the success and side effects to other sectors of renewable energy policies. We will highlight advantages and drawbacks of these approaches and provide a framework assessing the suitability of the presented methodologies for the evaluation of renewable energy policies. We provide a tabular overview that enables the reader to quickly derive information on the suitability of the several modeling approaches to evaluate renewable energy policies.",2017-02-20,10.1186/s13705-017-0107-2,"['Horschig, Thomas', 'Thrän, Daniela']","Energy, Sustainability and Society",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13705-017-0107-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
718,International Carbon Trade and National Taxes: Distributional Impacts of Double Regulation,"This paper focuses on carbon emissions control in a group of countries to explore the distributional incidence of mixed policies consisting of a joint emissions trading scheme (ETS) and of national emissions taxes overlapping with the ETS. Such policies impact on national welfares through both the overlapping taxes and the distribution of national emissions caps. First, we consider the polar case of an emissions tax-only policy and show that the equilibrium allocation is unaffected by the introduction of an ETS with an arbitrarily given distribution of emissions caps. Next, we analyze the distributional consequences of mixed policies. We characterize those mixed policies, including the polar cases of ETS-only and tax-only policies, which bring about the same distribution of national welfares. We also suggest two measures of the net distributional incidence of mixed policies which allow to identify winners and losers of mixed policies relative to the tax-only policy.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-49442-5_13,"['Eichner, Thomas', 'Pethig, Rüdiger']",The Theory of Externalities and Public Goods,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-49442-5_13,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
719,Achieving Carbon Emissions Peak in China by 2030: The Key Options and Economic Impacts,"This study investigates the options and sectors that are essential for China to achieve carbon emissions peak by 2030. A dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is used to generate 14 scenarios from a scenario matrix incorporating three levels of carbon constraints and four options of low-carbon measures. Results suggest that if there is no policy intervention, China’s total CO_2 emissions would reach 22.9 Gt in 2030. To cut carbon emissions required by the latest Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) or the global two-degree target, China should not only rely on optimizing industry structure or restricting its industry output, but more importantly, it should rely on low-carbon technologies in the power and end-use sectors as well as low-carbon style consumption. We also depict how the mitigation costs can be lowered through various low-carbon countermeasures, with which the carbon mitigation cost of achieving China’s INDC target in 2030 could be reduced from 155 USD/ton-CO_2 to 35 USD/ton-CO_2. The corresponding GDP loss could fall from 6.3% to merely 0.67%, and welfare will not be affected significantly.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-981-10-3869-3_6,"['Dai, Hancheng', 'Masui, Toshihiko']",Post-2020 Climate Action,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-10-3869-3_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
720,Emissions Trading,"Climate change is being exacerbated by the emissions of globe-warming greenhouse gases (GHGs) as a consequence of economic activities associated with energy, industry, transportation, and land use. From an economic viewpoint, the Earth’s climate is a public good , and pollution a negative externality ; such change therefore constitutes market failure . Controlling air pollution by utilizing economic mechanisms represents an important change in environmental thinking – literally a paradigm shift away from historical command-and-control engineering systems. Today, this approach is being utilized to mitigate the emissions of GHGs, addressing the pollution externality by putting a price on carbon. The international carbon market, largely developed as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, had a total value of $176 billion in 2011, but it has decreased significantly in recent years. With the addition of China and other national and subnational programs, however, it is expected that it will once again increase, as a larger and larger portion of emitted GHGs come under such regulatory purview. Historically, the largest component of that market has been the European Union’s Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which represents a regional market designed first to assist Europe in achieving compliance with the Protocol’s requirements, and now is a cornerstone of the EU’s policy to combat climate change. It also has links to the Protocol’s project-based mechanisms, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI), which help minimize compliance costs. China’s nascent market – currently seven pilot schemes, but expected to become a national program in 2016 – should ultimately become twice as large as the EU ETS. Other carbon markets created in numerous countries (e.g., the U.S., Japan, South Korea, etc.) as well as a voluntary market are also expected to make significant contributions. This chapter discusses the structure of these emissions trading carbon markets, the theory behind their development, their historical evolution, ongoing governance challenges, and future prospects.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_8,"['Raufer, Roger', 'Coussy, Paula', 'Freeman, Carla', 'Iyer, Sudha']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
721,Carbon Markets: Linking the International Emission Trading Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS),"The trading of carbon emission permits is an instrument created recently to tackle the climate change problem. From 2005 onward, in particular, the volume and significance of different carbon emission trading schemes have increased spectacularly; despite the fact that new emission trading schemes are appearing, the value of the market had fallen by the end of the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period in 2012. One fundamental reason for this was the uncertainty as to whether a new global agreement or protocol would be reached in 2015. The main goal of this chapter is to offer an overview of International Emission Trading under the Kyoto Protocol together with the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), as the schemes at the core of today’s carbon markets, exploring their basic structure, their main links, and their differences, including a carbon price analysis underlining their fundamental weaknesses and strengths.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_57,"['Alegría, Itziar Martínez', 'Molina, Gonzalo', 'Río, Belén']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_57,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
722,SNA Based Identification of Key Factors Affecting the Implementation of Emission Trading System (ETS) in Building Sector: A Study in the Context of China,"Emission Trading System (ETS) has been promoted as a tool for providing financial and cost-effective incentives to the GHG emitters to implement emission reduction measures. The ETS has been applied in many energy-intensive industries internationally. However, its implementation in building sector appears encountering many challenges due to the unique characteristics of buildings. This study attempts to identify and analyze the key factors within the context of China. Research data are from semi-structured interviews with a selected group of ETS experts from official and academia. Fifteen representative factors have been identified from extensive content analysis and validated with experts’ opinions. Among these representative factors, some are key factors playing critical and essential roles. This paper applies the Social Network Analysis (SNA) to find the key factors. Finally, it is found that there are four factors considered as the most important influence factors, including “government”, “emitters”, “the scattered energy consumption and carbon emission in building sector”, and “decentralization of property rights in building sector”. The findings from the study provide valuable reference for decision-making in promoting ETS in those developing countries such as China where carbon emission in building sector contributes considerably to environmental pollution.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-981-10-0855-9_52,"['Song, Xiangnan', 'Shen, Liyin', 'Yam, Michael C.

723,Research on the initial allocation of carbon emission quotas: evidence from China,"In November 2015, China government announced that the national carbon emissions trading market is expected to start in 2017. Carbon emission trading system is a raising concern from day to day, in which the allocation of carbon quotas has the closest relationship with trading units directly determining the cost of carbon trading. Initial allowance allocation is fundamental, but it proposes difficulty in terms of the trading mechanism design. This paper is based on the total control principle of national layout, in which the government sets up the cap of emissions in the carbon emissions trading system and focuses on the historical emission allocation concept from the perspective of fairness and history responsibility meaning that the allocation of quota in the future is based on the historical emissions. Firstly, we carry out comparative analysis based on the economy development and the emissions of 31 provinces and cities in China and select the sign-post province, Hebei. Secondly, we take the sign-post province as benchmarking and compare the benchmarking with the other provinces on the economy to set three quota situations of different initial years. Finally, we conduct quota calculation of residual carbon dioxide of various provinces by the end of 2020 and provide the specific quota calculation plans under different situations. The result of quota indicates: Most provinces still have more or less surplus to reallocate by the end of 2020; some provinces and cities have developing economy at expense of large emission and old industrial area with high energy consumption and high coal demand are in the shortage of future emission space; for the developed areas, the earlier emissions accounting is not good for their owning surplus; the earlier the years we select as the starting to account the quota, the greater the reductions space we will have. Meanwhile, we carry out testing of the feasibility of self-providing quota plans. These results may provide corresponding policy advice for China.",2017-01-01,10.1007/s11069-016-2628-y,"['Hu, Yu-Jie', 'Han, Rong', 'Tang, Bao-Jun']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-016-2628-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
724,Sustainable Operations of Closed-Loop Logistics Chain from an Economic and Environmental Performance Perspective,"With increasingly scarce global resources, gradually worsening waste emissions, and rising environmental protection awareness, an increasing number of countries enacted strict regulations to protect the environment; in addition, the issues on recycling and reusing used products have caught worldwide attention. Adapting to environmental protection and consumer requirements has compelled manufacturers and distributors to formulate forward and reverse logistics networks (RLNs) simultaneously. Moreover, the increasingly transparent contradiction between the supply and demand of resources coincides with the enterprises’ experience of growing cost pressures, for which recycling and remanufacturing gradually became important techniques to reduce the production cost. Under this background, the closed-loop logistics (CLL) has received significant attention from the academia and industry. In this chapter, we defined the related concepts with CLL; proposed the theoretical framework, including the CLL network structure and sustainable operations of logistics; and analyzed the effect of CLL on manufacturing, services, and people’s lives with a special focus on the main sustainable operations, namely, recycling and remanufacturing. The results revealed that implementing CLL management became a strategic choice for many enterprises, with its vital significance to decrease waste emissions, protect the environment, reduce production costs, improve economic efficiency, enhance competitiveness, promote enterprise technology innovation, and strengthen environmental protection.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-65338-9_7,"['Liu, B.

725,The Effectiveness of the International Emissions Trading under the Paris Agreement,"Under the Paris Agreement, parties would set and implement their own emissions targets as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to tackle climate change risk. The international carbon emissions trading (ET) is expected to reduce global mitigation costs. Here we show the benefit of ET under both NDCs. The results show that the global welfare loss, which was measured based on estimated household consumption change in 2030, decreased by 80% (from 0.5 to 0.1%), as a consequence of achieving the NDCs through ET. These results indicate that ET is a valuable option for the international system, enabling the NDCs to be cost-effectively achieved and more ambitious targets.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-981-10-3869-3_5,"['Fujimori, Shinichiro', 'Kubota, Izumi', 'Dai, Hancheng', 'Takahashi, Kiyoshi', 'Hasegawa, Tomoko', 'Liu, Jing-Yu', 'Hijioka, Yasuaki', 'Masui, Toshihiko', 'Takimi, Maho']",Post-2020 Climate Action,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-10-3869-3_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
726,Who gains from technological advancement? The role of policy design when cost development for key abatement technologies is uncertain,"A simple model is used to illustrate the effects of a reduction in (marginal) abatement cost in a two-country setting. It can be shown that a country experiencing a cost reduction can actually be worse off. This holds true for a variety of quantity and price-based emission policies. Under price-based policies, a country with lower abatement costs might engage in additional abatement effort for which it is not compensated. Under a quantity-based policy with a given allocation, a seller of permits can also be negatively affected by a lower carbon price. We also argue that abatement cost shocks to renewable energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) are different in terms of their effects on international energy markets. A shock to renewable energy benefits energy importers because the value of fossil fuels is reduced. The opposite holds for a shock to CCS which benefits energy exporters. The channels identified in the theoretical model can be confirmed in a more complex global computable general equilibrium model. Some regions are indeed worse off from a shock that lowers their abatement costs.",2017-01-01,10.1007/s10018-016-0142-9,"['Weitzel, Matthias']",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10018-016-0142-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
727,The Mitigation Alliance Target and Its Distribution,"Misalignment between the Paris Agreement (PA) objectives and its implementation tools represents the biggest challenge for its implementation. The compromise between top-down urgencies, such as the 2/1.5 °C target, and bottom-up stances, such as the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) pledge-and-review system removed years of efforts for identifying effective and equitable systems to combat climate change, threatening the same signification of the Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) principle. The Mitigation Alliance (MA) proposed in this book offers a feasible alternative to the current system. It applies to entities that voluntarily collaborate under the framework of the PA’s Article 6 (A6PA) and entails the establishment of an aggregate Net Zero Carbon (NZC) target for the MA and a technical, flexible distribution of the corresponding mitigation burden. While the NZC is based on scientific evidence, the hereby-proposed distribution system represents a key innovation. By introducing a dynamic formula for distributing the mitigation burden (or quota) among its members, the MA aligns ambition with the PA’s objectives while taking full account of the CBDR-RC principle.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-54699-5_5,"['Stua, Michele', 'Coulon, Michele']",From the Paris Agreement to a Low-Carbon Bretton Woods,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-54699-5_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
728,Smart Cities: Case Studies,"This chapter shows some examples of smart cities.

The chapter is divided into four main paragraphs. The newly built cities, in the Middle East paragraph, are cities where everything has been planned from scratch on white paper to limit emissions and increase the quality of life of citizens. In the paragraphs about the North-European cities and the Mediterranean cities, the cities with strong historic value are described. In this section, many European cities, which have specific features like limited possibility to apply technology, but still an adequate level of development to understand and correctly implement the ICT driven choices are described with reference to the smart city concept. The last paragraph shows some example of “developing city” that often are cities with low awareness about sustainable settlement issues, but with a great economic and social growth. These are, in most cases, eastern cities; they show a great potential and are gradually, within the world community, trying to create the basis to become leaders of smart cities development.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-47361-1_3,"['Riva Sanseverino, Eleonora', 'Riva Sanseverino, Raffaella', 'Vaccaro, Valentina', 'Macaione, Ina', 'Anello, Enrico']",Smart Cities Atlas,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-47361-1_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

733,Fighting for Coal: Public Relations and the Campaigns Against Lower Carbon Pollution Policies in Australia,"This chapter explores the public relations strategies used by the mining and energy lobby to defeat climate change policy agendas with which they disagree, and discusses three Australian case studies where these strategies were implemented to maximum effect. The first concerns the Labor government’s attempt to implement a carbon emissions trading scheme, while the second case study explores the ‘charm offensive’ run by the mining and energy sector to cultivate strategic alliances and allies to prevent future legislative challenges. The third case study concerns a second Labor government’s efforts to implement a carbon tax and the mining industry’s powerful backlash against it. Together, these case studies demonstrate that the mining and energy sector uses a ‘reward and punishment’ strategy that can make it difficult for governments to enact legislation to reduce carbon emissions.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-57876-7_10,"['McKnight, David', 'Hobbs, Mitchell']",Carbon Capitalism and Communication,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-57876-7_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

735,Markets Are not Created Equal,"Markets are assumed by the logic of capital budgeting to be homogeneous. For this reason, differences in market structures, scale, complexities, connectivity, and administrative approaches are assumed to be value neutral or inconsequential. This chapter illustrates that these factors influence the sequencing of commitments and shows the differing impacts they have on a firm’s performance (or policy outcomes). When market structures and competition are considered, monopolists tend to defer commitments until the option premium is significantly high, in the absence of pre-emption threats. However, increasing competition encourages firms to exercise early in order to lock in payoffs that could otherwise be lost to rivals—a classic prisoner’s dilemma. Managerial capabilities differ according to the strength of subsidies’ rent-extractive bias, through the exercise of strategic choices. Managers abdicate their technology choices decisions to policy under regimes of generous subsidies. Carbon taxation uses pricing signals to influence the types or mix of supplies that managers may eventually choose. Two policy experiences are examined: Australia’s failed programme is contrasted with Canada’s relatively viable experiments in British Columbia.",2017-01-01,10.1057/978-1-137-59139-5_9,"['Barcelona, Ricardo G.']",Energy Investments,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/978-1-137-59139-5_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

739,Coastal Mangrove Forests: Micro-Geopolitics of Resistance and Social Innovation for Environmental Sustainability,"This chapter argues that at the heart of social innovation for environmental sustainability are the issues of space, scale, and power, which present themselves in the form of various puzzles, especially when approached in the context of climate change. Since communities are the basic building blocks of “social” they remain central to “social innovation.” Taking as its key examples the Indian Sundarbans in the Bay of Bengal and Zhangjiangkou Mangrove Forestry National Nature Reserve in Yunxiao county of Fujian province of China, the chapter shows how communities located on sites characterized by multiple marginalities (geographical, socioeconomic, and cultural) perceive and approach impacts of environmental unsustainability and incremental climate change in both material-physical and ideational-representational terms. Environmental sustainability, both on land and at sea, is unlikely to be realized in the absence of a pursuit of social innovation through a micro-geopolitics of resistance anchored in participatory democracy and environmental-social justice.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-44037-8_8,"['Chaturvedi, Sanjay']",Environmental Sustainability from the Himalayas to the Oceans,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-44037-8_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

741,Cities and the Changing Nature of International Governance,"This chapter examines the various types of international engagement by cities and city-regions, and the impact that has had on the constellation, operation and explanation of global governance. This involves identifying the key issues in emerging understandings of, and theoretical perspectives on, new international relationships. Particular attention will be given to the variations that emerge in the analysis and explanation of global governance, as well as different perspectives on network governance and its varying scales. In addition, the utility of the multi-level governance perspective will be examined, and ideas about regime formation through international networking as the increasingly more widespread mode of governing. From this discussion we move on to a second set of questions about understanding the rationales behind new international imaginaries of power, opportunity and interdependencies, as well as, importantly for the democratic systems examined here, questions of authority and legitimacy in the emerging new, and increasingly complex, multi-scalar and multi-actor forms of global governance.",2017-01-01,10.1057/978-1-137-39617-4_3,"['Herrschel, Tassilo', 'Newman, Peter']",Cities as International Actors,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/978-1-137-39617-4_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

743,Convex contractive interval linear programming for resources and environmental systems management,"It is likely that the most reliable estimation of system uncertainty in resources and environmental systems management ( RESM ) is a value range with an unknown distribution. Stochastic programming would be challenged by distortion of the original uncertain information through fabricating an inexistent probabilistic distribution function. Instead, interval linear programming ( ILP ), i.e. a synthesis of interval-set coefficients and the conventional linear programming, has been employed to identify the desired schemes for a number of RESM problems under interval uncertainty. However, its effectiveness is disabled by constraint violation which may lead to severe penalties on socio-economic or eco-environmental development. To mitigate such a challenge, a convex contractive interval linear programming ( CCILP ) approach is proposed in this study. It mainly consists of six modules: parameterizing an RESM problem as an ILP model, initializing a hyperrectangle decision space by two linear programming sub-models, revealing causes of constraint violation given a criterion, inferring feasibilities of potential solutions, finalizing a feasible hyperrectangle decision space by another linear programming sub-model, and supporting RESM of various complexities through alternative variants. A simple ILP model for RESM is introduced to demonstrate the procedures of CCILP and verify its advantages over existing ILP methods. The result indicates that CCILP is capable of robustly incorporating interval uncertainties into the optimization process, avoiding heavy computation burdens on complicated sub-models, eliminating occurrence of constraint violation, enabling provision of a hyperrectangle decision space, adapting to diverse system requirements, and increasing reliability of decision support for interval linear RESM problems.",2017-01-01,10.1007/s00477-015-1187-1,"['Cheng, Guanhui', 'Huang, Guohe', 'Dong, Cong']",Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00477-015-1187-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
744,Storytelling and Changing Values,"Online campaigning organisations share a commitment to a storytelling and values-led strategy, often understood as a “theory of change” approach. Storytelling is a recognised social movement device and analytical approach for explaining politics via cause and effect relations, through a retelling of a detailed story rather than by appeals to primarily logic and evidence. Stories focus more on how language or rhetoric are used, and reveal the underlying “common sense” and emotional frames used in the delivery of political messages. Online campaigning organisations use a storytelling approach to build their own autobiographical story, or brand, that differentiates what they do from: “politics as usual”, that is, party-based, adversarial politics.

745,Biorefineries: Industrial-Scale Production Paving the Way for Bioeconomy,"The development and application of industrial-scale conversion procedures in high-yielding and cost-efficient production facilities is a vital endeavor to successfully implement bioeconomy and produce valuable products such as biofuels and platform chemicals from biomass and derived wastes in a sustainable manner. Such effort is expected to benefit various strategic sectors mainly related to energy security by gradually reducing the dependency on fossil fuels (which will appease many geopolitical tensions around the world) and the mitigation of various environmental issues such as global warming and toxic wastes and emissions. The facilities where such sustainable bio-based production processes are operated are referred to as biorefineries. In this chapter, various categories of biorefineries are reported (green, whole grain, lignocellulosic biomass, oleo-chemical, and marine biorefineries), along with the related strategies and technologies. Considering the strategic importance of such production facilities in the bioeconomy concept, several issues and challenges are also presented and discussed with respect to both the design and operation of biorefineries. The urgent need for a wider expansion plan of biorefineries well implemented in their local environments (sustainable management of biomass, water, and energy resources) is also highlighted. Besides, two commercially available biorefining technologies are reported in order to represent the biorefining technological know-how in Europe (Borregaard, Norway) and Northern America (Envergent Technologies, Canada/United States).",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-55637-6_7,"['Sillanpää, Mika', 'Ncibi, Chaker']",A Sustainable Bioeconomy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-55637-6_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
746,Non-economic and Non-commercial Fundamentals,"Natural gas is a natural product, consisting mainly of methane (CH_4), whereby the state depends on temperature Temperature , pressure, specific volume, and its chemical composition. Compressed natural gas (CNG) is produced from natural gas by compression to approximately 200 bar. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that is cooled down to approximately −161.5 °C where methane liquefies. Propane and butane are also referred to as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) . Together with ethane, LPGs, pentanes, and higher hydrocarbons are usually referred to as natural gas liquids (NGL) Natural gas liquids (NGL) . The most important parameters describing the combustion properties of natural gas are (gross) calorific value and Wobbe index Wobbe index . All gas-fired equipment and applications are designed (and sometimes fine-tuned) for a particular natural gas quality Quality . Gas specifications are necessary to define the minimum quality requirements that natural gas has to fulfil. Production and use of natural gas has an impact on the environment. These environmental effects might be categorized according to the part of the ecosystem influenced. Climate effects, air pollution, water Water pollution, and land use do occur. In general, natural gas combusts cleaner than other fossil fuels. The source material for natural gas genesis is organic matter, e.g., marine microorganisms like algae. Natural gas fields are commercially recoverable accumulations of natural gas in the Earth’s crust. Conventional natural gas fields are not found in source rocks Source rock , but in reservoir rock Reservoir rock s. A source rock is a sedimentary rock in which petroleum and natural gas are formed. A reservoir rock is generally any porous and permeable rock containing hydrocarbons. Reservoir rocks are predominantly sedimentary (sandstones and carbonates). Other than conventional reservoirs Reservoir , which allow for economic production without massive stimulation treatments, unconventional sources show usually quite low permeabilities and can therefore only be produced at economic flow rates with the assistance of large stimulation treatments and special recovery technologies. Unconventional sources are tight gas sands, shale gas Shale gas , and coal-bed methane. Anthropogenic production of ‘natural’ gas delivers biogas and coal gas. Natural gas offers a wide range of applications. In the residential and commercial segment, natural gas is mainly used for cooking, heating Heating , and cooling. In the industrial Industrial segment, natural gas might be used for heating or as chemical feedstock. Technologies to produce electricity from natural gas in centralized power plants Power plant are steam turbines, combustion turbines, and combined cycles. Furthermore, natural gas is used in the transportation sector.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-53249-3_4,"['Pustišek, Andrej', 'Karasz, Michael']",Natural Gas: A Commercial Perspective,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-53249-3_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

This research focuses on some product supply chain to make a literature review-based investigation on proposing a theoretical framework. We also solve potential research issues of how diverse carbon emission regulations can work on supply chain performance as well as emission; in what way we can find coordination mechanisms and optimal policies for supply chain operations to abate emission and enhance system profitability within different scenarios; and also to evaluate the effect on emission reduction for each emission regulation aforementioned through comparing their associated supply chain performances and system emission. Both practitioners in industry and academia might find this study useful, as it generates concepts with a formal framework of potential and values theoretical issues in the emerging field of carbon-efficient supply chain management which combines carbon emission regulations with mature operation management to enrich the theory of supply chain management.

752,Optimal pricing of the Taiwan carbon trading market based on a demand–supply model,"This study establishes theoretical models of supply and demand for carbon trading and proposes conditions for optimal trading prices and periods. Taiwan’s carbon market is used to verify the validity of the models. Simulations and empirical analysis position firms that emit greenhouse gases as the market buyers, and landowners that convert agricultural lands into plantation forests as the market sellers. The study compares four trading scenarios to determine optimal trading prices and time periods. There were four key conclusions. First, the higher the buyer’s cost to reduce carbon emissions, the higher the demand price is in the carbon trading market. The longer the trading period, the higher the carbon offsets, and the higher the demand price is for emissions trading. Second, the higher the emission trading price, the longer the optimal forest rotation period is for landowners. If emission costs do not exist at the time of logging, landowners are encouraged to log early, reducing the length of rotation periods. Furthermore, as the extension period in the trading scenarios increases, landowners’ costs increase, raising the market equilibrium price. Third, when landowners participate in forest carbon trading mechanisms or carbon subsidy policies, they may not always lengthen forest rotation periods. Therefore, if and when the government implements these mechanisms or policies, it should consider the factors affecting the length of forest rotation period. Finally, to respond to international interest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the government should design separate carbon programs and trading mechanisms for different types of private landowners. This would strengthen incentives for participating in the afforestation program.",2016-11-01,10.1007/s11069-015-2093-z,"['Liu, Wan-Yu', 'Wang, Qunwei']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-015-2093-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

The calculation results showed the total carbon emission of export experienced an increase before 2007 and then a decrease till 2010. The ratio of export embodied carbon accounting for the total carbon emission in China also increased from 31 % in 2002 to 52 % in 2007 and then declined to 40 % in 2010. As for distribution, the export embodied carbon emission of the following industries such as machinery and equipment manufacturing, metal products manufacturing industry, chemical industry, textile, clothing and leather products manufacturing industry ranked the highest. According to the calculation and analysis of the main driving factors of embodied carbon growth, we analyzed the structure effect, scale effect and technological effect’s influence on embodied carbon growth, respectively. We also calculated the trade competitiveness index of 17 export industries. Through research, we found that the products with strong international competitiveness belong to high-carbon-emission categories, which was the main reason of high carbon emission in China export.

754,Initial carbon quota allocation methods of power sectors: a China case study,"China intends to launch the national trade system of carbon emissions in 2017. Assigning the initial quotas properly under the fixed overall amount for the power sectors which are the main members contained in the trade system is one of the most difficult and important parts. The purpose of this paper was to achieve a fair allocation as far as possible. After analyzing the carbon emissions from thermal power generation among all 30 provinces in China, this paper sets the mixed quota allocation method which is most proper for each province, taking the survival and development into account. The zero sum gains DEA model (hereinafter referred to as ZSG-DEA) is used to evaluate the efficiency of production with given initial quota. The result indicates that the emissions of power sectors take more than 40 % in all. Moreover, the more the thermal power is, the more emissions would be. The mixed quota allocation method could make 76 % of province be in the status of normal operation. Moreover, the average efficiency of the project reaches 83.38 %; meanwhile, all 30 provinces could reach DEA efficiency by three adjustments of iterations.

755,Comparative analysis of the international carbon verification policies and systems,"Carbon verification, which can guarantee the reliability and credibility of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission data, is the most important part of the daily operations of the carbon emission right trading system. Many international institutions, countries and regions have conducted research on and have practiced carbon verification policies and systems. Through comparative analysis of the international carbon verification policies and systems, they can provide experience for Chinese unified national carbon market to start supporting carbon verification. The paper study concludes that (1) carbon verification systems developed by international institutions focus on the scientific level of verification methods; (2) carbon verification policies and systems issued by important countries and regions draw on International Standardization Organization (ISO)14064 standards based on their national conditions and focus on the scientific level and reasonableness of verification methods; (3) major international experience includes complete verification policies and systems, strict standard verification procedures, diversified verification forms and a focus on key emission sources. Based on the differences in China’s carbon emissions characteristics caused by unbalanced regional economic development and the conditions of carbon verification in seven pilot carbon trading areas, this thesis proposes the following suggestions: pushing forward the establishment of carbon verification policies and systems by accelerating legislation on climate changes; facilitating carbon verification in a coordinated manner; regulating key GHG emission sources; establishing and improving supervision on carbon verification; and intensifying international exchanges and cooperation.",2016-11-01,10.1007/s11069-016-2593-5,"['Wang, Jianfu', 'Jin, Shiping', 'Bai, Weiguo', 'Li, Yongliang', 'Jin, Yuhui']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-016-2593-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
756,Approaches to carbon allowance allocation in China: a computable general equilibrium analysis,"China is preparing to develop and implement an emissions trading system in its 13th five-year plan. Allowance allocation is one of the key issues to settle during the establishment of this system. This study applies the China Energy and Environmental Policy Analysis model to assess how the allowances should be allocated. Simulation results show that, while impacts on China’s economic development vary according to how allowances are allocated, the negative impacts cannot be mitigated completely, which are between −0.5 and −0.1 % when 5 % of carbon emissions are reduced. In terms of the impacts on the macroeconomy, sectoral output, and capital revenue, results suggest that auctioning the allowances and recycling the revenue to reduce the indirect tax will perform best in alleviating the negative impacts. Meanwhile, impacts of carbon mitigation on international competitiveness can be reduced most in the approach where only key energy- and trade-intensive sectors are able to receive free allowances. However, if citizens’ welfare and quality of life is prioritized, auctioning the allowance and transferring the revenue to households in proportion to their occupation will be the most effective approach; in this case, the negative impacts on rural households’ disposable incomes and welfare will be reduced, and the income gap between rural and urban households will be narrowed.",2016-11-01,10.1007/s11069-016-2352-7,"['Yao, Yun-Fei', 'Liang, Qiao-Mei']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-016-2352-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
757,Target setting and allocation of carbon emissions abatement based on DEA and closest target: an application to 20 APEC economies,"Regarded as an effective method for treating the global warming problem, carbon emissions abatement (CEA) allocation has become a hot research topic and has drawn great attention recently. However, the traditional CEA allocation methods generally set efficient targets for the decision-making units (DMUs) using the farthest targets, which neglects the DMUs’ unwillingness to maximize (minimize) some of their inputs (outputs). In addition, the total CEA level is usually subjectively determined without any consideration of the current carbon emission situations of the DMUs. To surmount these deficiencies, we incorporate data envelopment analysis and its closest target technique into the CEA allocation problem. Firstly, a two-stage approach is proposed for setting the optimal total CEA level for the DMUs. Then, another two-stage approach is given for allocating the identified optimal total CEA among the DMUs. Our approach provides more flexibility when setting new input and output targets for the DMUs in CEA allocation. Finally, the proposed approaches are applied for CEA target setting and allocation for 20 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation economies.",2016-11-01,10.1007/s11069-015-1973-6,"['Wu, Jie', 'Chu, Jun-Fei', 'Liang, Liang']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-015-1973-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
758,Economic and environmental effects of trade liberalization in Malaysia,"Malaysia is among the relatively more open economies in Asia. Many economic and environmental effects resulting from trade liberalization are cause of caution for more open economies like Malaysia. This study, by applying a computable general equilibrium, investigates the economic and environmental effects resulting from trade liberalization on Malaysia. It uses 2005 social accounting matrix as the main database in the model. By considering tariff reforms, this study concluded that 50 and 100 % trade liberalization, respectively, lead to 0.06 and 0.13 % increase in real gross domestic product and 0.6 and 1.29 % increase in trade flows. Therefore, greater liberalization leads to a greater increase in the overall real GDP and Malaysian trade flows. The 50 and 100 % tariff reforms also increase rural household consumption, respectively, by 0.45 and 0.92 % leading to an increase in their welfare by 0.49 and 1.01 %. There is such a situation for other household groups. Moreover, we found that both tariff reforms would lead to greater reduction in poverty gap and poverty severity (by 4.8 and 7.8 %, respectively) in urban households in comparison with other household groups. Results indicate that emissions of four more local air pollutants, (i.e., particular matter, CO, SO_2 and NO_ x ) are predicted to decrease, respectively, by 12, 11, 11 and 12 % as a result of trade liberalization, while emission of carbon dioxide, as a global air pollutant, increases by 0.14 %.

759,Linking climate change perceptions to adaptation and mitigation action,"One of the main contributors to anthropogenic climate change is agriculture, although, paradoxically, the sector is also very vulnerable to climate change effects, in particular extreme weather events. The agricultural sector can however make a significant contribution to climate change mitigation through increasing or sustaining soil carbon levels. The perception and action of farmers to anticipated climate change may be a significant determinant of both climate change impacts and mitigation efforts in agriculture. This is the first national-scale study of the perception of climate change by farmers and their associated farming practices regarding mitigation and adaptation. We find that Danish farmers realise that climate change will affect them in the future, and that many are already affected and are taking action to prevent future losses. Almost one fourth of the farmers surveyed stated that they include climate change mitigation in soil management planning. The majority of Danish farmers are already adapting to the effects of climate change, especially through maintaining or expanding drainage areas to reduce the impact of heavy rain, but also by changing soil management practices to increase water infiltration capacity. The study reveals the paradoxical finding that farmers, although believing that climate change is real, and having experienced losses due to adverse climatic events, do not tend to connect the two phenomena. Also there seems to be no link between perceptions of climate change and adaptation/mitigation action. Knowledge gained from this study can be useful for future policymaking on the effect of farm management practices in relation to climate change. Acknowledging farmers’ attitudes and beliefs may be an important component in understanding the responsiveness of the agricultural sector to initiatives to reduce emissions from farming and to improve the robustness of agricultural systems to climate change.",2016-09-01,10.1007/s10584-016-1718-x,"['Jørgensen, Sisse Liv', 'Termansen, Mette']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-016-1718-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

762,Contrastive analyses of the influence factors of interprovincial carbon emission induced by industry energy in China,"As a major contributor of carbon emission in the world, China should focus on the balance between the universality of development and regional heterogeneity of carbon discharge during the transformation toward low-carbon economy. To reveal the differences among interprovincial industry energy’s carbon emissions, some relevant data of carbon emissions in 29 provinces and municipalities during the period of 1996–2012 are selected in this study. Based on the Logarithmic Mean Divisia index decomposition model and hierarchical clustering method, the 29 provinces were clustered in turn by four time intervals according to some indicators, including economic intensity, energy intensity, industry structure, energy structure, demographic effect, and carbon density influence. Research results show that during 1996–2000, economic intensity has a strong positive driving effect on carbon emissions in such eastern provinces as Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, and other seven inland provinces, such as Hunan and Hubei. Demographic effects have strong pulling effects on carbon emissions in municipalities and eastern coastal provinces, and they also exert strong negative effects on carbon emissions in Anhui, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan in the first three time intervals. During the four periods, highly energy-efficient provinces are Jiangsu, Guangdong, Sichuan, Shandong, Hubei, etc., whose carbon emissions are significantly inhibited by their energy intensity, whereas inefficient provinces are concentrated in western regions, like Guangxi, Hainan, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, etc.",2016-04-01,10.1007/s11069-015-2096-9,"['Zhou, Xing', 'Zhou, Meihua', 'Zhang, Ming']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-015-2096-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Our analysis uses the wavelet method to model the correlation between CER and EUA in the time-frequency domain. It highlights the impact of different investors (according to their investment horizons) on the co-movement between the CER and EUA prices, and therefore, the behavior of individual investors as speculators, arbitrageurs, and hedgers on European allowance and CDM credits cumulatively. In this vein, we analyze according to the frequency intervals, price convergence, identification of potential factors that could explain a difference in futures prices, and structural changes in the EUA and CER prices.

764,A hybrid study of multiple contributors to per capita household CO_2 emissions (HCEs) in China,"Given the large expenditures by households on goods and services that contribute a large proportion of global CO_2 emissions, increasing attention has been paid to household CO_2 emissions (HCEs). However, compared with industrial CO_2 emissions, efforts devoted to mitigating HCEs are relatively small. A good understanding of the effects of some driving factors (i.e., urbanization rate, per capita GDP, per capita income/disposable income, Engel coefficient, new energy ratio, carbon intensity, and household size) is urgently needed prior to considering policies for reducing HCEs. Given this, in the study, the direct and indirect per capita HCEs were quantified in rural and urban areas of China over the period 2000–2012. Correlation analysis and gray correlation analysis were initially used to identify the prime drivers of per capita HCEs. Our results showed that per capita income/disposable income, per capita GDP, urbanization rate, and household size were the most significantly correlated with per capita HCEs in rural areas. Moreover, the conjoint effects of the potential driving factors on per capita HCEs were determined by performing principal component regression analysis for all cases. Based on the combined analysis strategies, alternative polices were also examined for controlling and mitigating HCEs growth in China.",2016-04-01,10.1007/s11356-015-5856-x,"['Qu, Jiansheng', 'Qin, Shanshan', 'Liu, Lina', 'Zeng, Jingjing', 'Bian, Yue']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-015-5856-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
765,A CGE analysis of carbon market impact on CO_2 emission reduction in China: a technology-led approach,"To offer a scientific basis and reference for policy makers when developing the regulation framework for Chinese national carbon market, this research analyzes the environmental and economic effects of the carbon market from a mid- to long-term perspective in China. Through a computable general equilibrium model, with technological progress as an endogenous variable, this study provides a comprehensive investigation on the relationships between the price of carbon, technological development, emission reduction and economic growth in low, mid- and high emission reduction scenarios. Furthermore, it analyzes the potential of price-setting mitigation measures to create incentives for technological progress. The results indicate that the carbon market will have a positive impact on the R&D investment in China and in turn would promote technology development. Consequently, it is vital that the carbon price is high enough; otherwise, the pressure on technological development will not be sufficiently strong; there is compatibility between carbon intensity reduction and mid- and long-term GDP growth, but it seems impossible to realize the positive effects on both emission reduction and economy development at the early stage. Hence, the carbon market alone will not be a cost-effective instrument for emission abatement and other auxiliary policies will also be needed in the early stages. Meanwhile, selection of reasonable emission reduction scenarios will play a crucial role in achieving the pre-2020 and post-2020 carbon reduction commitments efficiently in China.",2016-03-01,10.1007/s11069-015-2122-y,"['Yang, Lin', 'Yao, Yunfei', 'Zhang, Jiutian', 'Zhang, Xian', 'McAlinden, Karl J.']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-015-2122-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
766,Modeling carbon spot and futures price returns with GARCH and Markov switching GARCH models,"This paper makes use of spot and futures market data to carry out a thorough analysis of the dynamics of carbon price returns in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme for the whole first commitment period from 2008 to 2012. Understanding the properties of carbon price returns is especially crucial for industries which have to comply with an emission trading system and other market participants such as risk managers and speculators. We therefore seek to develop accurate models which capture the behavior of carbon price returns comprehensively. We apply a broad spectrum of GARCH model specifications, using different distributions for model innovations. As both time series, spot and futures price returns, exhibit asymmetric behavior in their variance, we additionally take Markov regime switching models for the variance equation into consideration. Empirical results demonstrate that AGARCH, NARCH and GJR fit the data best. We further show that, in the error term of any model, fat-tailed distributions—in particular the generalized error distribution—significantly improve the fit. Additionally, as futures returns seem to carry informational content concerning subsequent spot returns, we propose a sound, yet parsimonious, spot returns model, well-suited to capturing the dynamics. Finally, the most appropriate models for spot and futures price returns are tested in an out-of-sample environment, and further checked for robustness in data subsets. Subsequently a model for each market is proposed.",2016-03-01,10.1007/s10100-014-0340-0,"['Zeitlberger, Alexander C.

767,Implications of Economic Theory for Bioenergy Policy Design,"The chapter “Implications of Economic Theory for Bioenergy Policy Design” develops the analytical framework which is used in Chap. 5 to derive recommendations for German bioenergy policy. First, neoclassical theory implications for bioenergy policy, as well as their limits, are discussed. To move towards more realistic theory-based policy recommendations, the analysis draws on the theory of second-best, information economics, the theory of economic order, and new institutional economics, and gives an outlook on ecological economics implications. For each of these theories, relevant findings are applied to bioenergy policy, leading to the derivation of theoretical guidelines for bioenergy policy design. It is demonstrated that a combination of theoretical approaches is necessary to generate recommendations which adequately reflect the complexity of the bioenergy policy problem. However, among the theories considered, new institutional economics approaches are found to be particularly fruitful. Here, the matrix of institutions which jointly influence allocation decisions by bioenergy actors is at the centre of the policy analysis. Among new institutional economics approaches, transaction cost and contract economics, the principal-agent approach, the theory of institutional change, and the public choice approach provide valuable insights for generating policy design recommendations in the presence of uncertainty, transaction costs, path dependencies and political feasibility constraints. Because of the advantages that an institutional perspective offers for the analysis of bioenergy policy, new institutional economics is chosen as the overall framework into which insights from other theories are integrated.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-31135-7_3,"['Purkus, Alexandra']",Concepts and Instruments for a Rational Bioenergy Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-31135-7_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

769,Carbon Management in the Supply Network: Measurement and Reporting,"As we discuss in this book, business sustainability requires firms to develop and to adopt an integrated supply network which is committed to sustainability in order to mitigate risks and to create business value. In particular, environmental sustainability becomes a critical factor in management of the supply chain and the supply network because of the environmental impacts created along its network. While climate change now seems inevitable, there are increasingly high levels of uncertainty about the magnitude of its impacts. One thing is very clear: climate change will have a multiplier effect on supply chain risks. For example, in the autumn of 2011, an unusually intense monsoon season in Thailand caused floods which inundated more than 1,000 factories in the central region of the country. This flood severely disrupted the global supply of computer hard drives due to the concentration of assembly plants in the region. The global computer manufacturers who are the major buyers of hard drives (for example, Acer, Hewlett Packard, and Lenovo) were forced to cut their fourth-quarter sales between 5% and 10% due to delayed delivery, assembly, production and increased prices.",2016-01-01,10.1057/978-1-137-43576-7_5,"['Lee, Ki-Hoon', 'Vachon, Stephan']",Business Value and Sustainability,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/978-1-137-43576-7_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
770,"International Arrangements, the Kyoto Protocol and the Turkish Carbon Market","Using a combination of desk research and quantitative approach, this chapter assesses Turkey’s obligations deriving from the Kyoto Protocol, and other international arrangements with a specific focus on carbon trade. The desk research involves reviewing Turkey’s greenhouse gas emission and her responsibilities with regard to the aforementioned protocol and arrangements. Whereas the quantitative approach includes an estimation of Turkey’s emission reduction potential. The assessment shows that while not having any binding commitment to reduce greenhouse emissions deriving from the protocol, Turkey recognizes her responsibilities originating from the arrangements. Accordingly, Turkey implements various policies including voluntary emission trade initiated in 2005. Yet, the progress has been rather slow, among other reasons, due to inadequate legal infrastructure and high level of emission in the Turkish energy sector. This chapter cautions that unless the necessary legal adjustments, particularly in the Turkish tax law, are made, the carbon trade in Turkey is likely to be exposed to the carbon trade fraud once experienced within the EU Emission Trading System. Nevertheless, Turkey has accumulated significant experience through the voluntary emission trade so far. Based upon 2013 data, Turkey has a potential of reducing 20 million tons greenhouse gas emission with market value of $80 million yearly by revitalizing 308 small and large scale renewable energy projects.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-32268-1_4,"['Sever, Doğu', 'Bağdadioğlu, Necmiddin']",Energy and Finance,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-32268-1_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

772,The Carbon Economy: A Brave New World?,"Many regions throughout the world have adopted some form of carbon market mechanism, such as carbon trading (cap and trade) or taxes. As the outcome of the Copenhagen accord, the European Commission has set the new carbon emission target at 30% by 2020, up from 20%. In the United States the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recognizes the issues of ‘climate change-related risks’, and asks companies to disclose ‘material climate risks’. Even in large carbon emitting countries that have not signed or are opting out of the Kyoto accord, administrative areas are adopting market-based incentives to reduce carbon emissions from various industries. In December 2011, Canada opted out of the Kyoto protocol; however, in 2008, the Canadian province of British Columbia implemented a carbon tax, starting from $10 per tonne of carbon dioxide, then increasing gradually to the current price of $30 per tonne. It has been very effective in tackling the root cause of carbon pollution—the burning of fossil fuels. Since the tax came into effect, fuel use in British Columbia has dropped by 16 per cent while in the rest of Canada, it has risen by 3 per cent. A recent survey by Statistics Canada shows that within just six years of implementation, British Columbia’s policy has been an environmental and economic success. In 2012, the province of Quebec (Canada) announced that it had joined California’s existing carbon trading scheme by imposing a cap on energy intensive industries’ greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., mining, cement, utility and manufacturing industries).",2016-01-01,10.1057/978-1-137-43576-7_4,"['Lee, Ki-Hoon', 'Vachon, Stephan']",Business Value and Sustainability,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/978-1-137-43576-7_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Failing to address these challenges appropriately could easily result in stronger emission. According to statistics from the International Energy Agency in 2011, China’s carbon dioxide emissions exceeded those of the United States by 2.6 billion tons. Chinese emissions exceeded aggregate emissions of the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Brazil by 450 million tons, compared with other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-662-49071-6_1,"['Huang, Weiguang', 'Wang, Mingquan', 'Wang, Jun', 'Gao, Kun', 'Li, Song', 'Liu, Chen']","China Low-Carbon Healthy City, Technology Assessment and Practice",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-662-49071-6_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
778,Sustainable Consumption and Production in China,"The rising problem of severe resource scarcity, environmental pollution and ecological degradation has become a great constraint on economic development in China. Sustainable consumption and production (SCP), as a primary way to decouple economic development from environmental degradation, has been undertaken via various energy-saving and environmental protection policies in China. The main practices for SCP in China, including the adjustment of the industry structure, the promotion of a circular economy and cleaner production, the Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Project, green procurement, and progress in waste management are discussed. Though China has made some achievements in SCP, it is still facing serious challenges. The extensive economic growth model, strengthened by local governments with the incentive of the expectation of promotion and financial reward, aggravates the problems of resources and the environment. The imbalanced development in China, including uneven development among regions, imbalanced expenditure structure between consumption and investment, and the rising inequality in income resulting in imbalanced consumption with insufficient consumption accompanied by overconsumption, is challenging the coordination of development and protection. The weak capacity for scientific and technological innovation and the underdevelopment of non-governmental organizations in China leave the government as the main player in SCP, and this is inefficient for the development of SCP. It is suggested that SCP should be put forward as a development strategy and be conducted more systematically using existing policies in China so as to promote SCP more efficiently. China’s further reform is expected to lift the institutional barriers to SCP and promote economic transformation, balanced development and social equity. In addition, the long-term capacity for SCP calls for the improvement of independent technical innovation in enterprises and extensive social participation.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-43884-9_27,"['Chen, Hongmin']",Handbook on Sustainability Transition and Sustainable Peace,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-43884-9_27,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

783,Concluding Remarks,"This chapter brings together key information contained in “Evolving Climate and Environment in China: 2012,” a Chinese monograph. Significant warming in China for the last 100 years is unequivocal, confirmed by substantial observational data. Anthropogenic activities are very likely the key driver of the warming in China since the 1950s. Climate change has significantly impacted the eco- environment and socio-economy of China. The fast increase in greenhouse gas emissions from China is due to the rapid growth of China’s economy and its position in the world economy. Climate change projects show warming in China will continue throughout the twenty-first century. Technological and policy options for adaptation and mitigation are critical to China’s actions on climate change. Green industrialization and low-carbon urbanization are essential for sustainable development.

784,Exports and Participation in CDM in Technology Intensive Industries in India,"This study tries to find out the relationship between export and CDM participation for the technology intensive industries in India. Data are used from the PROWESS, CMIE and Verified Carbon Units (VCU) database from 2007 to 2012. Results of this study indicate that firm size, age of the firms, profitability and R&D intensity are the major determinants of export propensity. In addition, technology imports and multinational affiliation also help firms in exporting more. The CDM participation in terms of higher VCU, and energy related technological advancements at firm level are also found to be major determinants of export intensity.

786,"A North-South Model with Technological Spillovers, Environmental Degradation and Structural Change",This paper argues that boosting structural change in the world economy is a perspective way to mitigate climate changes. We analyse the dynamical R&D spillovers and cooperation between two sufficiently close economies under endogenous turnover of sectors (structural change). It turns out that the costless spillover of technology from one country to another accelerates structural change in both economies while increasing productivity in the lagging country only. If new technologies are progressively cleaner we show that such an increase in the speed of adoption of newer technologies leads to the slowdown of environmental degradation as measured by surface temperature. We conclude that technological spillovers and cooperation are beneficial both for the economy and environment provided participating parties are close enough in their technologies.,2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-39887-7_6,"['Bondarev, Anton', 'Greiner, Alfred']","Dynamic Modeling, Empirical Macroeconomics, and Finance",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-39887-7_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

791,"Normative Conflicts in Bangladesh: Nature/Forest Conservation, Corporate Interests and the Politics of Co-management","The proposed chapter will undertake a critique of the co-management approach to nature/forest conservation that supposedly ensures the participation of all relevant stakeholders (i.e. state actors, local communities, NGOs, and business enterprises) in nature/forest conservation projects for “sustainable development.” The co-management approach is theoretically guided by the principle of “learning-by-doing” and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the leading global organization that promotes this approach for conserving nature/forests. I argue that the co-management approach is very much apolitical and thus ignores the reality of the power relationship that always exists among the participating stakeholders. However, it is exposed when the implementation of such an approach to nature/forest conservation involves financially influential business actors like Chevron in the case I analyze. In such cases, business interests prevail over nature/forest conservation. And as a result, “sustainable development” becomes a mere pretext; the state and other non-state actors become legitimacy-providers to the whole process. I critique this co-management approach in light of a case study on the Chevron-IUCN business partnership in Bangladesh for conducting a seismic survey in the ecologically sensitive and legally protected Lawachara National Park where the existing forest laws of the country were violated. In terms of methodology, the proposed chapter is largely based on ethnographic research.

794,Impacts of total energy consumption control and energy quota allocation on China’s regional economy based on a 30-region computable general equilibrium analysis,"This paper examined the impacts of the total energy consumption control policy and energy quota allocation plans on China’s regional economy. This research analyzed the influences of different energy quota allocation plans with various weights of equity and efficiency, using a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for 30 province-level administrative regions. The results show that the efficiency-first allocation plan costs the least but widens regional income gap, whereas the outcomes of equity-first allocation plan and intensity target-based allocation plan are similar and are both opposite to the efficiency-first allocation plan’ outcome. The plan featuring a balance between efficiency and equity is more feasible, which can bring regional economic losses evenly and prevent massive interregional migration of energy-related industries. Furthermore, the effects of possible induced energy technology improvements in different energy quota allocation plans were studied. Induced energy technology improvements can add more feasibility to all allocation plans under the total energy consumption control policy. In the long term, if the policy of the total energy consumption control continues and more market-based tools are implemented to allocate energy quotas, the positive consequences of induced energy technology improvements will become much more obvious.",2015-12-01,10.1007/s11769-015-0739-0,"['Li, Na', 'Shi, Minjun', 'Shang, Zhiyuan', 'Yuan, Yongna']",Chinese Geographical Science,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11769-015-0739-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

With parametric functions we fully solve the competitive economic equilibrium and the lobbying Nash equilibrium. The rate of the green subsidy results from complementary or opposing political pressures of the three interest groups.

797,Constraints on natural global atmospheric CO_2 fluxes from 1860 to 2010 using a simplified explicit forward model,"Land-use changes until the beginning of the 20^th century made the terrestrial biosphere a net source of atmospheric carbon. Later, burning of fossil fuel surpassed land use changes as the major anthropogenic source of carbon. The terrestrial biosphere is at present suggested to be a carbon sink, but the distribution of excess anthropogenic carbon to the ocean and biosphere sinks is highly uncertain. Our modeling suggest that land-use changes can be tracked quite well by the carbon isotopes until mid-20^th century, whereas burning of fossil fuel dominates the present-day observed changes in the isotope signature. The modeling indicates that the global carbon isotope fractionation has not changed significantly during the last 150 years. Furthermore, increased uptake of carbon by the ocean and increasing temperatures does not yet appear to have resulted in increasing the global gross ocean-to-atmosphere carbon fluxes. This may however change in the future when the excess carbon will emerge in the ocean upwelling zones, possibly reducing the net-uptake of carbon compared to the present-day ocean.",2015-11-27,10.1038/srep17352,"['Hellevang, Helge', 'Aagaard, Per']",Scientific Reports,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep17352.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

The results indicate that, first of all, the unequally weighted indicator system outperforms the equally weighted one according to regional developing situation in China; and the most important indicator affecting the allowance allocation is carbon reduction responsibility, followed by future development right and emission reduction efficiency. Second, China’s carbon emission intensity should be cut, but its absolute carbon emission volume may inevitably increase in the future due to the continuous economic growth, and we confirm that the western provinces may take the highest shares to increase carbon emissions, followed by the central, northeast and eastern provinces. Finally, in order to achieve the national target of carbon emission intensity reduction, the northeast and eastern provinces require reducing carbon emission intensity significantly from 2013 to 2020, while the central and western provinces should be given more developing room.",2015-11-01,10.1007/s11069-015-1883-7,"['Zhang, Yue-Jun', 'Hao, Jun-Fang']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-015-1883-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

More specifically, we compare advertising messages for two sets of actors in the voluntary carbon market: criminal and non-criminal organizations. To carry out this analysis we draw upon a grounded theory approach to analyze marketing websites for a sample of organizations that sell credits. We discover that overall, organizations draw upon ecological modernization ideology to provide opportunities to gain access to investors and victims by emphasizing (1) sustainability; (2) ethical behaviour; (3) economic development; and, (4) technological innovation.

800,The design flaw of the displacement principle of clean development mechanism: the neglect of electricity shortage,"This study addresses a methodology flaw of Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) that neglects the wide-spread electricity shortage in the developing countries. The impact of this neglect is huge: about half of the annual carbon credits from the projects registered by 2010 are from the on-grid electricity displacement projects, and the majority of them had concentrated in several countries where electricity shortage remains severe and lasting. In the context of widespread energy shortage, the extra electricity produced by the CDM projects is more likely to be used to provide extra electricity supply rather than substitute the Business-as-usual (BAU) electricity supply. Hence, the neglect of the wide-spread energy shortage in the CDM methods puts the integrity of a critical amount of the CDM carbon credit in question.",2015-10-01,10.1007/s10657-012-9374-8,"['Zhu, Jinshan', 'Tang, Yingkai']",European Journal of Law and Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10657-012-9374-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
801,Consumption-Based Adjustment of Emissions-Intensity Targets: An Economic Analysis for China’s Provinces,"China’s Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011–2015) aims to achieve a national carbon intensity reduction of 17 % through differentiated targets at the provincial level. Allocating the national target among China’s provinces is complicated by the fact that more than half of China’s national carbon emissions are embodied in interprovincial trade, with the relatively developed eastern provinces relying on the center and west for energy-intensive imports. This study develops a consistent methodology to adjust regional emissions-intensity targets for trade-related emissions transfers and assesses its economic effects on China’s provinces using a regional computable-general-equilibrium (CGE) model of the Chinese economy. This study finds that in 2007 China’s eastern provinces outsource 14 % of their territorial emissions to the central and western provinces. Adjusting the provincial targets for those emissions transfers increases the reduction burden for the eastern provinces by 60 %, while alleviating the burden for the central and western provinces by 50 % each. The CGE analysis indicates that this adjustment could double China’s national welfare loss compared to the homogenous and politics-based distribution of reduction targets. A shared-responsibility approach that balances production-based and consumption-based emissions responsibilities is found to alleviate those unbalancing effects and lead to a more equal distribution of economic burden among China’s provinces.",2015-08-01,10.1007/s10640-014-9809-5,"['Springmann, Marco', 'Zhang, Da', 'Karplus, Valerie J.']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-014-9809-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

The transportation sector is one of the most critical sectors concerning environmental pollution and represents about 20 percent of the yearly total greenhouse gas emissions for the energy sector in Korea. In spite of the increasing importance of the transportation sector in the eco-environment, current methodologies to analyze greenhouse gas emissions use a Tier 1 method, which is the simplest type among the methodologies recommended by IPCC guidelines. For a new methodology, we consider characteristics of transportation modes and operational environments in Korea. The proposed methodology can analyze the amount of greenhouse gas emissions for each transport mode and integrate it through transportation environments. It also provides a decision-making tool for governments to make transportation polices. As a result, the Korean government can manage the transportation sector in an eco-friendly manner and improve the national eco-environment.",2015-07-01,10.1007/s10479-013-1452-y,"['Sim, Seungbae', 'Oh, Jisoo', 'Jeong, Bongju']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-013-1452-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
805,Towards a global scheme for carbon emissions reduction in aviation: China’s role in blocking the extension of the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme,"In 2008, the European Union (EU) decided to include aviation in its Emissions Trading System (ETS) in order to realize emissions reductions in the aviation sector. However, the unilateral measure has triggered strong opposition from various actors, and now, the EU finds itself in the middle of a substantial power struggle about the creation of a global scheme for international aviation emissions reduction. China plays an important role as it has not only banned its airlines from complying with the EU ETS, but also implemented economic retaliatory measures, such as freezing orders of new European Airbus aircraft. Consequently, Beijing could successfully form coalitions with other countries to dilute international negotiations at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) assembly in 2013. The study reveals the hardships that the establishment of a global carbon emissions reduction scheme for aviation faces. It discusses the leading role of the EU on the issue, and provides a general assessment of possible responses to the aviation directive. It then analyzes China’s position on the inclusion of aviation under a global carbon reduction scheme. Finally, the study provides a prospect on how to overcome the diplomatic struggle in order to achieve concrete carbon emission reductions in aviation. As the study concludes, the EU and the rest of the world would be better off by refraining from unilateral mitigation measures and emphasizing more involvement, engagement, and capacity building in negotiating a possible carbon reduction scheme at the international level.",2015-06-01,10.1007/s10308-014-0398-2,"['Ibitz, Armin']",Asia Europe Journal,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10308-014-0398-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
806,Game-theoretic analysis for an emission-dependent supply chain in a ‘cap-and-trade’ system,"The paper focuses on the impact of emission ‘cap-and-trade’ mechanism in a so-called emission-dependent supply chain with the emission permit supplier and the emission-dependent firm. In the cap-and-trade system, emission permit becomes one of key factors of production for emission-dependent firms. Two major sources of emission permits are considered—emission cap/quota imposed by the government, and permits purchased via emission trading. If the quota is insufficient to satisfy the target production, extra permits should be purchased via trading. In this case, the traditional non-profit green organizations may be endowed with the role of emission permit suppliers. Thus, the introduction of market mechanism injects new life into environment protection. In the context of newsvendor, the paper investigates the behavior and decision-making of each member in the emission-dependent supply chain. A game-theoretical analytical model is proposed and the unique Nash equilibrium is derived. In their own self-interest, the emission permit supplier and the emission-dependent firm make their optimal decisions on permits pricing and production quantity respectively. Players’ bargaining power in the game is affected by several exogenous factors, such as the governmental environment policy, the market risk, etc. Several valuable managerial insights on bargaining power affected by external factors (such as environmental policies, market risks, etc.) are further concluded.",2015-05-01,10.1007/s10479-011-0964-6,"['Du, S.', 'Ma, F.', 'Fu, Z.', 'Zhu, L.', 'Zhang, J.']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-011-0964-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

This article explains why China turns to market forces and is opt for emissions trading, rather than carbon or environmental taxes at least initially, discusses the five pilot trading schemes that have to comply with their emissions obligations by June 2014, and examines a wide range of design, implementation, enforcement and compliance issues related to China’s carbon trading pilots and their first-year performance.

The results show that the systematic risk of the EU ETS market is around 0.07 %, but the CDM market is clearly divided into two stages; the systematic risk of the futures contracts in the first stage (DEC09–DEC12) is less than the EU ETS market, but the systematic risk of the futures contracts that enter the market is greater than the EU ETS market and has a higher market sensitivity, although on the unsystematic risk. The CDM market is always greater than the EU ETS market. Abnormal returns in the two carbon markets are both lower than 0.02 %, but CDM is higher. The probability of price down is greater than that of price up. The carbon price is affected by market mechanisms and external factors (economic crisis and environmental policies) in the low expectations of returns.

This paper employs the Gini coefficient, a measurement of inequality in economics, to implement the equality principle, and build relative mathematical model for the allocation problem. Two indicators, output and investment, are chosen to calculate the Gini coefficient, because the output stated for its contribution to the society, while the investment implied its scale and attitude towards the environment.

813,Food Safety Regulation and Private Standards in China,"Both global and domestic markets place increasing importance on the quality and safety of food products produced in China. The presence of microbial agents, toxic animal or plant products, and chemical contamination are major food safety problems. Suppliers to export markets face relatively high refusal rates for Chinese food products. We provide an overview of food safety problems in China and the changes and efforts made by the government and private sector to meet the needs for improved food safety. Evidence from the vegetables and vegetable processing sector illustrate the challenges in developing a coordinated quality and food safety system and the advantages that larger scale firms and integrated supply chains hold in competing in high quality markets. Both the lack of testing and inability to control hazards as they enter the food distribution system lead to systemic failures in the food production system. Current efforts are directed to developing supply networks to assure safe production practices among suppliers, and investing in greater control of products and traceability in the supply system. Challenges center on problems of (1) coordination and enforcement of food safety regulations, (2) implementing traceability in the agricultural and food product system, (3) lack of public confidence in the safety of the food supply, and (4) the high cost of implementing food safety controls. Improving technical standards at each stage throughout the supply chain and integrating the entire process requires attention to demonstration, training and consultative services, as well as investment in infrastructure, testing, and systems of tracking ingredients and product. Establishing and comprehensively enforcing a unified legal and regulatory food safety system in China would provide the foundation to maintaining quality and food safety in both domestic and export markets.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-15227-1_9,"['Jensen, Helen H.', 'Zhou, Jiehong']","Food Safety, Market Organization, Trade and Development",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-15227-1_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
814,The Paradox of Measurable Counterfactuals and the Fall of Emissions Trading,"What we want to stress is the epistemological ambivalence and the contradictions of neo-liberalism — the ways that the fallibility of expert knowledge are alternately highlighted and downplayed — are marshalled as a vital defence mechanism against unwanted governmental intervention. (Davies and McGoey, 2012: 73) If we remain stuck in the short time frame of the now we are also likely to become bereft in the imagination of futures. (Back and Puwar, 2012: 8) Counterfactuals are speculations about the future; literally thought experiments in possibility. At base they are ‘if X then Y statements’. In this sense, they are essential inputs to and outputs from economic modelling: potential futures must be speculated upon to make them calculable. Modellers themselves are all too aware of the limits of their tools; however, these tools must be understood by policymakers who have their own agendas and rationales (MacKenzie, 1983). The paradox of measurable counterfactuals lies in the ambivalent epistemology of emissions reductions against some imagined ‘command-and-control’ future. At base, the paradox is: The emissions reductions are objective and therefore beyond politics.… We agreed on how to measure the Baseline against which emissions are to be reduced.",2015-01-01,10.1057/9781137490384_7,"['Kuch, Declan']",The Rise and Fall of Carbon Emissions Trading,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/9781137490384_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

816,The Technopolitics of National Carbon Accounts,"Technopolitics of classification is sorely lacking in much climate policy analysis. Policy details matter much more than the headline figures of emissions-reduction numbers imply. These numbers wrongly presume a common and agreed calculative ‘frame’, to use Michel Callon’s term for the often-unstated infrastructure of economic exchanges. This chapter explains how land-use calculation relies upon decisions and judgements. For this reason, the rationalist dream of a decisively framed global ‘nature’ against which a global carbon price can be calibrated is inherently political. Furthermore, rationalists’ reliance on a misguided concept of nature obscures expert judgements and the very practice of making the world accountable. In exploring the decisions required to make land-use change accountable, this chapter shows how the politics of the Kyoto Protocol are not reducible to pre-existing social interests on one side and natural representations (especially of trees) on the other, as assumed by many liberal commentators; but, rather, this politics involves social-group formation around issues.",2015-01-01,10.1057/9781137490384_5,"['Kuch, Declan']",The Rise and Fall of Carbon Emissions Trading,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/9781137490384_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

And it is also important scientific basis on which to cope with climate change Climate change , to manage ecosystem adaptively and to make relevant policies. If the change of the earth system’s strength power is the ultimate concern of global climate change study, it will be to focus on questions to recognize the change of ecosystem’s structure, process, and function motivated by climate change and human activities. The earth feeds on massive diverse natural ecosystem, and diverse semi-natural semi-artificial ecosystem, which is already a result of a long-term adaption of the earth to natural environment and human activities. In that case, the adaption research of the ecosystem to the environment change plays a key role in humans getting to know what influence global changes may have on the supporting capacity of earth system. This chapter mainly concerns about the ecosystem’s adaptability. It is defined as the adaptive abilities of lowering environment changes’ negative influence and making good use of favorable opportunities when environment changes but the ecosystem tries to maintain its main functions. And this balance mechanism and adaptability of ecosystem is a basis on which to judge the influence degrees of global changes on ecosystem’s structure and function.

819,Principles and Application of Sustainable Development,"At present, sustainable development has become the consensus of governments and the people around the world, and has come from concept to practice. However, it involves the reform of population, resources, environment, production, technology, institutions, and concept. In order to achieve this goal, the road is long and full of hardships in the future. Especially for China, which is a country confronted with an enormous population, a serious shortage of resources per capita, high pressure on employment, outstanding ecological and environmental problems, and the promotion of regional sustainable development has important practical significance. To promote sustainable development, first we need to choose an index that can fully reflect regional natural, economical and social characteristics from the perspective of system, then follow certain principles to establish evaluation indicator or indicator system to evaluate the sustainable development. Single index or multi-index evaluation method can be used for the evaluation of sustainable development. Eco-compensation Eco-compensation aims at the conservation Conservation and sustainable use of ecosystem services; it is an institutional arrangement that regulates the relationship between different stakeholders using economic method and an important means to realize sustainable development. In China, the theory and practice of eco-compensation has experienced the following stage in turn: groping spontaneously, theoretical research, and combining theory and practice. On the whole, the goal of realizing global sustainable development reflects the coordination between human and nature, and between different individuals. Coordination between human and nature provides guarantee for sustainable development, and guarantee of harmonious relations between different individuals reflect the rationality and orderly organization of sustainable development.

Understanding the uncertainty in GHG emissions over time is very important to better communicate uncertainty and to improve the setting of emission targets in the future. This is a diagnostic study divided into two parts. The first part analyses the historical change in the total uncertainty of CO2 emissions from stationary sources that the member states estimate annually in their national inventory reports. The second part presents examples of changes in total uncertainty due to structural changes in GHG emissions considering the GAINS (Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies) emissions scenarios that are consistent with the EU’s “20-20-20” targets. The estimates of total uncertainty for the year 2020 are made under assumptions that relative uncertainties of GHG emissions by sector do not change in time, and with possible future uncertainty reductions for non-CO2 emissions, which are characterized by high relative uncertainty. This diagnostic exercise shows that a driving factor of change in total uncertainty is increased knowledge of inventory processes in the past and prospective future.

821,Economic and Land-Use Optimization of Lignocellulosic-Based Bioethanol Supply Chains Under Stochastic Environment,"The ever increasing concerns such as energy security and climate change calls for a wide range of alternate renewable sources of energy. Bioethanol produced from lignocellulosic feedstock show enormous potential as an economically and environmentally sustainable renewable energy source. In recent years considerable research has focused on the economic feasibility of lignocellulosic-based biofuel supply chains while analytical understanding of land-usage for biomass cultivation has remained limited. Switchgrass is considered as one of the best lignocellulosic feedstock for bioethanol production that can be cultivated on both marginal land with arid soil and crop land. Switchgrass cultivated on crop land normally gives twice the yield when compared with marginal land: however, the higher yield is obtained due to higher input costs. Crop lands are a finite resource and their widespread use for growing energy crops rather than food crops like corn and wheat has resulted in land-use issues such as food versus fuel debate. Therefore, cultivation of switchgrass on marginal land is being studied intensively to minimize the use of crop land for biomass cultivation. This work proposes a novel dual-objective stochastic optimization model to maximize the expected profit and simultaneously minimize usage of crop land to cultivate switchgrass for a lignocellulosic-based bioethanol supply chain (LBSC) Lignocellulosic-based bioethanol supply chain (LBSC) under uncertainties of biomass supply, bioethanol demand and bioethanol sale price. The model determines the optimum allocation of marginal land and crop land for switchgrass cultivation, biorefinery locations, and biomass processing capacity of biorefineries. The e –constraint method is applied to trade-off Trade-off among the competing objectives of profit maximization and land-use minimization. In order to solve the proposed stochastic model efficiently and effectively, the Sample Average Approximation method is utilized. A case study based in the state of Alabama in the U.S. illustrates the application of the proposed stochastic model. In addition, sensitivity analyses are conducted to provide insights on the important factors that impact on the profitability and land usage in the LBSC.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-20092-7_9,"['Zhang, Jun', 'Osmani, Atif']",Handbook of Bioenergy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-20092-7_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

It adopts Tallberg’s ( 2003 ) three-tiered agenda-building model to analyse three phases in which the United Kingdom has been a key player in shaping the internal energy market agenda: the 1970s, with an agenda exclusion strategy pursued as long EU interests did not match British preferences on market liberalisation; the 1980s–1990s, with an explicit uploading of Britain-to-EU agenda-setting strategy promoting energy market liberalisation according to successful domestic experiences; the 2000s, with an agenda-structuring approach that attempted to assert Britain’s leadership in climate-change action. The chapter ultimately argues that the goals, regulatory instruments and market-driven vision uploaded from the United Kingdom to the EU is the grounds for the current paradigm for energy policy making in the EU.

825,From federal to city mitigation and adaptation: climate change policy in Mexico City,"Climate change is projected to affect Latin America and the Caribbean as a result of increased temperatures and changed rainfall patterns. The impacts of climate change are expected to be unevenly distributed throughout the region, due to differences in geographic location, demographic pressures, levels of poverty, and natural resource dependence. To date, few studies have explored these impacts and the governmental responses to cope with them at a city scale. This article examines the challenges faced by the Mexico City government as it translates the federal climate change policy into successful mitigation and adaptation. It analyzes climate change impacts on Mexico and Mexico City (also known as the Federal District), the federal and city’s mitigation and adaptation responses, and advances and contradictions in the implementation of these strategies at the national and city levels. Similar problems have limited the effectiveness of these actions at both the federal and city levels, including the overexploitation of natural resources, a lack of climate information and monitoring systems, and the subordination of climate change strategies to the objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. These problems have resulted in poor coordination and collaboration among various levels of government to cope with climate change, in addition to avoiding local capacity building, particularly in regard to forest conservation.",2014-10-01,10.1007/s11027-013-9455-1,"['Sosa-Rodriguez, Fabiola S.']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-013-9455-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Soil or water salinity represents one of the major causes of crop stress. Species of the genus Atriplex are characterized by high biomass productivity, high tolerance to drought and salinity, and high efficiency in use of solar radiation and water. Based on a search of the international literature, the authors outline an agro-climatic zoning model to determine potential production areas in Argentina for Atriplex halimus and Atriplex numularia . Using the agroclimatic limits presented in this work, this model may be applied to any part of the world. When superimposed on the saline areas map, the agroclimatic map shows the suitability of agro-ecological zoning for both species for energy purposes on land unsuitable for food production.

They evidence many scientists' desire to help humanity confront the momentous biophysical implications of its own actions. But they also reveal a limited conception of social science and virtually ignore the humanities. They thereby endorse a stunted conception of 'human dimensions' at a time when the challenges posed by global environmental change are increasing in magnitude, scale and scope. Here, we make the case for a richer conception predicated on broader intellectual engagement and identify some preconditions for its practical fulfilment. Interdisciplinary dialogue, we suggest, should engender plural representations of Earth's present and future that are reflective of divergent human values and aspirations. In turn, this might insure publics and decision-makers against overly narrow conceptions of what is possible and desirable as they consider the profound questions raised by global environmental change.

828,Robust design of a closed-loop supply chain network for uncertain carbon regulations and random product flows,"This paper addresses a multi-period capacitated closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network design problem subject to uncertainties in the demands and returns as well as the potential carbon emission regulations. Two promising regulatory policy settings are considered: namely, (a) a carbon cap and trade system, or (b) a tax on the amount of carbon emissions. A traditional CLSC network design model using stochastic programming is extended to integrate robust optimization to account for regulations of the carbon emissions caused by transportation. We propose a hybrid model to account for both regulatory policies and derive tractable robust counterparts under box and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets. Implications for network configuration, product allocation and transportation configuration are obtained via a detailed case study. We also present computational results that illustrate how the problem formulation under an ellipsoidal uncertainty set allows the decision maker to balance the trade-off between robustness and performance.

830,Infrastructure topology optimization under competition through cross-entropy,"In this article, we study a two-level non-cooperative game between providers acting on the same geographic area. Each provider has the opportunity to set up a network of stations so as to capture as many consumers as possible. Its deployment being costly, the provider has to optimize both the number of settled stations as well as their locations. In the first level each provider optimizes independently his infrastructure topology while in the second level they price dynamically the access to their network of stations. The consumers’ choices depend on the perception (in terms of price, congestion and distances to the nearest stations) that they have of the service proposed by each provider. Each providers' market share is then obtained as the solution of a fixed point equation since the congestion level is supposed to depend on the market share of the provider, which increases with the number of consumers choosing the same provider. We prove that the two-stage game admits a unique equilibrium in price at any time instant. An algorithm based on the cross-entropy method is proposed to optimize the providers' infrastructure topology and it is tested on numerical examples providing economic interpretations.",2014-06-01,10.1057/jors.2012.96,"['Le Cadre, H']",Journal of the Operational Research Society,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/jors.2012.96,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

The Green Deal represents a fundamental reorganisation of policy because it places a considerable reliance on the role of markets to deliver the required energy savings. After some initial Government funding, support programmes have been curtailed or removed completely and role of government restricted to capacity building, accreditation and compliance monitoring. Will the Green Deal succeed? This paper reviews the history of energy efficiency policy and programmes in the UK from 1973 to the present day, taking account of the political environment and of the wider context of energy and climate policy development. This information is then analysed to draw out what is generally considered to be effective policy, and applies this to the current policy landscape.",2014-02-01,10.1007/s12053-013-9197-7,"['Mallaburn, Peter S.', 'Eyre, Nick']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12053-013-9197-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
833,Emissions Trading,"Climate change is being exacerbated by the emissions of globe-warming greenhouse gases (GHGs) as a consequence of economic activities associated with energy, industry, transportation, and land use. From an economic viewpoint, the Earth’s climate is a public good , and pollution a negative externality ; such change therefore constitutes market failure . Controlling air pollution by utilizing economic mechanisms represents an important change in environmental thinking – literally a paradigm shift away from historical command-and-control engineering systems. Today, this approach is being utilized to mitigate the emissions of GHGs, addressing the pollution externality by putting a price on carbon. The international carbon market, largely developed as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, had a total value of $176 billion in 2011, but it has decreased significantly in recent years. With the addition of China and other national and subnational programs, however, it is expected that it will once again increase, as a larger and larger portion of emitted GHGs come under such regulatory purview. Historically, the largest component of that market has been the European Union’s Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which represents a regional market designed first to assist Europe in achieving compliance with the Protocol’s requirements, and now is a cornerstone of the EU’s policy to combat climate change. It also has links to the Protocol’s project-based mechanisms, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI), which help minimize compliance costs. China’s nascent market – currently seven pilot schemes, but expected to become a national program in 2016 – should ultimately become twice as large as the EU ETS. Other carbon markets created in numerous countries (e.g., the U.S., Japan, South Korea, etc.) as well as a voluntary market are also expected to make significant contributions. This chapter discusses the structure of these emissions trading carbon markets, the theory behind their development, their historical evolution, ongoing governance challenges, and future prospects.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_8-2,"['Raufer, Roger', 'Coussy, Paula', 'Freeman, Carla', 'Iyer, Sudha']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_8-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
834,Carbon Markets: Linking the International Emission Trading Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS),"The trading of carbon emission permits is an instrument created recently to tackle the climate change problem. From 2005 onward, in particular, the volume and significance of different carbon emission trading schemes have increased spectacularly; despite the fact that new emission trading schemes are appearing, the value of the market had fallen by the end of the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period in 2012. One fundamental reason for this was the uncertainty as to whether a new global agreement or protocol would be reached in 2015. The main goal of this chapter is to offer an overview of International Emission Trading under the Kyoto Protocol together with the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), as the schemes at the core of today’s carbon markets, exploring their basic structure, their main links, and their differences, including a carbon price analysis underlining their fundamental weaknesses and strengths.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_57-1,"['Martínez de Alegría, Itziar', 'Molina, Gonzalo', 'del Río, Belén']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-6431-0_57-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
835,Agroforestry and the Carbon Market in the Tropics,"To slow the increase of the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases responsible for climate change, initiatives such as the United Nations REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) Programme have been taken. The UN-REDD programme supports REDD+ (i.e., conservation and sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of C stocks, on top of REDD) readiness efforts in the design and implementation of national programs and in national REDD+ action through common approaches and interventions. The REDD+ policies propose to financially compensate countries that improve forest conservation and management to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG; i.e., carbon dioxide (CO_2), methane (CH_4) and nitrous oxide (N_2O)) emissions and mitigate against climate change. The REDD+ initiative has recently evolved to REDD++ (i.e., low carbon (C) emission or low C footprint land use systems through eco-agricultural practices on top of REDD+). Eco-agricultural practices, which aim at producing more food while conserving wild biodiversity, include agroforestry systems such as perennial tree-crop systems, windbreaks, and live fences. Agroforestry systems also store C and may qualify as an afforestation practice as is defined in the Kyoto Protocol, and could be included in the C market under the REDD+ scheme. The Kyoto protocol that deals with environmental issues, especially climate change, is heavily based on clean development mechanism (CDM) as a strategy to mitigate atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The inclusion of agroforestry in CDM is hampered by the lack of standardized methods to estimate C stocks, as well as land tenure issues in the tropics, especially in Africa. Another challenge for the inclusion of agroforestry to CDM is the payment for environmental (or ecosystem) services (PES) option that should be implemented in C contracts. This chapter discusses the opportunities for including agroforestry in C markets, as well as the difficulties and PES options linked to it.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-7723-1_20,"['Atangana, Alain', 'Khasa, Damase', 'Chang, Scott', 'Degrande, Ann']",Tropical Agroforestry,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-7723-1_20,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

837,Valuing Options in Water Markets: A Laboratory Investigation,"Risk and reliability dominate water supply discussions in the arid western United States due to increasing demand and finite, weather-dependent supply. Water markets have evolved in this region so agencies could meet this growing demand. In a few instances, water agencies turned to contractual mechanisms such as options to manage supply. As demand continues to grow option markets and other novel approaches to allocating water may become increasingly popular. We utilize experimental economics to analyze the effect of annual options on water markets in the absence of sufficient real-world data for conventional econometric analysis. We find gains from trade are higher when options can be traded. Additionally, gains are more evenly distributed, particularly with a dominant buyer and many sellers. Findings suggest option markets may be a viable choice as policymakers prepare for future droughts.",2014-01-01,10.1007/s10640-013-9659-6,"['Hansen, Kristiana', 'Kaplan, Jonathan', 'Kroll, Stephan']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-013-9659-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
838,Reducing Resource Consumption – A Proposal for Global Resource and Environmental Policy,"Environmental and resource economics do not give the emphasis to ecosystem functions and the natural world that their importance to human welfare and the economy warrant. Insights from ecological economics, in contrast, suggest that the overall material throughput of the economy, in addition to the wastes it emits to air, sea and land, need to be greatly reduced. While environmental economics suggests that market-based instruments would be an efficient means of achieving both resource and environmental objectives, there are in fact many reasons, revealed by Public Choice analysis, why these are not implemented. Notwithstanding, it seems likely that, to address the pressing resource and environmental challenges facing humanity, policies will need to be implemented at both the international and national levels. This paper suggests that existing climate policy, based on international targets and national policies to meet them, could be supplemented by a similar policy on resource use, involving: either a global level of taxation to meet resource use targets, with transfers to poorer countries to aid their resource-efficient development; or a global resource permit trading scheme, with diminishing resource allowances over time. The latter could begin with a small group of larger, industrialised countries, which encouraged others to join the group by imposing taxes on imports from non-members equivalent to their own self-imposed resource surcharges. Coupled to a regime of Sustainable Commodity Agreements, to promote environmentally sound resource extraction, such a system could lead over time to the globally sustainable development which has as yet quite eluded the global community.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5706-6_14,"['Ekins, Paul', 'Meyer, Bernd', 'Schmidt-Bleek, Friedrich', 'Schneider, Friedrich']",Factor X,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5706-6_14,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
839,Driving Down Emissions: The Role of Carbon Pricing,"Much of the discussion of climate change rests on the assumption that excess carbon dioxide emissions are a consequence of a market failure. Since the long-run costs of climate change are not built into the price of fossil fuels, the assumed solution is to internalize the costs of carbon. Indeed within the international policy community, carbon pricing is the favoured policy of neoclassical economists (e.g. Garnaut, Stern) and dominates policy discussions (Geels 2012 ).",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-02940-5_6,"['Palmer, Graham']",Energy in Australia,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-02940-5_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
840,Socio-Economic Aspects of Rural Bioenergy Production,"This chapter covers the socio-economic costs and benefits of bioenergy production in developing countries. The chapter will consider the role local communities can play in the provision of biomass for energy and benefits they can gain in the process. It will analyse the externalities related to bioenergy production that could impact on the socio-economic well-being of local communities. It will consider aspects such as the conversion of land to bioenergy plantations and a change from agricultural food production to biomass production. Examples from across the globe will be used to highlight this socio-economic impact. Bioenergy already serves as a critical energy source to rural households who rely on fuelwood for heating and cooking. The question is should local communities continue providing for their own bioenergy or should they be encouraged to become part of commercial bioenergy projects that could sell electricity, thereby providing a source of income for communities to pay for electricity. Unless bioenergy can be produced in a way that will enhance the socio-economic well-being of the people involved its sustainability as a renewable energy source is questionable.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-7448-3_9,"['Ham, Cori', 'Kleynhans, Theo E.']",Bioenergy from Wood,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-7448-3_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

843,Emission trading or proportional carbon tax: a quest for more efficacious emission control,"Background Two alternative procedures currently exist for efficient carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions control: carbon emission trading and proportional carbon tax. This article explores which of the two is more desirable and efficacious. Results Compared to emission trading, the equilibrium under a universal proportional carbon tax achieves Pareto superior allocation. In addition, the price of a unit of CO_2 emissions is much higher in the case of a universal proportional carbon tax than for bilateral emissions trading. Conclusions This paper reveals the superiority of a universal proportional carbon tax over the emissions trading in terms of the efficiency of CO_2 emissions control. However, deciding and abiding by a universal tax rate is likely to require great political will. In this sense, viewed in the current context, such a tax scheme is visionary. Gradualism is unavoidable. It is far more desirable to expand the network of the upcoming trilateral carbon trading network steadily rather than leaving the global economy to the laissez-faire situation.",2013-10-18,10.1186/2193-2697-2-8,"['Otaki, Masayuki']",Environmental Systems Research,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/2193-2697-2-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
844,Carbon emission right as a new property right: rescue CDM developers in China from 2012,"Clean development mechanism (CDM) is encountering many uncertainties due to the coming end of the commitment period and critically suggested reformation. As the largest participant in the CDM market, China shoulders the biggest proportion of market risk. Among the studies on CDM in China, few have focused upon the legal aspect of CDM, which is crucial in defending developers’ interests. To fill this research gap in making the transition from policy to law, this paper claims that carbon emission right, which is the basis of trade, should be attributed as a property right in Property Law of People’s Republic of China. The present study will discuss the characteristics of carbon emission, definition, and legal attribution of carbon emission right. The valid object of carbon emission right in the CDM market under Property Law should be certified emissions reductions (CERs). The usufructuary right could be specifically applied in practice to the owners’ property right on CERs in China. Although experience from the CDM is not fully applicable to the development of cap and trading, the success of CDM market provides a reasonable platform to study emission right in the view of legal science. Furthermore, the proposed research acts as the pioneer study that lay the theoretical foundations in legal science on emission right trading for other potential schemes, which in turn addresses international environmental issues.",2013-09-01,10.1007/s10784-012-9191-0,"['Pei, Qing', 'Liu, Lanlan', 'Zhang, David D.']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-012-9191-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
845,Austrian economics and climate change,"The aim of this paper is to outline and defend an Austrian policy response to climate change. A privatised climate change policy, based on Austrian welfare economics, is the only way to defend to the greatest possible degree the liberties both of fossil fuel users and people whose property rights will be violated if carbon emissions cause climate change. Neoclassical and ‘Post-Austrian’ analyses of climate change are both theoretically unsound and impractical, in requiring for their implementation a foundation in reliable scientific knowledge that is not available. Anthropogenic climate change is a putative interpersonal conflict rather than market failure. The use of fossil fuels should be subject to side-constraints designed to avoid the infringement of other people’s property rights. Tort litigation would protect these rights, where necessary. Litigation would also promote the public understanding and even the advancement of climate science.",2013-06-01,10.1007/s11138-012-0174-8,"['Dawson, Graham']",The Review of Austrian Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11138-012-0174-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

To do this, it traces and analyzes the roles of the Chinese government and other key actors. Through process tracing and literature review, it argues that the pre-legislation and territorially fragmented development pattern of the Chinese DVCM has resulted from the activities of Chinese local governments and non-state actors under the policy experimentation approach adopted by the Chinese central government.

847,Redressing China’s Strategy of Water Resource Exploitation,"China, with the confrontation of water-related problems as an element of its long history, has been investing heavily in water engineering projects over the past few decades based on the assumption that these projects can solve its water problems. However, the anticipated benefits did not really occur, or at least not as large as expected. Instead, the results involved additional frustrations, such as biodiversity losses and human-induced disasters (i.e., landslides and earthquakes). Given its inherent shortcomings, the present engineering-dominated strategy for the management of water resources cannot help solve China’s water problems and achieve its goal of low-carbon transformation. Therefore, the present strategy for water resources exploitation needs to be reevaluated and redressed. A policy change to achieve better management of Chinese rivers is urgently needed.",2013-03-01,10.1007/s00267-012-0002-8,"['Ran, Lishan', 'Lu, Xi Xi']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-012-0002-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

849,Carbon Emissions Management and the Financial Implications of Sustainability,"The concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have risen dramatically leading to the possibility of costly disruption from rapid climate change. This calls for greater attention and precautionary measures to be put in place, both globally and locally. Governments, business entities and consumers would be impacted by the extent to which such precautionary measures are incorporated in their decision making process. Business entities need to consider issues such as trading in carbon allowances (or permits), investment in low- CO_2 emission technologies, counting the costs of carbon regularity compliance and passing on the increased cost of carbon regulation to consumers through higher prices. Such considerations require information for informed decision making. This paper reports on a qualitative research study undertaken to consider the impact of the Kyoto protocol mechanisms on the changing information paradigms of cost and managerial accounting. It is demonstrated that the information from strategic cost management systems will be particularly useful in this new carbon-economy, especially in evaluating the ‘whole-of-life’ costs of products and services in terms of carbon emissions. Similarly, the study discusses how strategic management accounting information would facilitate decisions on business policy, human resource management, marketing, supply chain management and finance strategies and the resultant evaluation of performance. Under various carbon emissions trading schemes proposed around the world (including the United States), organizations will need to implement carbon management schemes to meet carbon ration targets, earn revenue and reduce costs. Emission Trading Schemes will impact the accounting profession significantly; however, discussions on how to report these transactions are in the very formative stages. So far the accounting literature has focused on the reporting of current carbon assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the timing effects of carbon releases in the income statement. However, there has been little or no discussion as to how to value and report the underlying non-current assets (and liabilities) that produce or use carbon allowances on the balance sheet.

850,Emissions Trading and Stock Returns: Evidence from the European Steel and Combustion Industries,"This chapter examines the impact of price changes of European Union Emission Allowances (EUAs) on stock returns of a sample of firms operating in the European steel and combustion industries. After the introduction of an EU-wide CO_2 emissions trading system in 2005, the first phase of the emission plans was completed in 2007 and the process of the second phase is still evolving. The empirical analysis of this paper covers both the first and second phases to deal with capturing time variances for the importance of the trading scheme. It is found that EUA price changes are positively correlated with stock returns of firms operating only in combustion industries over the first phase (2005–2007). However, there is evidence of a significant impact of EUA price changes on stock returns of firms from both combustion and steel industries during the sample period in the second phase (2008–2010). Firm size, age and leverage are also examined to explain the size of emission trading exposures across firms. The finding is that neither of these variables appears to be a significant determinant. This evidence indicates that EUA exposure is independent of firms’ characteristics.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-30601-3_7,"['Bruggeman, Jeroen', 'Gonenc, Halit']",Energy Economics and Financial Markets,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-30601-3_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
851,Cost and Opportunities from Mitigation and Adaptation in Agriculture,"It has been predicted that even though efforts are made to reduce drastically the GHG emissions, climate change would still occur as it takes long time for climatic processes to respond. Thus, in addition to mitigation, adaptation to climate change equally plays an important role. Agriculture is one of such sectors that remain highly vulnerable to climate change. It is presumed that the least developed countries are the most susceptible ones due to their higher dependency on climate sensitive sector such as agriculture, and is expected to aggravate further the regional disparities. The international climate change regime designed Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) to help facilitate industrialized countries to meet their emission targets. Developing countries could be a part of it from where they can fulfill their dual purpose of fulfilling own responsibility of achieving sustainable development and at the same time earn income through carbon finance. Organic farming, bio-gas, System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and community forestry are some of the potential areas discussed where developing countries could take such opportunity.

853,Optimal strategic regulations in international emissions trading under imperfect competition,"This paper analyzes governments’ strategic regulations in an imperfectly competitive market of international emissions trading (IET). Whether and how governments intervene in IET is explored. If regulations are decided, it is optimal for price-influencing countries to subsidize but for price-taking countries to tax permit trading. Conducting simulations of the Annex-1 emissions trading, we discover that no-intervention of all countries cannot be supported by any equilibrium. In contrast, all or some countries would regulate at equilibrium. In the latter case, price-influencing countries would not regulate but price-taking countries would. This justifies the necessity of considering no-intervention as a policy choice, and shows that a country’s decisions about strategically regulating IET may be affected by other countries’ intervention resolutions.",2013-01-01,10.1007/s10018-012-0033-7,"['Lee, Tsung-Chen', 'Chen, Hsiao-Chi', 'Liu, Shi-Miin']",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10018-012-0033-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Food and energy price rises sparked by rising temperatures and enduring drought in the Middle East and North Africa, combined with increased pumping of ground water, are implicated in the rise of civil conflict, revolution, and war in these regions since 2009. The inability of industrial civilisation to adapt to the climatological limits of the biosphere arises from the refusal of liberal economists and others to recognize that justice is contextual to the boundaried nature of political communities, and to the limits of the earth system. In the history of Western culture, discourses about justice first appear in association with the development of agriculture and irrigation systems in Mesopotamian cultures. Agriculture in the Levant made possible more densely populated societies, and the division of labour. It also permitted the emergence of great inequality and slavery. Hebrew discourses of government and justice evolved which sustained limits on the asymmetric distribution of land and its product in a bordered political community. These discourses also suggest that just land distribution not only makes for solidarity in self-sufficient communities, but for benign climates. Modern liberal theories of justice as procedural, and grounded in political rights and freedoms, miss the antique contextualisation of standards of justice in political and economic communities, and the role of restraints on power and wealth, and territorial limits, in the construction of justice.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-7470-4_20,"['Northcott, Michael S.']",Linking Ecology and Ethics for a Changing World,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-7470-4_20,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
858,Canada and the Kyoto Protocol: An Aesop Fable,"This chapter attempts to explain why Canada, a country whose citizens like to think of themselves as progressive in matters of both international cooperation and environmental protection, has waivered in the performance of its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and ultimately withdrawn entirely from it. We suggest that Canada’s inconsistency reflects not so much a change of heart of Canadians as a change of political leadership at the federal level. For much of the period, Canada was governed by a left-of-centre government which enthusiastically supported the Protocol. However, it did so in a way that alienated most of the provinces, particularly in the west, and tied the hands of future federal governments. And in 2006 – just a year after Kyoto came into force – the pro-Kyoto government was replaced in Ottawa by a right-of-centre anti-Kyoto one, which set about dismantling previous climate change initiatives and replacing them with their own, less stringent ones. Paradoxically, Canada’s emissions rose steadily in the first period and fluctuated downward in the latter. We suggest this is due more to the actions taken at the provincial level than to actions or inactions at the federal level.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5440-9_19,"['Glenn, Jane Matthews', 'Otero, José']",Climate Change and the Law,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5440-9_19,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

860,Skills Development Pathways in Asia,"Asian countries are among the most dynamic economies in the world. As a result of their rapid growth, several countries are experiencing skill shortages in higher-technology manufacturing. As a response, they have ambitious plans for increasing vocational education and training as part of their national development plans. However, it remains to be seen how these plans will be implemented at the local level. This chapter is divided into three sections: (1) skills challenges faced by Asian countries, (2) strategic approaches to skills development in Asian countries and (3) emerging policy themes.

861,How Economists Measure Wellbeing: Social Cost-Benefit Analysis,"This chapter constitutes a survey of economic measurement and social cost-benefit analysis. Economic analysis employs many of the same criteria as financial analysis to determine whether a project or activity is worth undertaking – net present value (NPV), the benefit-benefit ratio (B/C) and internal rate of return (IRR). The main difference relates to what is counted. Economists measure net benefits as surpluses, namely, consumer surplus, producer surplus (or quasi-rent), and differential and scarcity rents. These measures are described in detail, as are techniques (e.g., hedonic pricing, contingent valuation) for measuring non-market or environmental costs and benefits that accrue to citizens and need to be included in a social evaluation of a policy or project. As discussed in this chapter, environmental costs and benefits can be significant and their measurement controversial, and sometimes incorrectly applied. Since costs are incurred and benefits accrue at different times, an aggregation of costs and benefits requires that they be discounted to the present period (or compounded to a common future time) using a discount rate. The controversy as to which discount rate (or rates) is most appropriate to use is examined. Finally, the precautionary principle for addressing extreme events and the possibility of irreversibility is discussed; indeed, a precautionary approach is evident in some cost-benefit analyses of anthropogenic global warming through assumptions of an extremely low discount rate, a high probability of catastrophic future damages, and very low costs of immediate mitigation (as discussed further in Chap. 7 ).",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-4988-7_6,"['Kooten, G.

863,Will Australian Carbon Tax Affect the Resources Boom? Results from a CGE Model,"The resources sectors have been the engine of Australian economic growth in recent years, but there is a tremendous fear currently that the carbon tax policy introduced in July 2012 will kill this resources boom. By employing a computable general equilibrium model and an environmentally extended social accounting matrix, this article simulates the effects of Australian carbon tax on the resources sectors. The modelling results show that all resources sectors will be affected negatively but to different degrees. The brown coal sector will be hit dramatically with 25.36% decrease in output, 52.79% decrease in employment and 89.12% decrease in profitability. However, the other resources sectors are only mildly affected. Under the carbon tax, the resources sectors contribute significantly to the total emission reductions in Australia, especially in terms of activity emissions. Given the fact that brown coal accounts only for a small portion of the output of natural resources and is not export-oriented, it is reasonable to suggest that a carbon tax will not significantly affect the overall performance of the resources sectors.",2012-12-01,10.1007/s11053-012-9187-z,"['Meng, Xianming']",Natural Resources Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11053-012-9187-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

By highlighting the key trade-off between value creation and value capture and explaining when situations of simultaneous market and government failure may arise, I suggest that social entrepreneurship is the pursuit of sustainable solutions to neglected problems with positive externalities. I further discuss the situations in which problems with externalities are likely to be neglected and derive the central goal and logic of action of social entrepreneurs, in contrast to commercial entrepreneurs. Overall, this article provides a conceptual framework that allows understanding the growing phenomena of social entrepreneurship and its role in the functioning of modern society.",2012-12-01,10.1007/s10551-012-1413-4,"['Santos, Filipe M.']",Journal of Business Ethics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10551-012-1413-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

We discuss the effectiveness of emission reduction policies in light of these results and advance some proposals to reconcile environmental and trade policymaking. A partir de données de panel, nous constatons que le commerce a des effets directs et indirects significatifs sur les émissions de carbone. Le commerce tend à accroître la charge des émissions, particulièrement dans les pays moins industrialisés.

867,The radiative forcing benefits of “cool roof” construction in California: quantifying the climate impacts of building albedo modification,"Exploiting surface albedo change has been proposed as a form of geoengineering to reduce the heating effect of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs). Recent modeling experiments have projected significant negative radiative forcing from large-scale implementation of albedo reduction technologies (“cool” roofs and pavements). This paper complements such model studies with measurement-based calculations of the direct radiation balance impacts of replacement of conventional roofing with “cool” roof materials in California. This analysis uses, as a case study, the required changes to commercial buildings embodied in California’s building energy efficiency regulations, representing a total of 4300 ha of roof area distributed over 16 climate zones. The estimated statewide mean radiative forcing per 0.01 increase in albedo (here labeled RF01) is −1.38 W/m^2. The resulting unit-roof-area mean annual radiative forcing impact of this regulation is −44.2 W/m^2. This forcing is computed to counteract the positive radiative forcing of ambient atmospheric CO_2 at a rate of about 41 kg for each square meter of roof. Aggregated over the 4300 ha of cool roof estimated built in the first decade after adoption of the State regulation, this is comparable to removing about 1.76 million metric tons (MMT) of CO_2 from the atmosphere. The point radiation data used in this study also provide perspective on the spatial variability of cool roof radiative forcing in California, with individual climate zone effectiveness ranging from −37 to −59 W/m^2 of roof. These “bottom-up” calculations validate the estimates reported for published “top down” modeling, highlight the large spatial diversity of the effects of albedo change within even a limited geographical area, and offer a potential methodology for regulatory agencies to account for the climate effects of “cool” roofing in addition to its well-known energy efficiency benefits.",2012-06-01,10.1007/s10584-011-0250-2,"['VanCuren, Richard']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-011-0250-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

869,Short-Run Allocation of Emissions Allowances and Long-Term Goals for Climate Policy,"We use economic analysis to evaluate grandfathering, auctioning, and benchmarking approaches for allocation of emissions allowances and then discuss practical experience from European and American schemes. In principle, auctions are superior from the viewpoints of efficiency, fairness, transparency, and simplicity. In practice, auctions have been opposed by important sectors of industry, which argue that carbon pricing without compensation would harm international competitiveness. In the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, this concern led to grandfathering that is updated at various intervals. Unfortunately, updating gives industry an incentive to change behavior to influence future allocation. Furthermore, the wealth transferred to incumbent firms can be significantly larger than the extra costs incurred, leading to windfall profits. Meanwhile, potential auction revenues are not available to reduce other taxes. By circumscribing free allocation, benchmarking can target competitiveness concerns, incur less wealth transfer, and provide a strategy consistent with transitioning to auctions in the long run.",2012-02-01,10.1007/s13280-011-0238-1,"['Zetterberg, Lars', 'Wråke, Markus', 'Sterner, Thomas', 'Fischer, Carolyn', 'Burtraw, Dallas']",AMBIO,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13280-011-0238-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
870,Risk management and regulation compliance with tradable permits under dynamic uncertainty,"In this paper, we explore the effects of dynamic uncertainty on the risk management of regulated industries and emission market. We consider as major sources of uncertainty the stochastic growth of demand for the industry output (e.g. electric energy) and the ensuing lack of information on the pollution levels of individual firms, their behavior and the behavior of the regulator. These sources of uncertainty are common in pollution permit trading as not only does the market respond to the volatility of fundamentals but also to the vagaries of the institutional structure, created by public policy and enforced through regulation. The paper shows that in the presence of strategic behavior on the part of the agents involved, even though both the level and the volatility of output increases over time, trading of permits is a highly effective instrument of risk management, since it allows the firms to pool the risks arising from the volatile environment, thereby simplifying enforcement, reducing emissions and improving resource allocation. Moreover, uncertainty plays a subtle influencing role, since on one hand it broadens the regulator’s deterrent power over potential polluters, while on the other it reduces the expected value of the sanction for the individual firm.",2012-02-01,10.1007/s10657-010-9140-8,"['Scandizzo, Pasquale L.', 'Knudsen, Odin K.']",European Journal of Law and Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10657-010-9140-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
871,Contributions of Economics and Ethics to an Assessment of Emissions Trading,"Emissions trading (ET) is an economic policy instrument designed to manage environmental pollutants such as carbon dioxide. Economic analysis provides many valuable insights into the design and implementation of ET systems, especially on efficiency-related issues. However, with regard to topics outside its core competences, such as justice, economics needs to be complemented by contributions from other disciplines. After an overview of the economics of emissions trading, this chapter assesses ethical aspects of emissions trading as a showcase for how other disciplines can complement the economic approach. The chapter finds that the large majority of ethics-based objections to emissions trading are based on perceived problems of injustice. The only other such argument that can be consistently adduced is indulgence trade in carbon reduction; that is, that it matters, from an ethical perspective, who does the reducing.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-2333-7_8,"['Muller, Adrian']",Tackling Long-Term Global Energy Problems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-2333-7_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Because of their close connection with, and high dependence on, forest ecosystems and landscapes, indigenous and local communities are among the first to witness, understand, and experience the impacts of climate change on forests and woodlands as well as on their livelihoods and cultures. The history of forest and agricultural landscape management practices of indigenous and local communities based on their traditional knowledge offer insights into principles and approaches that may be effective in coping with, and adapting to, climate change in the years ahead. Global, regional, national and local efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, however, have not yet given adequate attention either to the forest-related knowledge and practices of traditional communities, or to the interests, needs and rights of local and indigenous communities in the formulation of policies and programmes to combat climate change.

The government administration has “two-faces”: a centrally-planned face and a competitive market-oriented face. The driving forces for the change are rapid economic development and sharp power shortages throughout the country. With this change, power groups and companies in China are reforming from national government-owned enterprises into economically-independent entities. These power groups and companies have been increasingly concerning government policies in energy-environment, including investment policy, income tax policy, tariff policy, emission mitigation policy. Conflicts between the national government and the power groups and companies are growing with the reform of the power industry. To resolve these conflicts, negotiations are taking place in capital distribution, income taxes, electricity tariffs, pollutant quota allocations, and will likely in emission trading. This chapter demonstrates some of China’s economic and power developments, power shortages, most important policies in the reforms of its power industry, power supply development issues, environment issues, etc. Then, it analyzes conflicts and negotiation issues in China’s power industry, and specifically describes two power groups which are used as negotiation actors in the case study.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4471-4057-3_3,"['Yang, Ming', 'Yang, Fan']",Negotiation in Decentralization,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-4057-3_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

877,Conclusions and Implications,"A methodological framework called Negotiation-coordination in Energy Environment Planning (NEEP) is systematically developed. The framework has been applied to the power systems of China to analyze two negotiation processes. Negotiation topics include power investments, power generation, electricity tariffs, and CO_2 emission mitigations and trading. Several conclusions and implications of the research are briefly summarized in this chapter. First, China’s reform from centralized planning mode to market economy oriented mode is a great success. Decentralization from socialism to socialism with Chinese characteristics in China’s reform is the key of the success. Integrative negotiations rather than government mandatory measures avoided major economic and social shocks that often lead to wastes of natural resources in a large scale and/or high inflations. China’s decentralized economic development system and investment mode has attracted a tremendous amount of capital from direct foreign investments, domestic companies, and their workers that have greatly contributed to China’s superior economic performance. Second, in energy-environment planning and policy research, many energy specialists now focus on the combination of macroeconomic model, energy demand model, energy supply model, and environment impact evaluation model, and so on. However, very few researchers have actually worked on the coordination process itself, taking into consideration of different actors on a quantitative basis within an energy system. This research fills the gap and to propose a methodological framework and some quantitative solutions to this problem. Third, this research indicates that China’s economic reform will continue over the next decades at least three areas: banking system, the oil and gas sector, and carbon trading. The methodological framework and negotiation simulations developed in this research will benefit the Chinese in these three areas.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4471-4057-3_6,"['Yang, Ming', 'Yang, Fan']",Negotiation in Decentralization,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-4057-3_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

879,"Sustainable Agriculture, Food Security, and Socio-Economic Risks in Ukraine","In Ukraine, the growth of intensive agricultural enterprises that focus on fast profits contribute considerably to food insecurity and increasing socio-economic and environmental risks. Ukraine has important natural and labor resources for effective rural development; more than 50% of food production is still contributed by small and medium farms, despite the difficulties associated with economic instabilities and the lack of proper policy support. Currently, the main issue for the agro-policy is to use these resources in a sustainable way, enforcing robust long term development of rural communities and agriculture. In this chapter, we introduce a stochastic, geographically explicit model for designing forward-looking policies regarding robust resources allocation and composition of agricultural production, in order to enhance food security and rural development. In particular, we investigate the role of investments into rural facilities to stabilize and enhance the performance of the agrofood sector in view of uncertainties and incomplete information.

883,The Cultural Silence of Climate Change Contrarianism,"This chapter presents a view of climate change from the perspective of green cultural criminology. The substantive focus of the chapter is on how climate change contrarianism is manifested in the mass media. Denial is profoundly ideological in nature; how it is conveyed and transmitted is of importance to those who wish to reorient collective thinking to not only recognizing the urgency and seriousness of the problem but also recasting it in criminal terms. As this chapter demonstrates, it is vital to understand and expose the dynamics and social construction of deception and “contrary” opinion if positive action is to be taken to address climate change issues.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-3640-9_4,"['Brisman, Avi']",Climate Change from a Criminological Perspective,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-3640-9_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

885,Issues and Implications of Carbon-Abatement Discounting and Pricing for Drinking Water System Design in Canada,"Water utilities generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when they construct, retrofit, and operate their water distribution systems. The prospect of introducing carbon-abatement strategies such as carbon pricing and using low discount rates for project planning could potentially change the manner in which water utilities plan and design their drinking water systems. The objectives of this paper are to: (i) Review the current issues and controversies surrounding the choice of discounting rate and carbon prices in Canada to reduce the GHG emissions linked to operating water systems in Canada; (ii) Review previous research that has examined the impact of discounting and carbon pricing on design decisions in water supply and distribution systems, and; (iii) Illustrate the possible implications of carbon-abatement strategies (discounting and carbon pricing) on the design of Canadian water systems by way of a real-world case study. The implications of discount rate and carbon price uncertainty on water distribution system design are illustrated with the Amherstview-Odessa water transmission system in Ontario, Canada. The results of the Amherstview study indicated that lowering discount rate led to significant increases in electricity costs. The study results also suggested that for a sufficiently low discount rate of 1.4%, increasing carbon price led to a larger pipe size and pipe cost to offset carbon costs levied on fossil-fuel based electricity to operated the pumps for the life of the system. Additional studies are needed on large-scale water systems to inform decisions on system upgrades taken by water utility managers.",2012-01-01,10.1007/s11269-011-9900-4,"['MacLeod, Stephanie P.', 'Filion, Yves R.']",Water Resources Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11269-011-9900-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Recently, the purpose of CAFE has been modified to help reduce carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions among the US automobile fleet. This analysis draws upon green criminology to examine the drawbacks of CAFE to reduce CO_2 emissions and proposes a vehicle-based carbon tax (V-CART) that offsets emissions with using carbon credits.

887,The European Union as a negotiator in the international climate change regime,"While the leadership role of the European Union (EU) in the climate change regime has been largely acknowledged, less attention has been paid to identifying the reasons why the EU often fails in climate change negotiations. Such an undertaking is deemed imperative following the negative for the EU turn of events at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit. There is sufficient literature to be found on the link between the Union’s unique and complex organizational structure and its inability to act cohesively and purposefully. This study seeks to add to this corpus by looking at the extent to which the EU has been able to learn from its mistakes and incorporate timely remedial action. Even though important, the EU’s failures as a global actor cannot be explained by only looking at its ineffective institutional architecture. A more systematic understanding of the reasons behind EU’s failures in climate talks is in fact needed. By using Underdal’s theory of ‘negotiation failure’, this study tries to explore the extent to which negotiation theory could help with better comprehending the obstacles that prevented the Union from getting more out of the climate negotiation process.",2011-11-01,10.1007/s10784-010-9135-5,"['Afionis, Stavros']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-010-9135-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
888,Endogenous market structures in non-cooperative international emissions trading,"The literature on cost-effective international emissions trading (IET) assumes exogenous market structures. This paper develops a game-theoretical model along with numerical simulations for the world economy in order to analyze the equilibrium market structures of an IET scheme. Countries’ decisions regarding the exercise of market power and their initial permit endowments are made non-cooperatively, being guided by their national self-interest. The theoretical results show that both price-influencing and price-taking countries choose an optimal permit endowment in light of their damage costs. Low-damage (high-damage) countries choose more emission permits and act as permit sellers (buyers). The numerical results further suggest that an imperfectly competitive IET market with all price-influencing countries being permit buyers (sellers) has lower (higher) emissions than a perfectly competitive IET market. Finally, the IET scheme has an equilibrium market structure of imperfect competition where the high-damage European Union acts as a unique price maker. This equilibrium imperfectly competitive IET has the lowest global emissions.",2011-08-01,10.1007/s11027-011-9287-9,"['Lee, Tsung-Chen']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-011-9287-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
889,"Daring to dream: reactions to tobacco endgame ideas among policy-makers, media and public health practitioners","Background Tobacco control strategies have mainly targeted reducing demand. Supply-side focused measures, though less familiar, deserve consideration, particularly to achieve 'endgame' tobacco control aims (e.g. achieving close to zero smoking prevalence). We explored attitudes towards supply-side focused 'endgame' tobacco control approaches and how they can be best communicated with senior policymakers, journalists, and public health practitioners. Methods We identified five supply-side focused approaches which could potentially lead to the tobacco endgame: two structural models and three discrete actions. The structural models were: (i) a Nicotine Authority to coordinate tobacco control activities and regulate the nicotine/tobacco market for public health aims; and (ii) a Tobacco Supply Agency acting as a monopoly purchaser of tobacco products and controlling the tobacco supply for public health aims. The actions were: (a) allocating progressively reducing tobacco product import quotas (the 'sinking lid') until importation and commercial sale of tobacco products ceased; (b) making tobacco companies responsible for reducing smoking prevalence with stringent financial penalties if targets were missed; and (c) new laws to facilitate litigation against tobacco companies. These approaches were presented as means to achieve a tobacco free New Zealand by 2020 to 19 senior policymakers, journalists, and public health physicians in two focus groups and eight interviews, and their reactions sought. Results The tobacco-free vision was widely supported. Participants engaged fully with the proposed tobacco control approaches, which were viewed as interesting or even intriguing. Most supported increasing the focus on supply-side measures. Views differed greatly about the desirability, feasibility and likely effectiveness of each approach. Participants identified a range of potential barriers to implementation and challenges to successfully advocating and communicating these approaches. The current framing of tobacco as a risky but legal commodity was noted as an important potential barrier to implementing endgame approaches. Conclusions Endgame tobacco control approaches were considered to be viable policy options. Further policy analysis, research and public discussion are needed to develop endgame approaches. A significant change in the public framing of tobacco may be a prerequisite for implementing endgame solutions.",2011-07-20,10.1186/1471-2458-11-580,"['Edwards, Richard', 'Russell, Marie', 'Thomson, George', 'Wilson, Nick', 'Gifford, Heather']",BMC Public Health,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/1471-2458-11-580,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
890,Environmental Horizon Scanning and Criminological Theory And Practice,"The world is rapidly changing due to climate change and the systematic depletion of natural resources. This paper provides a glimpse over the horizon of issues likely to be of interest to European criminology in the not so distant future. Our concern is to identify a set of issues and trends that have significant theoretical, methodological and policy implications for those with an interest in transnational environmental crime. The concerns range from the social consequences of climate change through to the use of the subterranean spaces of the planet as a toxic repository.

891,Climate change and mining in Canada,"Climate is an important component of the operating environment for the Canadian mining sector. However, in recent years mines across Canada have been affected by significant climatic hazards, several which are regarded to be symptomatic of climate change. For the mining sector, climate change is a pressing environmental threat and a significant business risk. The extent to which the mining sector is able to mitigate its own impact and adapt to climate change will affect its long-term success and prosperity, and have profound economic consequences for host communities. This paper draws upon case studies conducted with mining operations in Canada involving in-depth interviews with mining professionals and analysis of secondary sources to characterize the vulnerability of the Canadian mining industry to climate change. Five key findings are discussed: i) mines in the case studies are affected by climate events that are indicative of climate change, with examples of negative impacts over the past decade; ii) most mine infrastructure has been designed assuming that the climate is not changing; iii) most industry stakeholders interviewed view climate change as a minor concern; iv) limited adaption planning for future climate change is underway; v) significant vulnerabilities exist in the post-operational phase of mines. This paper argues for greater collaboration among mining companies, regulators, scientists and other industry stakeholders to develop practical adaptation strategies that can be integrated into existing and new mine operations, including in the post-operational phase.",2011-03-01,10.1007/s11027-010-9269-3,"['Pearce, Tristan D.', 'Ford, James David', 'Prno, Jason', 'Duerden, Frank', 'Pittman, Jeremy', 'Beaumier, Maude', 'Berrang-Ford, Lea', 'Smit, Barry']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-010-9269-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
892,Carbon Accounting in Greek Companies Participating in the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme: Current Practice and Projected Financial Implications,"Lack of a solid, uniform, efficient, and objective accounting background to record the economic impact of the tradable permits “grandfathered” to polluting companies misleads the users of corporate financial statements and hinders comparisons of performance. Further, it conceals the financial threat that an imminent need to purchase permits imposes on the profitability and competitiveness of companies participating in emissions trading schemes. The objectives were to investigate the way in which Greek companies record and treat transactions relating to carbon emissions allowances from an accounting perspective; and to predict the impact on corporate financial performance and economic prospects of future purchases of allowances. Data were collected by means of both primary research via questionnaires and telephone contacts and secondary research through the audited financial statements published by the sample corporations. Findings from research conducted in Greece in 2008 are presented and discussed. The working hypothesis was that in the following year, 2009, emissions trading scheme participants would have to purchase the currently free permits at the average stock exchange price established by market mechanisms. The role of variables, such as corporate size, sales, profitability, headcount, and asset base, was investigated to explain the choices and measure the significance of the impact.

894,Benefits of dealing with uncertainty in greenhouse gas inventories: introduction,"The assessment of greenhouse gases emitted to and removed from the atmosphere is high on the international political and scientific agendas. Growing international concern and cooperation regarding the climate change problem have increased the need for policy-oriented solutions to the issue of uncertainty in, and related to, inventories of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The approaches to addressing uncertainty discussed in this Special Issue reflect attempts to improve national inventories, not only for their own sake but also from a wider, systems analytical perspective—a perspective that seeks to strengthen the usefulness of national inventories under a compliance and/or global monitoring and reporting framework. These approaches demonstrate the benefits of including inventory uncertainty in policy analyses. The authors of the contributed papers show that considering uncertainty helps avoid situations that can, for example, create a false sense of certainty or lead to invalid views of subsystems. This may eventually prevent related errors from showing up in analyses. However, considering uncertainty does not come for free. Proper treatment of uncertainty is costly and demanding because it forces us to make the step from “simple to complex” and only then to discuss potential simplifications. Finally, comprehensive treatment of uncertainty does not offer policymakers quick and easy solutions. The authors of the papers in this Special Issue do, however, agree that uncertainty analysis must be a key component of national GHG inventory analysis. Uncertainty analysis helps to provide a greater understanding and better science helps us to reduce and deal with uncertainty. By recognizing the importance of identifying and quantifying uncertainties, great strides can be made in ongoing discussions regarding GHG inventories and accounting for climate change.

896,Uncertainty in Climate Policy – Impacts on Market Mechanisms,"In terms of geological shifts in climate, climate policy is a very young field. However, during the last two decades it has developed at a rapid pace. In 1987, the Brundtland Report first used the concept of sustainable development, followed in 1988 by the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Toronto. The establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992 marked the birth of global climate policy. For the first time in history governments of almost all nations gathered to discuss the effects and consequences of and measures to be taken against global warming and agreed on the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities”. The first decade of climate policy culminated in 1997 in the signing of the Kyoto Protocol, in which industrialized countries (37 so-called “Annex B countries”), agreed to reduce anthropogenic emissions of six greenhouse gases (GHGs) by 5.2% below 1990 levels during the Kyoto commitment period, 2008–2012 (Article 3, UNFCCC 1997).",2011-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-17700-2_5,"['Vasa, Alex', 'Michaelowa, Axel']",Climate Change and Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-17700-2_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
897,A Game of International Climate Policy Solved by a Homogeneous Oracle-Based Method for Variational Inequalities,"This paper presents a game-theoretic model for the international negotiations that should take place to renew or extend the Kyoto protocol beyond 2012. These negotiations should lead to a self-enforcing agreement on a burden sharing scheme to realize the necessary global emissions abatement that would preserve the world against irreversible ecological impacts. The model assumes a noncooperative behavior of the parties except for the fact that they will be collectively committed to reach a target on cumulative emissions by the year 2050. The concept of normalized equilibrium, introduced by J.B. Rosen for concave games with coupled constraints, is used to characterize a family of dynamic equilibrium solutions in an m -player game where the agents are (groups of) countries and the payoffs are the welfare gains obtained from a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. The model is solved using an homogeneous version of the oracle-based optimization engine (OBOE) permitting an implicit definition of the payoffs to the different players, obtained through simulations performed with the global CGE model GEMINI-E3.",2011-01-01,10.1007/978-0-8176-8089-3_23,"['Drouet, Laurent', 'Haurie, Alain', 'Vial, Jean-Philippe', 'Vielle, Marc']",Advances in Dynamic Games,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-0-8176-8089-3_23,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
898,Adaptation Strategies in Coping with Climate Change Impacts for Improved Crop Health and Sustainable Food Production,"In this chapter, historical climate information on rainfall, evaporation and temperature is compared with projections of these variables using outputs from the CSIRO Mk3 GCM for the A1B SRES scenario and stochastic downscaling models for two selected locations in Australia. The differences between current climatic parameters and those for 2030 and 2070 provide information on the changes in dependability of crop growing seasons. These analyses could also be used in identifying suitable strategies for adaptation to the projected climate change, and for evaluating alternate management options relating to excess and insufficient water during the growing season. These findings also have implications in resource management for mitigation purposes (e.g. the role of crop models in screening environments for growing of carbon sinks). The issue of the response of pests and diseases, and their interaction with host crops, to climate change is also considered. Information is required on the seasonal and geographic distributions of the occurrence and severity of pests and diseases for future climatic situations. We also report on current research aiming to integrate pathogen, crop and weather information for making tactical crop management decisions. Even though the study uses Australian data as a case study to test and validate the methodologies presented, it provides a generic framework and research directions which can easily be applied to other parts of the world including South Asia.

An Experimental Investigation,"This paper investigates whether climate negotiators have preferences for equity and whether these preferences may help to explain different positions in international climate policy. For this purpose we conducted an online experiment with individuals who had been involved in international climate policy. The experiment consisted of two simple non-strategic games suited to measure individual inequality aversion as captured by the equity preference model of Fehr and Schmidt (Quarterly Journal of Economics 114:817–868, 1999). We find that our participants show an aversion to advantageous inequality to a considerable extent while the aversion to disadvantageous inequality is moderate. Regarding the geographical variety in our sample, we cannot confirm significant differences in the degree of inequality aversion between different regions in the world. Our conclusion is that regional differences in addressing climate change are driven more by national interests than by different equity concerns.",2010-09-01,10.1007/s10640-010-9366-5,"['Dannenberg, Astrid', 'Sturm, Bodo', 'Vogt, Carsten']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-010-9366-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

One variable now commonly adopted is zero car ownership. This paper challenges the logic of including ‘not having a car’ as an indicator of disadvantage. It argues that this can distort the real picture of disadvantage. It presents evidence to show that zero car ownership can be a positive feature of low income households and that conversely high car ownership can put significant financial stress on households with low income.,2010-07-01,10.1007/s11205-009-9510-1,"['Johnson, Victoria', 'Currie, Graham', 'Stanley, Janet']",Social Indicators Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11205-009-9510-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

Our aim was to understand and quantify how different human-modified landscapes provide an essential ecosystem service: the exchange and storage of carbon in the landscape. Using a remote sensing based modelling methodology, we obtained values of Net Primary Productivity (NPP), total carbon in soil and biomass and carbon turnover from meteorological and terrain inputs and vegetation attributes. We obtained a set of maps of NPP, total carbon (C) storage and C-turnover for the ACR. We superimposed a land use/cover map to assign the uptake, storage and release of carbon to different land use/cover types.

907,Climate Change Mitigation Policy: An Overview of Opportunities and Challenges,"This chapter provides an overview of the opportunities and challenges associated with climate change mitigation policy, in order to achieve the target of limiting global average temperature rise to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Scenarios from the International Energy Agency and others show that a large number of mitigation ‘wedges’ from the large-scale deployment of a range of low-carbon technologies, including a range of renewable energy technologies, nuclear power and carbon capture and storage from coal- and gas-fired electricity generation, are likely to be needed. The Stern Review set out the economic case for climate change mitigation, arguing that the costs of mitigation are likely to be much smaller than the costs and risks of the impacts of climate change. Governments are now attempting to implement policies to deliver effective and efficient mitigation in three complementary areas: carbon pricing, through taxes or tradable permit schemes; increasing support for R&D, demonstration and early commercialisation of low-carbon technologies; and measures to overcome non-market barriers to the deployment of energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies. However, the rationales for these different types of mitigation policy come from different areas of economic theory, and it is argued that a more holistic framework may be needed to stimulate a transition to a low-carbon economy, drawing on new economic thinking, such as a ‘green fiscal stimulus’ or a global ‘green new deal’.",2010-01-01,10.1007/978-90-481-8716-4_12,"['Foxon, Timothy J.']","Changing Climates, Earth Systems and Society",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-90-481-8716-4_12,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
908,Financing Forests Sustainability from Ecosystem Values,"The chapter begins by suggesting that sustainable management has rarely been achieved in forests in the developing world not because the ­technologies for sustainable forest management are not viable, nor because resource managers do not recognize or understand the concept of sustainability. Rather, failure can be attributed to the fact that much of what happens in forests is determined by ­decisions made far from the forests sector, and to the fact that many of the actors in the forest sector (or nearby) are operating under perverse incentives. Attempts to quantify the non-marketed ecosystem values of forests have ­encountered major methodological problems, while the impacts of macroeconomic policies on forests vary considerably from one place to another, and there has been little fieldwork on this subject in specific locations. These constraints, added to the observation made in Chapter 6 that development assistance financing has not been adequate to value sustainable management highly in the eyes of the agents of forest change, illustrate the difficulty of implementing sustainable forest management in the recent past. Climate change, and increasing global awareness of the fragility of natural ­ecosystems is the potential game-changer here, and the remainder of the chapter explores the issues surrounding the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) mechanism which could finance sustainability via carbon emission trading from reduced deforestation, and an alternative approach based on public/private sector financing of forest ecosystems which does not rely on a ­specific trading mechanism, but does nevertheless apply value to retained forest carbon, among other assets.",2010-01-01,10.1007/978-90-481-9582-4_7,"['Douglas, Jim', 'Simula, Markku']",The Future of the World's Forests,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-90-481-9582-4_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
909,Cost Effective and Environmentally Safe Emission Trading Under Uncertainty,"The aim of this paper is to analyze robust cost-effective and environmentally safe carbon emission trading schemes under uncertainties of emissions and costs, and asymmetric information of participants. The proposed model allows to control explicitly the safety of Kyoto (or other) targets by taking long-term perspectives on emission trading. The dynamics of this scheme is driven by bilateral trades with different endogenous disequilibrium prices between mutually beneficial trades, but finally the system converges to cost-effective and environmentally safe global equilibrium. The safety constraints work as a discounting mechanism that discounts the reported emissions to detectable undershooting levels. This, in turn, provides incentives for participants to reduce uncertainties. The model shows that uncertainties and short term market perspectives may easily prevent price-based trading to be environmentally safe and cost-effective scheme. The desirable equilibrium emerges only under proper price-formation mechanisms. The role of the proposed computerized multi-agent trading system is central for dealing with long-term perspectives, irreversibility and lock-in equilibriums of trades. This system can be viewed as a device for decentralized collective regulation of trades based on unified approaches to modeling of uncertainty, calculation of costs and trading rules.",2010-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-03735-1_5,"['Ermolieva, T.', 'Ermoliev, Y.', 'Fischer, G.', 'Jonas, M.', 'Makowski, M.']",Coping with Uncertainty,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-03735-1_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
910,Game Analysis of Kyoto and Post-Kyoto Schemes,"Game theory is a tool utilized in economics to analyze the consequences of interaction among rational agents. It has been found to be especially useful for evaluating the workings of economic schemes at the theoretical level and also designing a possible mechanism to improve the economic system. In environmental economics, the use of game theory is most prominent in the analysis of IEAs (international environmental agreements), and the current negotiations on post-Kyoto (or post-2012) present a potential interesting application of game theory. Furthermore, such studies inspire further use of game theoretical tools in the study of such issues. In this chapter, we examine game theory analysis in this context and suggest some further directions of study with an emphasis on the role played by one particular mechanism under the Kyoto protocol (KP) called the CDM (clean development mechanism).",2010-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4419-1017-2_26,"['Imai, Haruo']",Global Warming,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-1017-2_26,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
911,Ionic Liquids in Biomass Processing,"Ionic liquids have been studied for their special solvent properties in a wide range of processes, including reactions involving carbohydrates such as cellulose and glucose. Biomass is a widely available and renewable resource that is likely to become an economically viable source of starting materials for chemical and fuel production, especially with the price of petroleum set to increase as supplies are diminished. Biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin may be converted to useful products, either by direct functionalisation of the polymers or depolymerisation to monomers, followed by microbial or chemical conversion to useful chemicals. Major barriers to the effective conversion of biomass currently include the high crystallinity of cellulose, high reactivity of carbohydrates and lignin, insolubility of cellulose in conventional solvents, as well as heterogeneity in the native lignocellulosic materials and in lignin itself. This combination of factors often results in highly heterogeneous depolymerisation products, which make efficient separation difficult. Thus the extraction, depolymerisation and conversion of biopolymers will require novel reaction systems in order to be both economically attractive and environmentally benign. The solubility of biopolymers in ionic liquids is a major advantage of their use, allowing homogeneous reaction conditions, and this has stimulated a growing research effort in this field. This review examines current research involving the use of ionic liquids in biomass reactions, with perspectives on how it relates to green chemistry, economic viability, and conventional biomass processes.",2010-01-01,10.1007/128_2008_35,"['Tan, Suzie Su Yin', 'MacFarlane, Douglas R.']",Ionic Liquids,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/128_2008_35,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
912,The New Climate Change Discourse: A Challenge for Environmental Sociology,"The chapter gives an analysis of the shifting social discourse on climate change in Germany and the U.S. Climate Change Discourses (CCD) are defined as thematically focused coupled sequences of arguments that different social actors use in order to influence one another or their social contexts in order to improve the chances of their resource endowments, interests, and worldviews to prevail in collective decision making processes. The major change in the recent CCD is seen as a shift from a framework of understanding the Earth System to a framework of decision making under uncertainties. The traditional (and in part ideological) opposition of mitigation and adaptation policies will have give way to an optimal mix of both. The chapter gives empirical evidence for that analysis from mass media coverage, public opinion, policy making, and the business sector. This shift occurs currently more markedly in Germany than in the U.S., will probably catch up across the Atlantic soon. The final section sketches the outlines of a low-carbon society and discusses some major challenges to environmental sociology such as more systemic views, active engagement in IPCC’s working group III, risk analysis of climate solutions, critical assessments of socio-technical experiments.",2010-01-01,10.1007/978-90-481-8730-0_3,"['Reusswig, Fritz']",Environmental Sociology,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-90-481-8730-0_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
913,Energy prices and emissions trading: windfall profits from grandfathering?,"The greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the European Union primarily uses grandfathering until 2012, which means that polluters get emission rights free of charge based on their historical emissions. Energy consumers accuse energy producers of making windfall profits by incorporating the market value of those free rights into the energy prices. However, we develop a numerical example to illustrate that the reasoning of the producers is correct. We also explain why this market value is only partly passed on to consumers.

916,Is environmental regulation bad for competition? A survey,"Theoretical and empirical research points to environmental regulation affecting the vigour of competition in product markets. We provide a critical, selective survey of that research. Environmental regulations can advantage large firms over small and raise concentration. They can discourage entry in their own right, and provide instruments with which incumbents can discourage entry strategically. They can provide the basis for predatory behavior by incumbents. Policy governance needs to be coordinated sufficiently to ensure that these secondary effects are accounted for in policy design.

917,A Global Review of Insurance Industry Responses to Climate Change,"A vanguard of insurers is adapting its business model to the realities of climate change. In many ways, insurers are still catching up both to mainstream science and to their customers, which, in response to climate change and energy volatility, are increasingly changing the way they construct buildings, transport people and goods, design products and produce energy. Customers, as well as regulators and shareholders, are eager to see insurers provide more products and services that respond to the “greening” of the global economy, expand their efforts to improve disaster resilience and otherwise be proactive about the climate change threat. Insurers are increasingly recognising the issue as one of “enterprise risk management” (ERM), one cutting across the domains of underwriting, asset management and corporate governance. Their responses are becoming correspondingly sophisticated. Based on a review of more than 300 source documents, plus a direct survey of insurance companies, we have identified 643 specific activities from 244 insurance entities from 29 countries, representing a 50 per cent year-over-year increase in activity. These entities collectively represent $1.2 trillion in annual premiums and $13 trillion in assets, while employing 2.2 million people. In addition to activities on the part of 189 insurers, eight reinsurers, 20 intermediaries and 27 insurance organisations, we identified 34 non-insurance entities that have collaborated in these efforts. Challenges and opportunities include bringing promising products and services to scale, continuing to identify and fill market and coverage gaps and identifying and confirming the veracity of green improvements. There is also need for convergence between sustainability and disaster resilience, greater engagement by insurers in adaptation to unavoidable climate changes and to clarify the role that regulators will play in moving the market. It has not yet been demonstrated how some insurance lines might respond to climate change and a number of market segments have not yet been served with a single green insurance product or service. As insurer activities obtain more prominence, they also will be subject to more scrutiny and expectations that they are not simply greenwashing.",2009-07-01,10.1057/gpp.2009.14,"['Mills, Evan']",The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance - Issues and Practice,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/gpp.2009.14,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
918,Environmental effectiveness and economic consequences of fragmented versus universal regimes: what can we learn from model studies?,"A post-2012 regime aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could develop towards a universal or fragmented regime. The fundamental difference between a universal and a fragmented regime is that the first involves a single comprehensive climate regime in which all countries participate, whereas the second involves either multiple treaties or a single treaty in which not all countries participate. This study assesses the literature on a wide range of different model studies concerning the environmental effectiveness and economic consequences of various universal and fragmented climate regimes. The most important conclusions (e.g. relative position of regions in terms of costs) are generally consistent across different studies, despite the differences in methodology. We conclude that stabilising GHG concentrations at low levels is more costly with a fragmented regime than with a universal regime, because reduction targets must be achieved by a smaller number of countries or because fragmented treaties may prevent reducing GHGs where it is cheapest to do so. However, establishing a universal regime will be challenging due to cost differences between regions if emissions are allocated based on specific allocation rules and incentives to free-ride on a universal regime. Even though alternative behaviours such as responsibility, the implementation of transfer schemes or exclusive membership can increase the likelihood of achieving a universal regime, a fragmented regime seems more feasible. Therefore, a transitional fragmented ‘coalition of the willing’ could be established first, which could provide the basis for a larger, universal regime in the long term.",2009-02-01,10.1007/s10784-008-9087-1,"['Hof, Andries F.', 'Elzen, Michel G.

920,Implications of CO_2 emissions trading for short-run electricity market outcomes in northwest Europe,"We examine the short-run implications of CO_2 trading for power production, prices, emissions, and generator profits in northwest Europe in 2005. Simulation results from a transmission-constrained oligopoly model are compared with theoretical analyses to quantify price increases and windfall profits earned by generators. The analyses indicate that the rates at which CO_2 costs are passed through to wholesale prices are affected by market competitiveness, merit order changes, and elasticities of demand and supply. Emissions trading results in large windfall profits, much but not all of which is due to free allocation of allowances. Profits also increase for some generators because their generation mix has low emissions, and so they benefit from electricity price increases. Most emission reductions appear to be due to demand response not generation redispatch.",2008-12-01,10.1007/s11149-008-9069-9,"['Chen, Yihsu', 'Sijm, Jos', 'Hobbs, Benjamin F.', 'Lise, Wietze']",Journal of Regulatory Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11149-008-9069-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

922,Reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in Annex I and non-Annex I countries for meeting concentration stabilisation targets,"The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Working Group III, summarises in Box 13.7 the required emission reduction ranges in Annex I and non-Annex I countries as a group, to achieve greenhouse gas concentration stabilisation levels between 450 and 650 ppm CO_2-eq. The box summarises the results of the IPCC authors’ analysis of the literature on the regional allocation of the emission reductions. The box states that Annex I countries as a group would need to reduce their emissions to below 1990 levels in 2020 by 25% to 40% for 450 ppm, 10% to 30% for 550 ppm and 0% to 25% for 650 ppm CO_2-eq, even if emissions in developing countries deviate substantially from baseline for the low concentration target. In this paper, the IPCC authors of Box 13.7 provide background information and analyse whether new information, obtained after completion of the IPCC report, influences these ranges. The authors concluded that there is no argument for updating the ranges in Box 13.7. The allocation studies, which were published after the writing of the IPCC report, show reductions in line with the reduction ranges in the box. From the studies analysed, this paper specifies the “substantial deviation” or “deviation from baseline” in the box: emissions of non-Annex I countries as a group have to be below the baseline roughly between 15% to 30% for 450 ppm CO_2-eq, 0% to 20% for 550 ppm CO_2-eq and from 10% above to 10% below the baseline for 650 ppm CO_2-eq, in 2020. These ranges apply to the whole group of non-Annex I countries and may differ substantially per country. The most important factor influencing these ranges above, for non-Annex I countries, and in the box, for Annex I countries, is new information on higher baseline emissions (e.g. that of Sheehan, Climatic Change, 2008 , this issue). Other factors are the assumed global emission level in 2020 and assumptions on land-use change and forestry emissions. The current, slow pace in climate policy and the steady increase in global emissions, make it almost unfeasible to reach relatively low global emission levels in 2020 needed to meet 450 ppm CO_2-eq, as was first assumed feasible by some studies, 5 years ago.",2008-12-01,10.1007/s10584-008-9484-z,"['den Elzen, Michel', 'Höhne, Niklas']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-008-9484-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

924,An oracle based method to compute a coupled equilibrium in a model of international climate policy,"This paper proposes a computational game-theoretic model for the international negotiations that should take place at the end of the period covered by the Kyoto protocol. These negotiations could lead to a self-enforcing agreement on a burden sharing scheme given the necessary global emissions limit that will be imposed when the real extent of climate change is known. The model assumes a non-cooperative behavior of the parties except for the fact that they will be collectively committed to reach a target on total cumulative emissions by the year 2050. The concept of normalized equilibrium, introduced by J.B. Rosen for concave games with coupled constraints, is used to characterize a family of dynamic equilibrium solutions in an m -player game where the agents are (groups of) countries and the payoffs are the welfare gains obtained from a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. The model deals with the uncertainty about climate sensitivity by computing an S -adapted equilibrium. These equilibria are computed using an oracle-based method permitting an implicit definition of the payoffs to the different players, obtained through simulations performed with the global CGE model GEMINI-E3.",2008-02-01,10.1007/s10287-007-0043-2,"['Drouet, Laurent', 'Haurie, Alain', 'Moresino, Francesco', 'Vial, Jean-Philippe', 'Vielle, Marc', 'Viguier, Laurent']",Computational Management Science,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10287-007-0043-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
925,Political Strategy and Climate Policy,"In the space of little more than two decades, climate change has been transformed from an obscure technical concern into an issue of major academic, political and public debate (Demeritt 2001: 307). As a result, reasonable degrees of confidence now exist on a number of key issues. Climate science has produced increasingly definitive statements about the existence, pace, extent and effects of human-induced climatic changes. The Stern Review, while contested in some quarters, provided strong indications that the economic costs of inaction or pure adaptation are likely greatly to outweigh those incurred by prompt and decisive action to cut and capture greenhouse gas emissions (Stern 2007). And various branches of the technical sciences and economics have developed innovative technologies and policy instruments to curb emissions. Despite these advances and sustained political attention, however, progress in cutting emissions remains disappointingly slow. The premise on which this book is based, and one that receives considerable support from the evidence reported in its constituent chapters, is that the main obstacles to more effective climate policies are essentially political: that, with a few exceptions, governments and other political authorities remain reluctant to take decisive action, even though most accept that strong measures are needed, because they fear that to do so would be politically damaging.",2008-01-01,10.1057/9780230594678_15,"['Compston, Hugh', 'Bailey, Ian']",Turning Down the Heat,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/9780230594678_15,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

927,The interaction between emissions trading and renewable electricity support schemes. An overview of the literature,"The public promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources coexists in many countries with the recent implementation of emissions trading schemes. As shown by several papers, this coexistence may lead to significant interactions between both instruments, in the form of synergies and conflicts. This paper provides an overview and analysis of the literature on such coexistence and interactions. A major conclusion is that policy measures aiming at exploiting the synergies between both instruments should be implemented. The greatest synergy effects from the use of both instruments take place through appropriate coordination of their targets. Another key finding is that, although some stylised facts can be inferred from the studies, some results from those complex interactions are context-specific since they depend on the design of the instruments in particular countries. In spite of the significant policy implications of such interactions for the effective and cost-effective functioning of both instruments, this is a surprisingly under searched field.

930,Modeling endogenous learning and imperfect competition effects in climate change economics,"In this two-part paper we evaluate the effect of “endogenizing” technological learning and strategic behavior of agents in economic models used to assess climate change policies. In the first part we show the potential impact of R&D policies or demonstration and deployment (D&D) programs in the context of stringent stabilization scenarios.

932,A Two-Level Differential Game of International Emissions Trading,"In this chapter we propose a dynamic game-theoretic modeling framework for the international climate change negotiations that should take place at the end of the Kyoto Protocol agreement if the necessity to drastically curb carbon emissions is confirmed. The model is composed of a set of optimal economic growth models corresponding to the different groups of nations that will be parties in the negotiations. Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are represented as by-products of the economic production process. Two types of capital (clean vs. dirty) can be used to produce the economic good with different emissions effects. The negotiations should determine a set of allowances that define caps on GHG emissions such that a long-term constraint on total emissions is satisfied. At each instant of time, given the emissions caps, an international emissions trading system is organized. In order to be self-enforcing, the emissions caps and the economic growth paths have to satisfy a noncooperative equilibrium condition. We describe this two-level game structure mathematically and give the necessary optimality conditions that must be satisfied by the equilibrium solution under the coupled global emission constraint.",2006-01-01,10.1007/0-8176-4501-2_16,"['Haurie, Alain', 'Moresino, Francesco', 'Viguier, Laurent']",Advances in Dynamic Games,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/0-8176-4501-2_16,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
933,Development and integration of new processes consuming carbon dioxide in multi-plant chemical production complexes,"Fourteen new energy-efficient and environmentally acceptable catalytic processes have been identified that can use excess high-purity carbon dioxide as a raw material available in a chemical production complex. The complex in the lower Mississippi River Corridor was used to show how these new plants could be integrated into this existing infrastructure using the chemical complex analysis system. Eighty-six published articles of laboratory and pilot plant experiments were reviewed that describe new methods and catalysts to use carbon dioxide for producing commercially important products. A methodology for selecting the new energy-efficient processes was developed based on process operating conditions, energy requirements, catalysts, product demand and revenue, market penetration and economic, environmental and sustainable costs. Based on the methodology for selecting new processes, 20 were identified as candidates for new energy efficient and environmentally acceptable plants. These processes were simulated using HYSYS, and a value-added economic analysis was evaluated for each process. From these, 14 of the most promising were integrated in a superstructure that included plants in the existing chemical production complex in the lower Mississippi River corridor (base case). The optimum configuration of plants was determined based on the triple bottom line that includes sales, economic, environmental and sustainable costs using the chemical complex analysis system. From 18 new processes in the superstructure, the optimum structure had seven new processes including acetic acid, graphite, formic acid, methylamines, propylene and synthesis gas production. With the additional plants in the optimal structure the triple bottom line increased from $343 million per year to $506 million per year and energy use increased from 2,150 TJ/year to 5,791 TJ/year. Multicriteria optimization has been used with Monte Carlo simulation to determine the sensitivity of prices, costs, and sustainability credits/cost to the optimal structure of a chemical production complex. In essence, for each Pareto optimal solution, there is a cumulative probability distribution function that is the probability as a function of the triple bottom line. This information provides a quantitative assessment of the optimum profit versus sustainable credits/cost, and the risk (probability) that the triple bottom line will meet expectations. The capabilities of the chemical complex analysis system have been demonstrated, and this methodology could be applied to other chemical complexes in the world for reduced emissions and energy savings.

934,"Kyoto, Europe?—An Economic Evaluation of the European Emission Trading Directive","To meet its obligations accepted in the Kyoto Protocol cost effectively, the European Union introduces a scheme of Greenhouse Gas Allowance Trading for its member states. This paper evaluates the cost effectiveness, ecological accuracy and dynamic incentives of this approach. The EU-emissions trading constitutes an important shift in the paradigm of environmental policy, from command and control to a market based approach. Still, the EU-system does not fully realize the economic potential of the transferable discharge permit policy. Especially, the limited scope of trading regarding geography, pollutants, sectors and activities reduces the quality of the system. Moreover, the EU-Directive is unspecific in many respects and it leaves many decisions defining the rules of the game to the individual member state.

936,Flexible Carbon Mitigation Policies: Analysis with a Global Multi-Regional MARKAL Model,"The Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR-Climate) explores the predictability, variability and risks of climate change and the socio-economic response to it. The Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) and the University of Geneva contribute to this programme by using models to simulate the impacts of policies for climate change mitigation. This study quantifies the benefits of several policies enhancing the flexibility of carbon dioxide (CO_2) mitigation, with emphasis placed on emissions trading, optimal timing paths and support for learning-by-doing (LBD) in the use of low-carbon technologies. We present illustrative results for a “Soft-landing” scenario, which imposes a CO_2-emission stabilization target that is consistent with stabilizing CO_2concentration at 550 ppmv in the long run. This analysis has been conducted with the Global MARKAL Model (GMM), which is a multi-regional, “bottom-up”, partial equilibrium energy-system model with endogenized technology learning (ETL). Incorporation of flexible CO_2mitigation policies leads to significant reductions in energy-system costs and marginal costs of CO_2abatement as well as increasing diffusion of advanced low-carbon technologies. In the future, an extended GMM model could be linked to a climate model (e.g., C-Goldstein, Marsh et al., 2002) to implement an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) that would allow examining impacts of climate change.",2005-01-01,10.1007/1-4020-3425-3_9,"['Rafaj, Peter', 'Kypreos, Socrates', 'Barreto, Leonardo']",The Coupling of Climate and Economic Dynamics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/1-4020-3425-3_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

We exploit the well recognized fact that the climate and economic Subsystems evolve at very different time scales. We formulate the international negotiation at the level of climate control as a piecewise deterministic stochastic game played in the “slow” time scale, whereas the economic adjustments in the different nations take place in a “faster” time scale. We show how the negotiations on emissions abatement can be represented in the slow time scale whereas the economic adjustments are represented in the fast time scale as solutions of general economic equilibrium models.

The latter would be necessary to avoid unequal changes of the financial positions between identical firms across the EU, thereby distorting competition, i.e. the “level playing field”.

The model includes a representation of the uncertainty concerning the date of entry of developing countries (e.g., China) on this market in the form of an event tree. Assuming that this date of entry is an uncontrolled event, we model the competition as a dynamic game played on an event tree and we look for a solution called S -adapted equilibrium. We compare the solution obtained from realistic data describing the demand curves for permits and the marginal abatement cost curves in different countries, under different market and information structures: (i) Russia's monopoly, (ii) Russia–China competition in a deterministic framework, (iii) Russia–China competition in a stochastic framework. The results show the possible impact of this competition on the pricing of emissions permits and on the effectiveness of Kyoto and post-Kyoto agreements, without a US participation.",2003-09-01,10.1023/A:1025599324868,"['Haurie, Alain', 'Viguier, Laurent']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1025599324868,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

The major issue of “hot air” and CDM transaction costs is examined using the CERT model to show that primary supply regions, typically those with “hot air” availability, might control the emissions reduction permit supply market and maximise net export revenues of permit supply by withholding 40 to 60% of available “hot air” credits. The assumption that primary permit suppliers control permit price via a restriction of “hot air” supply to the market will inadvertently leave a portion of the market share open to non-Annex B CDM supply, despite potentially extreme variance in CDM transaction costs.

To explore the economicpotential of biofuels in a greenhouse gasmitigation market, we incorporate data onproduction and biofuel processing for thedesignated energy crops switchgrass, hybridpoplar, and willow in an U.S. AgriculturalSector Model along with data on traditionalcrop-livestock production and processing, andafforestation of cropland. Net emissioncoefficients on all included agriculturalpractices are estimated through crop growthsimulation models or taken from the literature. Potential emission mitigation policies ormarkets are simulated via hypothetical carbonprices. At each carbon price level, theAgricultural Sector Model computes the newmarket equilibrium, revealing agriculturalcommodity prices, regionally specificproduction, input use, and welfare levels,environmental impacts, and adoption ofalternative management practices such asbiofuel production. Results indicate no rolefor biofuels below carbon prices of $40 perton of carbon equivalent.

943,International Regimes and Policy Strategies for Climate Change Control,"This paper analyses the link between effectiveness and efficiency of climate change policies and the structure and design of international environmental agreements (IEAs). The structure refers to the set of signatories to an IEA. The design refers to the aggregate abatement target agreed upon in an IEA, the distribution of the abatement burdens among signatories, the policy instruments used to implement abatement targets and possible compensation measures among signatories or between signatories and non-signatories. The paper argues that the design of an IEA has an immediate impact on global welfare and on the welfare of individual countries. Consequently, the design of an IEA affects countries’ decision about whether and which coalition they will join. However, the design of an IEA also affects the effectiveness and efficiency of policy strategies. Therefore, the effectiveness and efficiency of policy strategies are also linked to the structure of IEAs — a link that has been neglected so far in the literature. In order to take a first step to remedy this deficiency, this paper surveys the main results of two strands of the literature (game-theoretic analyses and cost-benefit studies), sketching the ingredients of an integrated analysis and indicating preliminary policy conclusions.",2003-01-01,10.1007/978-94-017-0333-8_1,"['Carraro, Carlo']",Environmental Policy in an International Perspective,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-017-0333-8_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer

The results show that the US withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol leads to no real emission reduction in all remaining Annex 1 regions. The results also indicate that the overall compliance costs of all remaining Annex 1 regions in the case of the former Soviet Union (FSU) cooperating with the Eastern European countries could reach as much as two times that in the case of only FSU acting as a monopoly. Moreover, curtailing permit supply by market power substantially increases the overall environmental effectiveness, although to much less extent than in the case of the US ratification.

945,Carbon Emissions Trading and Equity in International Agreements,"This paper explores the distributional consequences of alternative emissions trading schemes. It is argued that the distributional impact stems from the difference between two social welfare functions: the function which is implicitly maximised in a competitive market equilibrium and the function which is implicitly adopted when a given equity principle is chosen. An integrated assessment model is used to illustrate these findings, by simulating the introduction of various emissions trading schemes for the Kyoto protocol on the reduction of greenhouse emissions. It is shown that (1) changes produced on an equity index by the imposition of emission constraints (by country) may not be significantly higher than those obtained by the subsequent introduction of a market mechanism, and that (2) the various market regimes which could be adopted have quite different distributional implications.",2002-04-01,10.1023/A:1015218031905,"['Bosello, Francesco', 'Roson, Roberto']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1015218031905,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions trade"")",springer
946,"Equity, international trade and climate policy","The literature of welfare-maximising greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies pays remarkably little attention to equity. This paper introduces various ways to consider efficiency and equity simultaneously. Lower (higher) discount rates lead to higher (lower) emission reduction. Higher (lower) inequity aversion leads to higher (lower) emission abatement, unless one also considers the negative effects of OECD emission reduction on the exports of developing countries; in that case, the effect of inequity aversion is ambiguous. In the absence of international co-operation, higher (lower) risk aversion leads to lower (higher) emission abatement. With international co-operation, the effect of risk aversion is ambiguous because the higher risk aversion gives more weight to poorer regions and poorer generations. We analyse four ways to introduce compassion in a non-cooperative setting. If observed development aid is a guide, international altruism is small and has little impact on optimal emission control. If countries act as if they 'feel' but not 'physically experience' the climate impact of the most vulnerable country, optimal emission reduction increases, but not substantially so. However, if countries actually have to pay for the damage done, they would prefer to reduce their emissions to much lower levels. Finally, if countries pay as much for emission reduction as other countries suffer from climate change, (that is, if climate policy restores the income distribution to what it would have been without climate change), emissions are rapidly cut to very low levels.",2002-03-01,10.1023/A:1015034429715,"['Kemfert, Claudia', 'Tol, Richard S.

We examine the competitiveness of biomass‐based fuel for electrical power as opposed to coal using a mathematical programming structure. We consider fueling power plants from milling residues, whole trees, logging residues, switch grass, or short‐rotation woody crops. We do this using a combined model of the agricultural and forestry sectors.

949,Governing complexity: How can the interplay of multilateral environmental agreements be harnessed for effective international market-based climate policy instruments?,"Major new multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) have entered into force in 2016, including the Paris Agreement (PA) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with nationally determined contributions (NDCs) for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, the Kigali Amendment (KA) to the Montreal Protocol with a phase-down schedule for HFC production and use in all countries as well as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) under the International Civil Aviation Organization, an offset mechanism for GHG emissions. Regarding climate change mitigation, these MEAs are implicitly and explicitly linked to each other. However, the interaction effects between them have not yet been studied. We apply document analysis to assess the following question: how does the MEA interplay impact the scope and effectiveness of international market-based climate policy instruments defined in Article 6 of the PA (Paris Mechanisms) regarding NDC achievement? The Paris Mechanisms can generate early reductions in HFCs that lower the KA baseline and thus the entire phase-down schedule, thereby generating long-term GHG mitigation. Reduction in HFC-23—a large, controversial source of carbon credits under the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)—is now mandated through the KA and thus no longer available for international market mechanisms. If it accepts CDM credits predating 2020, CORSIA will not generate demand for emission units generated by the Article 6 mechanisms and thus not impact their effectiveness. Otherwise, CORSIA demand for Article 6 credits enhances effectiveness, provided that ‘double counting’ of credits is prevented through corresponding adjustments.",2019-12-01,10.1007/s10784-019-09455-6,"['Hoch, Stephan', 'Michaelowa, Axel', 'Espelage, Aglaja', 'Weber, Anne-Kathrin']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-019-09455-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions offset credit"")",springer

952,Payments for ecosystem services in relation to US and UK agri-environmental policy: disruptive neoliberal innovation or hybrid policy adaptation?,"This paper draws on ideas about policy innovation and adaptation to assess the extent to which ‘payments for ecosystem services’ (PES) can be seen as a challenge to traditionally more bureaucratic, state-centered ways of paying for the provisioning of environmental goods from agricultural landscapes through agri environmental policy (AEP). Focussing on recent experience in the United States and the UK, the paper documents the extent to which PES is now an established term of reference in AEP research and debate in both countries and postulates that this may usher in a new discourse of environmental provisioning in agriculture. The PES landscape is, however, currently highly fragmented and largely experimental, with ‘PES-like’ approaches being piloted in the field through partnerships between state agencies and localized private and charitable interests. State-supported AEP programs remain substantially intact, and rather than any displacement of state action, there appears to be a more gradual insertion of PES approaches and metrics into standard AEP operating procedures. This institutional stickiness is partly due to the continuing difficulty of agreeing the metrics necessary for measuring outcomes but may also be due to the politically well defended nature of traditional AEP entitlements and associated policy networks. We conclude by suggesting a need for further research to better understand these specifically political constraints and sources of resistance to PES and the ambiguous consequences for institutions, policy networks, rural communities and environment.",2014-09-01,10.1007/s10460-014-9518-2,"['Potter, Clive A.', 'Wolf, Steven A.']",Agriculture and Human Values,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10460-014-9518-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions offset credit"")",springer
953,Avoiding Emissions Reduction: Terrestrial Carbon Sinks,"As noted in previous chapters, it is not easy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions – it is technically difficult and the public is willing to pay too little to do so. As a result, governments have looked to land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities as a means of removing CO_2 from the atmosphere and sequestering it in terrestrial carbon sinks. This chapter considers economic issues related to, among others, discounting of carbon, questions pertaining to additionality and leakage, transaction costs, the process of certifying carbon offset credits, governance, and corruption. Available data suggest that, compared to emissions reductions, LULUCF activities are a costly alternative for mitigating climate change, although forestry activities in some regions might constitute an exception. Carbon sequestration and its costs are examined over a number of forest rotations encompassing 240 years; costs and carbon uptake depend on tree species, growth rates, the post-harvest use of fiber, and the discount rate. As shown in this chapter, tree-planting activities can be used to earn certified emission reduction (CER) credits under Kyoto’s Clean Development Mechanism, but the approach used to determine the CER differs from the actual carbon flux. Finally, although currently not permitted under Kyoto, activities that Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) are being promoted as eligible CER credits. This effort has gone even further, however, in the attempt to link the UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) and the Convention on Biological Conservation – the definition of REDD credits has been extended to include sustainable management of forests, forest conservation and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks, collectively known as REDD+.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-4988-7_9,"['Kooten, G.

955,"Economic Growth, Energy and Climate Change","Fossil fuels account for more than three-quarters of global energy consumption with another 10 % or more coming from renewable and waste sources that emit carbon dioxide. Energy consumption is projected to grow by some 50 % in the next quarter century, with the majority of this coming from sources that emit CO_2. While renewable sources of energy will play a greater role in the future, economic development will necessarily continue to rely on abundant and cheap fossil fuels, particularly coal and natural gas. In an era where climate change dominates the energy agenda, the prospects for expanding the use of CO_2-emitting sources of energy (oil, coal, natural gas) and relying more on hydroelectric, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and nuclear sources are examined. Economic policies in many jurisdictions use a combination of mandates and subsidies to reduce overall reliance on fossil fuels and/or promote generation of electricity from renewable sources. Lessons from biofuel programs, and an economic analysis of feed-in tariffs for electricity, indicate that they are not only expensive but generally ineffective. Despite the setback caused by the near meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, it is argued that nuclear energy is a safe alternative to many other forms of energy, and that, given the rebound effect associated with conservation and physical limits to the use of renewable energy, a natural gas-to-nuclear scenario might not be unrealistic future course of action.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-4988-7_10,"['Kooten, G.

956,"Local causes, regional co-operation and global financing for environmental problems: the case of Southeast Asian Haze pollution","Lack of action on cross-border environmental problems in developing countries is often ascribed to gaps in local capacity and resources, failure of regional cooperation and lack of financial support from rich countries. Using the case of the Southeast Asian Haze pollution from forest and peat fires in Indonesia, we explore the challenges posed by environmental problems whose causes are closely linked to local development and livelihood strategies, and whose impacts are local, regional (haze) as well as global (carbon emissions). We assess whether there are real opportunities to implement effectively the recent Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution. To address the deep determinants behind haze pollution, we propose signatories to the Agreement refocus their efforts to controlling peat fires rather than to strive for a zero-burning regime. We also recommend a new approach to financing sustainable development based on rules and incentives, with a regional pool of funds, contributed by rich countries through the Global Environment Facility and countries in Southeast Asia.",2008-03-01,10.1007/s10784-007-9057-z,"['Tacconi, Luca', 'Jotzo, Frank', 'Grafton, R.

Trade-Based Carbon Sequestration Accounting
","This article describes and illustrates an accounting method to assess and compare “early” carbon sequestration investments and trades on the basis of the number of standardized CO_2 emission offset credits they will provide. The “gold standard” for such credits is assumed to be a relatively riskless credit based on a CO_2 emission reduction that provides offsets against CO_2 emissions on a one-for-one basis. The number of credits associated with carbon sequestration needs to account for time, risk, durability, permanence, additionality, and other factors that future trade regulators will most certainly use to assign “official” credits to sequestration projects. The method that is presented here uses established principles of natural resource accounting and conventional rules of asset valuation to “score” projects. A review of 20 “early” voluntary United States based CO_2 offset trades that involve carbon sequestration reveals that the assumptions that buyers, sellers, brokers, and traders are using to characterize the economic potential of their investments and trades vary enormously. The article develops a “universal carbon sequestration credit scoring equation” and uses two of these trades to illustrate the sensitivity of trade outcomes to various assumptions about how future trade auditors are likely to “score” carbon sequestration projects in terms of their “equivalency” with CO_2 emission reductions. The article emphasizes the importance of using a standard credit scoring method that accounts for time and risk to assess and compare even unofficial prototype carbon sequestration trades. The scoring method illustrated in this article is a tool that can protect the integrity of carbon sequestration credit trading and can assist buyers and sellers in evaluating the real economic potential of prospective trades.",2004-08-01,10.1007/s00267-003-9112-7,"['King, Dennis M.']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-003-9112-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions offset credit"")",springer
958,"Land-Use Change, Carbon Sequestration and Poverty Alleviation","In this article, we seek to identify where the greatest potential for synergies between carbon sequestration and poverty alleviation lie and ways they can be enhanced. We assess the amount and eligibility criteria of sequestration payment sources to developing countries. Many land-use changes accessible to low-income land users are potentially competitive in a market where payments are likely to range between between $11 to $15 per carbon ton sequestered. We present a conceptual framework of land-use decision-making to assess the potential for sequestration adoption among the poor. The determinants of adoption vary according to the impact of adoption on the returns to productive factors in the absence of any payment for sequestration. Where sequestration leads to a decrease in returns, the key determinant is the return to sequestration and labor, which are driven by the potential sequestration supply per unit land area and labor-use requirements. When sequestration adoption leads to an increase in returns, barriers to land-use change are present, which is frequently the case for the poor. Adoption is determined by the capacity of sequestration payments to overcome constraints. Barrier removal may involve designing payments to overcome risk or investment constraints, or wider institutional reform. Sequestration values may be insufficient to cover costs of institutional reform, requiring incorporation into wider development programs. A survey of results from empirical studies lend support to the analysis. We conclude with an assessment of transaction cost impacts on sequestration adoption among the poor, and how these can be addressed.",2004-07-01,10.1007/s00267-003-9146-x,"['Lipper, Leslie', 'Cavatassi, Romina']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-003-9146-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions offset credit"")",springer
959,Exploring greenhouse gas mitigation strategies for agriculture in Africa: The case of Nigeria,"We used the Agriculture and Land Use National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Software to estimate the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the Nigerian agriculture sector in 2010. We went ahead to project future GHG emissions up to 2050. Two alternative GHG mitigation scenarios such as moderate (MS) and aggressive (AS) scenarios were developed and examined. Our results showed that total GHG emissions from Nigerian agriculture in 2010 were around 34.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. GHG emissions from livestock accounted for about 69.2 % of the total emissions, making it the largest source of GHG emissions in the sector. Nigeria’s agriculture GHG emissions are expected to increase by 94 % in 2050 relative to 2010 levels. Mitigation strategies in the Nigerian agriculture sector that do not compromise food security are limited. However, with the implementation of different GHG mitigation strategies in the alternative scenarios, emissions are expected to fall by around 13.2 % and 26.7 % by 2050 in the MS and AS, respectively, compared to the baseline scenario. While the mitigation potentials are significant, we argue that robust and dedicated policies are required to accelerate climate-smart agriculture in Nigeria.",2020-09-01,10.1007/s13280-019-01293-9,"['Dioha, Michael O.', 'Kumar, Atul']",Ambio,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13280-019-01293-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset trade"")",springer
960,"‘Sub-Prime’ Water, Low-Security Entitlements and Policy Challenges in Over-Allocated River Basins: the Case of the Murray–Darling Basin","Environmental policy is often implemented using market instruments. In some cases, including carbon taxing, the links between financial products and the environmental objectives, are transparent. In other cases, including water markets, the links are less transparent. In Australia’s Murray–Darling Basin (MDB), financial water products are known as ‘entitlements’, and are similar to traditional financial products, such as shares. The Australian water market includes ‘Low Security’ entitlements, which are similar to ‘sub-prime’ mortgage bonds because they are unlikely to yield an amount equal to their financial worth. Nearly half the water purchased under the Murray–Darling Basin Plan for environmental purposes is ‘Low Security’. We suggest that the current portfolio of water held by the Australian Government for environmental purposes reflects the mortgage market in the lead-up to the global financial crisis. Banks assumed that the future value of the mortgage market would reflect past trends. Similarly, it is assumed that the future value of water products will reflect past trends, without considering climate change. Historic records of allocations to ‘Low Security’ entitlements in the MDB suggest that, in the context of climate change, the Basin Plan water portfolio may fall short of the target annual average yield of 2075 GL by 511 GL. We recommend adopting finance sector methods including ‘hedging’ ‘Low Security’ entitlements by purchasing an additional 322–2755 GL of ‘Low Security’, or 160–511 GL of ‘High Security’ entitlements.

961,Potential for large-scale CO_2 removal via enhanced rock weathering with croplands,"A detailed assessment of the techno-economic potential of enhanced rock weathering on croplands identifies national CO_2 removal potentials, costs and engineering challenges if it were to be scaled up to help meet ambitious global CO_2 removal targets. Enhanced silicate rock weathering (ERW), deployable with croplands, has potential use for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO_2) removal (CDR), which is now necessary to mitigate anthropogenic climate change^ 1 . ERW also has possible co-benefits for improved food and soil security, and reduced ocean acidification^ 2 – 4 . Here we use an integrated performance modelling approach to make an initial techno-economic assessment for 2050, quantifying how CDR potential and costs vary among nations in relation to business-as-usual energy policies and policies consistent with limiting future warming to 2 degrees Celsius^ 5 . China, India, the USA and Brazil have great potential to help achieve average global CDR goals of 0.5 to 2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO_2) per year with extraction costs of approximately US$80–180 per tonne of CO_2. These goals and costs are robust, regardless of future energy policies. Deployment within existing croplands offers opportunities to align agriculture and climate policy. However, success will depend upon overcoming political and social inertia to develop regulatory and incentive frameworks. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of ERW deployment, including the potential for excess industrial silicate materials (basalt mine overburden, concrete, and iron and steel slag) to obviate the need for new mining, as well as uncertainties in soil weathering rates and land–ocean transfer of weathered products.",2020-07-09,10.1038/s41586-020-2448-9,"['Beerling, David J.', 'Kantzas, Euripides P.', 'Lomas, Mark R.', 'Wade, Peter', 'Eufrasio, Rafael M.', 'Renforth, Phil', 'Sarkar, Binoy', 'Andrews, M.

962,Hypothesis for a Risk Cost of Carbon: Revising the Externalities and Ethics of Climate Change,"Standard market-based policies for addressing climate change mostly aim to internalize the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) into the economy with either carbon taxes or cap-and-trade schemes. Standard policies are failing to manage the systemic risk of dangerous-to-catastrophic climate change for a variety of reasons. In this chapter we clarify and expand on a market hypothesis that argues for a second externalized cost of carbon, called the Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC), as the appropriate solution to this risk problem. The combination of the SCC and RCC creates a new paradigm of complementary market pricing for the dual objectives of improving market efficiency and managing systemic risk, respectively. Introducing the RCC addresses the problem of how to decouple gross world product (GWP) from carbon emissions and how to solve the paradox of time discounting under systemic risk. Subsequently the RCC could have major implications for climate change economics, public policy, and sustainability theory. The hypothesis is novel by taking into consideration both the entropy and the mass of the carbon budget. The RCC is technically defined as the cost of imposing risk tolerances (%) on climate mitigation objectives, and it has units of USD per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO_2e) mitigated. The RCC is internalized with a “global carbon reward” that manages a trade-off between market efficiency and climate certainty. The carbon reward is issued as a parallel currency and with an exchange rate that is managed by central banks over a rolling 100-year planning horizon. A key recommendation is to test the hypothesis with experiments.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-03152-7_8,"['Chen, Delton B.', 'Beek, Joel', 'Cloud, Jonathan']",Understanding Risks and Uncertainties in Energy and Climate Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-03152-7_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset trade"")",springer

964,Emissions Trading,"Climate change is being exacerbated by the emissions of globe-warming greenhouse gases (GHGs) as a consequence of economic activities associated with energy, industry, transportation, and land use. From an economic viewpoint, the Earth’s climate is a public good , and pollution a negative externality ; such change therefore constitutes market failure . Controlling air pollution by utilizing economic mechanisms represents an important change in environmental thinking – literally a paradigm shift away from historical command-and-control engineering systems. Today, this approach is being utilized to mitigate the emissions of GHGs, addressing the pollution externality by putting a price on carbon. The international carbon market, largely developed as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, had a total value of $176 billion in 2011, but it has decreased significantly in recent years. With the addition of China and other national and subnational programs, however, it is expected that it will once again increase, as a larger and larger portion of emitted GHGs come under such regulatory purview. Historically, the largest component of that market has been the European Union’s Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which represents a regional market designed first to assist Europe in achieving compliance with the Protocol’s requirements, and now is a cornerstone of the EU’s policy to combat climate change. It also has links to the Protocol’s project-based mechanisms, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI), which help minimize compliance costs. China’s nascent market – currently seven pilot schemes, but expected to become a national program in 2016 – should ultimately become twice as large as the EU ETS. Other carbon markets created in numerous countries (e.g., the U.S., Japan, South Korea, etc.) as well as a voluntary market are also expected to make significant contributions.

965,Green economy and carbon markets for conservation and development: a critical view,"Green economy aims to use economic rationality and market mechanisms to mute the most ecologically damaging effects of globalized capitalism while reviving economic growth in the global North, fostering development in the South, and decoupling economic growth from environmental decline. An archetypal application of green economy is transnational trade in ecosystem services, including reduced emissions for deforestation and degradation (REDD+). By compensating developing countries for maintaining forests as carbon sinks, this approach is meant to transcend politics and circumvent conflicts over the responsibilities of industrialized and ‘less-developed’ countries that have stymied global climate policy. However, carbon-offset trading is unlikely to result in lower greenhouse gas emissions, much less combined conservation and development gains. The troubled record of payment for environmental services and other schemes or commodification of nature illustrates that living ecosocial systems do not fit the requirements of market contracts. Disputes over proto-REDD+ projects point to the dangers that REDD+ will disadvantage or dispossess rural communities and distract attention from underlying causes of forest and livelihood loss. Two decades of all-but-futile climate negotiations have shown that global warming cannot be managed by means of technocratic expertise nor dealt with separately from the politics of inequality and the paradox of economic growth. The deceptive promise of greening with growth can blind us to these realities. Counter-hegemonic discourses to growth-centered green economy under the headings of buen vivir , mainly in the global South, and degrowth , mainly in the global North, therefore merit attention.",2016-06-01,10.1007/s10784-015-9295-4,"['McAfee, Kathleen']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-015-9295-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset trade"")",springer

Introduced as an instrument to fight climate change, carbon offsetting constitutes a market mechanism in which financial support of emission-reduction projects is exchanged for tradable carbon credits. These credits are an artificial commodity based on the absence of emissions and are called carbon offsets (Knox-Hayes 2013).

967,The Economic Impact of Climate Change on Cash Crop Farms in Québec and Ontario,"This chapter examines the economic impact of alternative climate change scenarios on representative cash crop farms in Quebec and Ontario. Mixed Integer Dynamic Linear Programming models were used to determine the annual optimal land and labour allocations over a 30 year time horizon. In the modeling process, five climate scenarios were modeled, along with different combinations of CO_2 enhancement and water limitation. Parameters, such as crop prices, costs of production, and crop yields, were simulated and projected into the future using various methods, such as Monte Carlo simulation, Crystal Ball Predictor and the Decision Support System for Agro-Technology Transfer cropping system model. Rotation and diversification constraints, as well as participation in public risk management programs were also incorporated into the optimization procedures. The results indicate that the economic impact of climate change varied by climate scenario, climate condition and region. Climate condition, i.e. CO_2 enhancement and water limitation, had a larger impact on net farm income than the climate scenarios. Technology development, in terms of crop variety improvement as well as the public insurance programs in terms of individual crop insurance, income stabilization insurance and AgriInvest, are adaptation strategies that can contribute to reducing the economic vulnerability to climate change.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-31392-4_5,"['Thomassin, Paul J.', 'An, Ning']",Agricultural Adaptation to Climate Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-31392-4_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset trade"")",springer
968,Conservation Agriculture and Climate Change,"This chapter review aims at developing a clear understanding of the impacts and benefits of conservation agriculture (CA) with respect to climate change, and examining if there are any misleading findings at present in the scientific literature. Most of the world’s agricultural soils have been depleted of organic matter and soil health over the years under tillage-based agriculture (TA), compared with their state under natural vegetation. This degradation process can be reversed and this chapter identifies the conditions that can lead to increase in soil organic matter content and improvement in soil health under CA practices which involve minimum soil disturbance, maintenance of soil cover, and crop diversity. The chapter also discusses the need to refer to specific carbon pools when addressing carbon sequestration, as each carbon category has a different turnover rate. With respect to greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable agricultural systems based on CA principles are described which result in lower emissions from farm operations as well as from machinery manufacturing processes, and that also help to reduce fertilizer use. This chapter describes that terrestrial carbon sequestration efficiently be achieved by changing the management of agricultural lands from high soil disturbance, as TA practices to low disturbance, as CA practices, and by adopting effective nitrogen management practices to provide a positive nitrogen balance for carbon sequestration. However, full advantages of CA in terms of carbon sequestration can usually be observed only in the medium to longer term when CA practices and associated carbon sequestration processes in the soil are well established.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-11620-4_22,"['Pisante, M.', 'Stagnari, F.', 'Acutis, M.', 'Bindi, M.', 'Brilli, L.', 'Di Stefano, V.', 'Carozzi, M.']",Conservation Agriculture,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-11620-4_22,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset trade"")",springer
969,Maintaining and Enhancing Ecological Carbon Sequestration,"Terrestrial ecosystems sequester large amounts of organic carbon (C) in their pools of living and dead biomass. Management actions that increase C uptake and storage in ecological C pools, or that reduce C release from them, contribute to a society’s climate change mitigation objectives. They do this by reducing the rate of accumulation of CO_2 and its radiative equivalents in other greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. Trading systems for GHG credits recognize the validity of ecological offset projects that result in increased C storage in the living and/or dead organic matter of ecosystems. In some circumstances, projects that reduce C release from existing high-C ecosystems are also considered to provide legitimate offsets. Some ecological carbon-offset projects have been criticized from a variety of perspectives, but the problems can mostly be dealt with by means of improved regulations and management actions. In addition to their contribution to climate change mitigation, projects that maintain or accumulate ecological carbon offsets often result in important co-benefits through the conservation of biodiversity and non-carbon environmental services, which are also important societal goals. The co-benefits are, however, much less substantial for projects based on intensively managed ecosystems, such as no-till agroecosystems and plantation forests, compared with those that restore or maintain habitats that are more natural in character.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5784-4_12,"['Freedman, Bill']",Global Environmental Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5784-4_12,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset trade"")",springer

971,Forest Carbon Credits Generation in Brazil: The Case of Small Farmers,"A literature review was made to identify and discuss obstacles that Brazilian small farmers face to develop a CDM project. Technical and economic issues are the main barriers to the participation of small farmers in these project types. Small farmers’ low education and restrictive income associated with the projects’ vast bureaucracy and high transaction costs makes their insertion in this market difficult. To overcome these challenges is necessary to guarantee access to information and specialised technical assistance and to ensure financing opportunities. Projects destined to voluntary carbon market, REDD+ and PES programmes would be desirable alternatives. Forest carbon credits generation focused on small farmers is an opportunity to harness Brazil’s forestry potential, alleviate poverty and improve ecological conditions of degraded areas.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5176-7_20,"['Ribeiro, Sabina Cerruto', 'Jacovine, Laércio Antônio Gonçalves', 'Vilar, Mariana Barbosa']",Governing the Provision of Ecosystem Services,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5176-7_20,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset trade"")",springer
972,The potential for carbon offset trading to provide added incentive to adopt silvopasture and alley cropping in Missouri,"Global carbon trading may present a unique opportunity to change the rural landscape by allowing landowners to make an environmental impact with financial incentives. By enticing point source polluters to trade to an optimal level of pollution by offsetting their emissions with compatible carbon reduction projects, markets are able to facilitate a cleaner environment. Agroforestry provides a set of practices that can sequester carbon with managed tree and crop plantings. However, the initial lack of financial resources has been an obstacle to its adoption in the United States. This paper explores the potential for carbon offset trading to provide an added incentive to adopt agroforestry practices. Chicago Climate Exchange carbon sequestration projects are used as a baseline assessment, and the requirements that Missouri landowners would need to do in terms of contracting and ownership are identified. Data from landowners in central Missouri and the Ozarks (353 individuals) are used to determine characteristics of potentially interested landowners in agroforestry. A model to evaluate agroforestry profitability scenarios is used to compare the added carbon credit trading revenue to traditional alternate uses for the property. The findings from this analysis indicate that in the current context carbon trading does not provide an added incentive value for Missouri landowners to adopt either silvopasture or alley cropping practices because of the low magnitude of annual return.",2012-11-01,10.1007/s10457-012-9543-3,"['Holderieath, Jason', 'Valdivia, Corinne', 'Godsey, Larry', 'Barbieri, Carla']",Agroforestry Systems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10457-012-9543-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset trade"")",springer

976,Emissions Trading,"Climate change is being exacerbated by the emissions of globe-warming greenhouse gases (GHGs) as a consequence of economic activities associated with energy, industry, transportation, and land use. From an economic viewpoint, the Earth’s climate is a public good , and pollution a negative externality ; such change therefore constitutes market failure . Controlling air pollution by utilizing economic mechanisms represents an important change in environmental thinking – literally a paradigm shift away from historical command-and-control (CAC) engineering systems. Today, this new approach is being utilized to mitigate the emissions of GHGs, addressing the pollution externality by putting a price on carbon. The international carbon market, largely developed as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, had a total value of $144 billion in 2009. The largest component of that market, the European Union’s Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), was worth $118 billion; it represents a regional market designed to assist Europe in achieving compliance with the Protocol’s requirements, and also has links to the Protocol’s project-based mechanisms, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI) which help minimize compliance costs. These project-based components themselves were valued at $2.7 billion and $354 million, respectively. Further, other carbon markets created in numerous countries (e.g., the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative [RGGI] in the USA and the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme in New South Wales, Australia) were worth $2.3 billion, while the global voluntary market was estimated to be in the $350–$400 million range (a significant drop from the previous year’s $700 million figure).

977,Mitigating Climate Change Through Small-Scale Forestry in the USA: Opportunities and Challenges,"Forest management for carbon sequestration is a low-cost, low-technology, relatively easy way to help mitigate global climate change that can be adopted now while additional long-term solutions are developed. Carbon-oriented management of forests also offers forest owners an opportunity to obtain a new source of income, and commonly has environmental co-benefits. The USA is developing climate change policy that recognizes forestry as a source of offsets in carbon markets, and the emissions trading programs and standards that have developed to date offer opportunities for afforestation, reforestation, reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and improved forest management projects. Private forest owners are key players in carbon markets because they own over half of the forest land in the USA and carbon offsetting from public forest land is rare. However, a number of environmental, economic, and social constraints currently limit carbon market participation by forest owners. Key issues include: the low price of carbon and high cost of market entry; whether small landowners can gain market access; how to meet requirements such as management plans and certification; and whether managing for carbon is consistent with other forest management goals. This paper provides an overview of current and emerging opportunities for family forest owners to contribute to climate change mitigation in the USA, and explores ways of overcoming some of the challenges so that they can take advantage of these opportunities.",2010-12-01,10.1007/s11842-010-9135-x,"['Charnley, Susan', 'Diaz, David', 'Gosnell, Hannah']",Small-scale Forestry,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11842-010-9135-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset trade"")",springer
978,Financing Forests Sustainability from Ecosystem Values,"The chapter begins by suggesting that sustainable management has rarely been achieved in forests in the developing world not because the ­technologies for sustainable forest management are not viable, nor because resource managers do not recognize or understand the concept of sustainability. Rather, failure can be attributed to the fact that much of what happens in forests is determined by ­decisions made far from the forests sector, and to the fact that many of the actors in the forest sector (or nearby) are operating under perverse incentives. Attempts to quantify the non-marketed ecosystem values of forests have ­encountered major methodological problems, while the impacts of macroeconomic policies on forests vary considerably from one place to another, and there has been little fieldwork on this subject in specific locations. These constraints, added to the observation made in Chapter 6 that development assistance financing has not been adequate to value sustainable management highly in the eyes of the agents of forest change, illustrate the difficulty of implementing sustainable forest management in the recent past. Climate change, and increasing global awareness of the fragility of natural ­ecosystems is the potential game-changer here, and the remainder of the chapter explores the issues surrounding the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) mechanism which could finance sustainability via carbon emission trading from reduced deforestation, and an alternative approach based on public/private sector financing of forest ecosystems which does not rely on a ­specific trading mechanism, but does nevertheless apply value to retained forest carbon, among other assets.",2010-01-01,10.1007/978-90-481-9582-4_7,"['Douglas, Jim', 'Simula, Markku']",The Future of the World's Forests,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-90-481-9582-4_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset trade"")",springer
979,Final Thoughts,"This chapter draws some overarching observations from what has gone before in this book, framed in the context of a more general paradigm linking social, cultural and environmental change. We follow some new work on these large issues which suggests that creating institutions to meet the challenge of sustainability is the most critical task confronting society; these institutions will need to be capable of integrating the various ecological, economic and social disciplines in a way that will allow continual adaptation to cycles of growth, accumulation, restructuring and renewal. We suggest that in this new era, the primary reason for slowing global deforestation is that without this, there will be little chance of bringing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases down to the levels needed to avoid catastrophic climate change. Dealing effectively with life in the Anthropocene is going to involve assigning high global priority to getting this done – especially for the tropical rainforests much more effectively than we have managed to do so far. In this sense, the forest carbon product – combined with a broader set of forest ecosystem values – represents a new opportunity; one which has the potential to fundamentally re-order the economic priorities of forest management and use at a global scale. We will need to see this for what it is – a market opportunity. The crux of what needs to be done is to more effectively link finance and capital – those creations of the last renaissance which have powered both the best and the worst of our historical trajectory since then – to the natural forest systems, and ongoing human interactions with those systems, to shift the dynamic towards sustainability. Inevitably, we believe, this will require a much larger role for international private sector investment than has hitherto been the case. This approach may raise concerns in some quarters, related to the role of international donor assistance institutions, the perceived need to protect biodiversity as a goal in itself, and addressing equity and rights issues as a priority. We acknowledge these concerns, but we maintain the argument that has underlain much of what has been written in this book: more compromise, and changes in approach are going to be necessary. Many of the criticisms we have raised of historical efforts of the international forests constituency to implement forest sustainability and reduced deforestation in the past – inconsistency and lack of coordination, inadequate financing, and the pursuit of ideological and unrealistic solutions – will remain as constraints under a new approach to this problem, unless there is new resolve on the part of all significant players to not allow the perfect to continue to get in the way of the good.",2010-01-01,10.1007/978-90-481-9582-4_8,"['Douglas, Jim', 'Simula, Markku']",The Future of the World's Forests,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-90-481-9582-4_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset trade"")",springer

Each year, forests covering an area the size of Portugal (approximately 92,000 km^2) are cut down. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that during the 1990s, the world suffered a net loss of 95 million hectares of forests – an area larger than Venezuela – with most of the losses occurring in the tropics.

Trade-Based Carbon Sequestration Accounting
","This article describes and illustrates an accounting method to assess and compare “early” carbon sequestration investments and trades on the basis of the number of standardized CO_2 emission offset credits they will provide. The “gold standard” for such credits is assumed to be a relatively riskless credit based on a CO_2 emission reduction that provides offsets against CO_2 emissions on a one-for-one basis. The number of credits associated with carbon sequestration needs to account for time, risk, durability, permanence, additionality, and other factors that future trade regulators will most certainly use to assign “official” credits to sequestration projects. The method that is presented here uses established principles of natural resource accounting and conventional rules of asset valuation to “score” projects. A review of 20 “early” voluntary United States based CO_2 offset trades that involve carbon sequestration reveals that the assumptions that buyers, sellers, brokers, and traders are using to characterize the economic potential of their investments and trades vary enormously. The article develops a “universal carbon sequestration credit scoring equation” and uses two of these trades to illustrate the sensitivity of trade outcomes to various assumptions about how future trade auditors are likely to “score” carbon sequestration projects in terms of their “equivalency” with CO_2 emission reductions. The article emphasizes the importance of using a standard credit scoring method that accounts for time and risk to assess and compare even unofficial prototype carbon sequestration trades. The scoring method illustrated in this article is a tool that can protect the integrity of carbon sequestration credit trading and can assist buyers and sellers in evaluating the real economic potential of prospective trades.",2004-08-01,10.1007/s00267-003-9112-7,"['King, Dennis M.']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-003-9112-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset trade"")",springer
982,Challenges of predicting gas transfer velocity from wind measurements over global lakes,"Estimating air–water gas transfer velocities ( k ) is integral to understand biogeochemical and ecological processes in aquatic systems. In lakes, k is commonly predicted using wind-based empirical models, however, their predictive performance under conditions that differ from their original calibration remains largely unassessed. Here, we collected 2222 published k estimates derived from various methods in 46 globally distributed lakes to (1) evaluate the predictions of a selection of six available wind-speed based k models for lakes and (2) explore and develop new empirical models to predict k over global lakes. We found that selected k models generally performed poorly in predicting k in lakes. Model predictions were more accurate than simply assuming a mean k in only 2–39% of all lakes, however, we could not identify with confidence the specific conditions in which some models outperformed others. We developed new wind-based models in which additional variables describing the spatial coverage of k estimates and the lake size and shape had a significant effect on the wind speed- k relationship. Although these new models did not fit the global dataset significantly better than previous k models, they generate overall less biased predictions for global lakes. We further provide explicit estimates of prediction errors that integrate methodological and lake-specific uncertainties. Our results highlight the potential limits when using wind-based models to predict k across lakes and urge scientists to properly account for prediction errors, or measure k directly in the field whenever possible.",2020-05-01,10.1007/s00027-020-00729-9,"['Klaus, Marcus', 'Vachon, Dominic']",Aquatic Sciences,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00027-020-00729-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions offset carbon"")",springer
983,Source or Sink? Carbon Dynamics in Eastern Old-Growth Forests and Their Role in Climate Change Mitigation,"For decades forest scientists have thought that old-growth temperate forests were either carbon neutral or even carbon sources, emitting more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition than they were absorbing through photosynthesis. However, recent research has questioned that assumption, showing that eastern old-growth forests may remain productive and have net positive carbon uptake later into succession and stand development than previously thought. These findings remain contentious and yet have profound implications for our understanding of the role of high-biomass, late successional forests in global carbon budgets. Emerging science strongly supports conservation of old-growth forests and management for old-growth structure as effective strategies in global efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and moderate the intensity of future climate change (Luyssaert et al. 2008; Keith et al. 2009; Burrascano et al. 2013).",2018-01-01,10.5822/978-1-61091-891-6_14,"['Keeton, William S.']",Ecology and Recovery of Eastern Old-Growth Forests,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.5822/978-1-61091-891-6_14,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions offset carbon"")",springer
984,Growth rates of Eucalyptus and other Australian native tree species derived from seven decades of growth monitoring,"There is widespread interest in estimating and forecasting individual tree and forest growth rates for restoration and carbon sequestration objectives. Outside intensively managed forests, past attempts have been limited by the lack of accurate long-term monitoring in multi-age mixed native forests to provide estimates of both expected mean diameter increments and the statistical variation in those estimates. A dataset from Eucalyptus -dominated native forests in subtropical Queensland, Australia offers an opportunity to provide accurate estimates of tree and forest growth rates. Over 86,400 trees from 155 native species were identified and remeasured between 1936 and 2011 in 641 permanent sample plots across a 500–2000 mm mean annual rainfall gradient. Individual tree diameter at breast height (DBH) increments observed for all species ranged mainly from 0.01 to 0.5 cm yr^−1 (94 % of values), with consistent differences between rainfall zones (mean of 500–2000 mm yr^−1), and varying differences between species (155) and stem diameter class (10–100 cm). For some species, diameter increment increased progressively with rainfall (e.g. Eucalyptus siderophloia , Eucalyptus propinqua , and Lophostemon confertus ), but in others (e.g. Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata , Corymbia intermedia, and Eucalyptus biturbinata ) the greatest diameter increments were recorded between 1200 and 1600 mm yr^−1. Where there were sufficient data, most species exhibited a quadratic relationship between DBH increment and DBH class, but two species ( Callitris glaucophylla and Eucalyptus crebra ) native to the 500–800 mm annual rainfall zone showed linear increases in DBH increment with increasing DBH. Continued monitoring of these plots would add to their already great value.",2015-12-01,10.1007/s11676-015-0095-z,"['Ngugi, Michael R.', 'Doley, David', 'Cant, Mark', 'Botkin, Daniel B.']",Journal of Forestry Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11676-015-0095-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions offset carbon"")",springer
985,World Food Security: The Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy,"Over 1.02 billion people in the world suffer from hunger today. Securing world food security in light of the impact of climate change may be one of the biggest challenges we face in this century. Agriculture is extremely vulnerable to climate change. Rising temperatures, more intense droughts, floods, and greater weather variability all mean productivity losses to crops and livestock. Greater numbers of crop failures, livestock deaths, forest fires, damage to fishery infrastructure are already imposing economic losses and undermining food security. The overall impacts of climate change on agriculture are expected to be negative, threatening global food security. Impacts of climate change can influence the whole food supply chain and all four dimensions of food security, namely: availability of food from domestic ­production and imports, access to resources for producing or buying food, stability of food supply, both ecological and macroeconomic, utilization of food, including consumer preferences and safety of water and food. The poor will be disproportionably vulnerable to the effects of climate change because of their greatest dependence on agriculture and their lower ability to adapt. In parallel, growing energy demand is adding additional string and could compete with food security objectives. The importance of addressing the question of how to increase the resilience of present food production systems to challenges posed by climate change is widely recognized. As importance to bioenergy is growing, the challenges and ­opportunities posed by biofuels, in view of the world’s food security, energy and sustainable development needs to be addressed.

986,References to literature from the business sector in patent documents: a case study of charging technologies for electric vehicles,"Expansion of government R&D budgets on promoting electric vehicle (EV) adoption and charging infrastructure development is likely to continue to be a key component of ecological innovation policies. Using an original data set of non-patent literature (NPL) references extracted from patent documents pertaining to EV charging technologies, this paper provides new evidence on the flows of knowledge with or without a scientific contribution from the business sector. Three main questions are addressed in this paper for exploring whether different patterns of knowledge flows emerge between contributions involving academics and or the business sector not only contributes towards a better understanding of the interrelations between scientific and technological fields regarding EV charging but also serves the purpose of fostering more partnerships and unlocking further investments in research. First, what information facilitates knowledge flow from science to technology? NPL references with authors from the business sector have received a lower number of patent citations on average, and universities still occupy the primary locus of knowledge production. However, patents citing firm publications have a particular focus on technologies relating to stations and rail vehicles and have a broader scope, a larger family size, more claims and forward citations compared to others on average. Second, are there any differences between the types of author contributions? Firms’ collaborations with academia in NPL references contribute to an even higher index, while the patents published between 2001 and 2005 with citations to collaborative scholarly works from the business sector have been cited less than the others. Finally, how are non-patent citations relevant to assignments of patents and patent applications, as well as other events that affect title or patent ownership? Patents citing firm publications in general have fewer assignments, but more on average and patents citing collaborative works are more likely to be changed in titles or ownerships. The role of firm publication needs to be further explored in a border technological field considering its specific relevance both to generating applied technologies and technology transfer as indicated by EV charging patents.",2020-08-01,10.1007/s11192-020-03518-1,"['Qu, Zhao', 'Zhang, Shanshan']",Scientometrics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11192-020-03518-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
987,Nitrogen Tax and Set-Aside as Greenhouse Gas Abatement Policies Under Global Change Scenarios: A Case Study for Germany,"The ambitious climate policy objectives of the COP21 agreement require the design and the implementation of effective and efficient policy instruments. The effectiveness and efficiency of agricultural abatement options depend on regional climate and natural conditions, changes in the global economy, global agricultural markets and regional agricultural production. Thus, the assessment of abatement options requires consideration of the global scale, the market scale and the regional producer scale. We investigate two abatement options discussed controversially in literature. Both have been partially applied to reduce environmental pollution from agriculture: a tax on nitrogen and the obligatory set-aside of agricultural land. Our study provides an assessment of the ecological effectiveness and the economic efficiency of both abatement options under different global scenarios. In our policy analysis we combine three applied policy simulation models to develop an integrated economic model framework. This model framework considers the global, the national and the regional scale and consists of the global general equilibrium model DART-BIO, the partial-equilibrium model CAPRI and the regional supply model RAUMIS. In the different global scenarios, the results show that both abatement options create relatively high marginal abatement costs and that the maximally reached abated greenhouse gas emissions represent only 15% of the quantity required to fulfill the policy targets. Compared to the obligatory set-aside option, the nitrogen tax is in both scenarios the more efficient policy. With respect to impacts on production and environment, a nitrogen tax is less forecastable than the obligatory set-aside option. Our study illustrates the relevance of considering global economic and market change in the assessment of producer-targeting environmental policies.",2020-07-01,10.1007/s10640-020-00425-0,"['Henseler, Martin', 'Delzeit, Ruth', 'Adenäuer, Marcel', 'Baum, Sarah', 'Kreins, Peter']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-020-00425-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

Evidence from belt and road countries,"This study examines the effect of financial development (FD) and foreign direct investment (FDI) on the environmental quality for the panel of 90 belt and road countries from 1990 to 2017. This study advances the knowledge of financial development by using the new comprehensive index, which is based on access, depth, and efficiency of financial markets and financial institutions and incorporated foreign direct investment as an important determinant of environmental quality. By applying the Driscoll-Kraay standard error pooled ordinary least square method, the empirical findings reveal that FD deteriorates the environmental quality by increasing the CO_2 emissions, while FDI improves environmental quality and the relationship between economic growth (EG) and CO_2 emissions is inverted U-shaped, i.e., presence of EKC hypothesis. The energy consumption and urbanization pollute the environment, while trade openness enhances the quality of the environment. Furthermore, the Dumitrescu-Hurlin (DH) panel causality test result confirms that the bidirectional causality exists among FD, trade openness, energy consumption, and urbanization with CO_2 emissions.

989,Energy-based industrial symbiosis: a literature review for circular energy transition,"Nowadays, industrial symbiosis (IS) is recognized as a key strategy to support the transition toward the circular economy. IS deals with the (re)use of wastes produced by a production process as a substitute for traditional production inputs of other traditionally disengaged processes. In this context, this paper provides a systematic literature review on the energy-based IS approach, i.e., IS synergies aimed at reducing the amount of energy requirement from outside industrial systems or the amount of traditional fuels used in energy production. This approach is claimed as effective aimed at reducing the use of traditional fuels in energy production, thus promoting a circular energy transition. 682 papers published between 1997 and 2018 have been collected, and energy-based IS cases have been identified among 96 of these. As a result of the literature review, three categories of symbiotic synergies have been identified: (1) energy cascade; (2) fuel replacement; and (3) bioenergy production. Through the review, different strategies to implement energy-based IS synergies are highlighted and discussed for each of the above-mentioned categories. Furthermore, drivers, barriers, and enablers of business development in energy-based IS are discussed from the technical, economic, regulatory, and institutional perspective.

Today Homo sapiens has turned itself into a major geological force, able to cause a biodiversity crisis comparable to previous mass extinction events, shaping the Earth surface and impacting biogeochemical cycles and the climate at a global level. We argue that anthropogenically-driven climate change must be understood in terms of a monumental niche construction process, generating long-term ecological inheritance and eco-evolutionary feedbacks that are putting our health and well-being and those of future generations at risk. We then list five major sources of climate change counter-intuitiveness, highlighting how evolved cognitive biases and heuristics may stand in the way of providing effective responses within tight deadlines. Drawing on our framing of the climate breakdown, we finally call for an evolutionary perspective in approaching the adaptive challenge posed by climate change: we argue that putting the brakes on a genuine self-endangering evolutionary trap ultimately depends on our counteractive niche constructing abilities, played at the level of our institutional and innovation capacity.",2020-06-29,10.1007/s10539-020-09754-2,"['Meneganzin, Andra', 'Pievani, Telmo', 'Caserini, Stefano']",Biology & Philosophy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10539-020-09754-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
991,"Environmental evaluation and optimization of energy use and greenhouse gases mitigation for farm production systems in Mashhad, Iran","The current paper aimed at evaluating and optimizing the efficiency of energy use and mitigation of environmental pollution by minimizing the emissions and intensity of greenhouse gases (GHG) for farm production systems in Mashhad, Iran. The results indicated that the total values of consumed energy were equal to 28,648, 38,479, and 43,490 MJha^−1 for barley, canola, and forage corn, respectively. The highest rate of the consumed energy for all crops belonged to irrigation electricity, diesel fuel, and nitrogen consumption. The highest and lowest energy efficiencies were respectively achieved from forage corn and canola, while barley production led to the lowest GHG emissions. The estimation of GHG intensity demonstrated that canola with 53% took up the highest intensity, which was followed by barley (30%) and forage corn (17%). Since the intensity of GHG takes into account the amount of energy produced by each crop per hectare, this index is more suitable than GHG emissions for assessing environmental pollution. The results of optimal responses of the multiple goal programming (MGP) model revealed that the optimum evaluated cultivation areas (for meeting the goals of the study) for barley and forage corn were 10,088 and 3256 ha, respectively, while the MGP model generally eliminates canola from the cultivation plan. On the other hand, the plan proposed by the MGP model increases the total energy efficiency from 103,625 for the current systems to 105,169 for the optimized systems per year. Furthermore, the emissions and intensity of GHG were reduced by the model to 311,786 kgCO_2eq and 10 kgCO_2eq MJoutput^−1 per year, respectively.",2020-06-26,10.1007/s11356-020-09778-x,"['Taleghani, Abolfazl', 'Almassi, Morteza', 'Ghahderijani, Mohammad']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-09778-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
992,Movement and Retention of NH_4-N in Wetland Rice Soils as Affected by Urea Application Methods,"A field experiment was conducted to investigate the dynamics of ammonium nitrogen (NH_4^+-N) in the soil during an entire rice-growing season. The NH_4^+-N dynamics were measured in paddy soils from two N application methods, namely, urea deep placement (UDP) and broadcast prilled urea (PU). The pore water samples from a 10 cm soil depth were collected using a “rhizon sampler.” The samples were collected at 0, 7, 10, 14, 20, and 22 cm from the urea briquette (UB) placement point at 7, 14, 21, 35, 64, and 83 days after transplanting (DAT) of rice. The NH_4^+-N in the floodwater sample was measured for a week after each split application of PU. UDP retained NH_4^+-N at the placement site (7–10 cm depth) until 64 DAT. A small amount of NH_4^+-N moved horizontally up to 14 cm from the placement site. It’s movement to the soil surface and floodwater was very low to negligible. In contrast, PU produced more NH_4^+-N in both the floodwater and in the soil surface. Therefore, broadcast urea had significantly ( p  < 0.05) higher ammonia volatilization (~15% of applied N) compared to UDP (<1%). UDP significantly ( p  < 0.05) increased grain yields, N uptake, and N recovery compared to broadcast urea. These results confirm that a single application of UDP could meet plants’ N demand throughout the rice-growing period, particularly for short- and medium-duration rice varieties.",2020-06-01,10.1007/s42729-019-00148-2,"['Siddique, Imran Ahammad', 'Mahmud, Abdullah', 'Hossain, Mahmud', 'Islam, M.

993,Macro-economic analysis of green growth policies: the role of finance and technical progress in Italian green growth,"The transition to a low-carbon economy is a complex process that, from a technical perspective, requires coordination of different market players, significant technology advancements and sufficient financial resources. The transition to a low-carbon energy system is a capital intensive process. Different technological options at different scales and different time frames will be required for the successful transition to a low-carbon energy system. The economic impact on countries that transform their energy system depends on a multitude of factors including their energy system profile, the access to low-cost financial resources, whether they are market leaders in the production of clean energy technology and their ability to assimilate knowledge that is produced elsewhere. In this study, we use a large scale applied CGE model to compute the macroeconomic implications of the investments required to reduce by 76% as compared to 1990 levels the GHG emissions of the Italian energy system within a context of global concerted GHG mitigation action. The focus of the analysis has been on the Italian economy and energy system as Italy is both an equipment manufacturer, its energy system is largely based on fossil fuels and its financial system is currently under pressure following the elevation of public debt and deficits. The model-based results suggest that the Italian economy can benefit from the low-carbon transition in the coming decades in case Italian firms and households have access to low-cost financial resources, Italian manufacturers acquire market shares in the production of clean energy technologies and technological progress is rapid driven by innovation and economies of scale. The average annual GDP growth of Italy in the period 2015–2050 can be 1.3% in the case that Italy reduces drastically its GHG emissions and the associated cumulative expenditures sum up to one trillion euro.",2020-06-01,10.1007/s10584-019-02543-1,"['Paroussos, Leonidas', 'Fragkiadakis, Kostas', 'Fragkos, Panagiotis']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-019-02543-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
994,Economic motivation for raising coastal flood defenses in Europe,"Extreme sea levels (ESLs) in Europe could rise by as much as one metre or more by the end of this century due to climate change. This poses significant challenges to safeguard coastal communities. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of economically efficient protection scenarios along Europe’s coastlines during the present century. We employ a probabilistic framework that integrates dynamic simulations of all ESL components and flood inundation, impact modelling and a cost-benefit analysis of raising dykes. We find that at least 83% of flood damages in Europe could be avoided by elevating dykes in an economically efficient way along 23.7%-32.1% of Europe’s coastline, specifically where high value conurbations exist. The European mean benefit to cost ratio of the investments varies from 8.3 to 14.9 while at country level this ranges between 1.6 and 34.3, with higher efficiencies for a scenario with high-end greenhouse gas emissions and strong socio-economic growth. There lacks a European cost-benefit analysis of possible protective measures against rising seas. Here the authors used a probabilistic data and modeling framework to estimate costs and benefits of coastal protection measures and found that at least 83% of flood damages could be avoided by dyke improvements along a third of the European coastline.",2020-05-05,10.1038/s41467-020-15665-3,"['Vousdoukas, Michalis I.', 'Mentaschi, Lorenzo', 'Hinkel, Jochen', 'Ward, Philip J.', 'Mongelli, Ignazio', 'Ciscar, Juan-Carlos', 'Feyen, Luc']",Nature Communications,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15665-3.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
995,Proposed Sustainability Composite Index of Highway Infrastructure Projects and Its Practical Implications,"Highway infrastructure projects always have negative impacts on the sustainable development objectives. However, the construction of these projects will not be stopped due to their importance for the fulfillment of the nations’ economic, social and civilization development. Hence, it is necessary to find solutions for improving their performance toward the sustainability approach. One of these solutions is to quantify the highway projects’ sustainability before starting in their execution. This will guide the decision-makers to adopt the suitable alternative and policy for the development of sustainable highway infrastructure. Previous studies did not adequately integrate the sustainable development dimensions in the construction of highway infrastructure projects, which represents an obstacle to the effective evaluation of highway projects’ sustainability. Addressing this issue, this research proposes an integrated index capable of appraising the sustainability performance of highway projects. The research data were collected from a questionnaire survey conducted with Egyptian experts with lengthy experience in the construction of highway infrastructure projects. Fuzzy set theory and the analytic hierarchy process were utilized to develop the composite highway sustainability index (CHSI). A case study was conducted to elucidate application of CHSI.

996,Evaluation of the Electrical Energy Potential of Woody Biomass in the Near Region of the Hydropower Plant Tucuruí-Brazil,"This paper determines the potential of installing power plants fired with wood residues generated at the sawmills located in the region of a 8 GW hydropower complex in the Amazon. Two different scenarios were considered: (i) the residues are converted locally at the mills or (ii) transported to a centralized power plant. To evaluate the existing electricity potential, sawmills were contacted and the amount and type of generated residues assessed. The LHV (lower heating value) of wood of native species processed at the mills was experimentally determined. Data from real biomass power plants was fitted to calculate efficiencies versus power. With LHV data and conversion efficiency, the potential of installing micro to large-scale biomass-fired power plants was estimated. In 2004 and 2014, sawmills around the Tucuruí dam generated 404 × 10^3 t of wood residues, showing that in the region there is a large untapped potential for energy valorization. If the residues were converted at the mills, 57 GWh_e could be annually produced. The energy production would be around two times higher in the centralized scenario. The importance of the efficiency in determining biomass potentials or optimizing biomass supply chains is quantified.

997,Mind the gap: Coping with delay in environmental governance,"Gaps between public policy goals and the state of the environment are often significant. However, while goal failures in environmental governance are studied in a number of disciplines, the knowledge on the various causes behind delayed goal achievement is still incomplete. In this article we propose a new framework for analysis of delay mechanisms in science and policy, with the intention to provide a complementary lens for describing, analysing and counteracting delay in environmental governance. The framework is based on case-study findings from recent research focusing on goal-failures in policies for climate change, hazardous chemicals, biodiversity loss and eutrophication. It is also related to previous research on science and policy processes and their interactions. We exemplify the framework with two delay mechanisms that we consider particularly important to highlight—denial of science and decision thresholds. We call for further research in the field, for development of the framework, and not least for increased attention to delay mechanisms in environmental policy review and development on national as well as international levels.",2020-05-01,10.1007/s13280-019-01265-z,"['Karlsson, Mikael', 'Gilek, Michael']",Ambio,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13280-019-01265-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

We also check for the moderating effects of local labor market composition in the relation between GPP and green innovation capacity. Lastly, we test for differential effects of GPP on different classes of green technologies (GTs). The main finding is that GPP is an important driver for the local generation of GTs. High availability of abstract skills in the local workforce also drives the generation of GTs and magnifies the positive effect of GPP.

999,Tar content and composition during a low-temperature steam gasification of rice husks,"The research work extends our recent empirical knowledge on the rice husks, a carbonaceous solid material. This solid biofuel option was characterized with a potential net heating value of 16–17 MJ/kg, significant high ash deformation temperature recorded above 1450 °C, capable and considerable for thermochemical conversion systems. An experimental performance on a dual fluidized bed steam gasifier using rice husks pellets was carried out at a low temperature between 600 and 650 °C and fuel power of 100 kW_th. Pure steam was used as a gasification agent in fluidization at a steam to fuel ratio of 1.2 kg/kg on dry basis. Calcite with mainly CaCO_3 in composition was used as bed material for the reactor. Tar content and composition in the product gas stream were analyzed with a gas chromatograph coupled with mass spectrometer (GC–MS).

1000,Assessment of energy saving potential and CO_2 abatement cost curve in 2030 for steel industry in Thailand,"The master plan of energy management for Thailand iron and steel industry has been proposed by Iron and Steel Institute of Thailand (ISIT). Three plausible scenarios in the master plan were S1: without integrated steel plant (baseline scenario), S2: with a traditional integrated BF–BOF and S3: with an alternative integrated DR-EAF. This study investigated the potential of energy reduction and CO_2 emission reduction in 2030 under two reduction target scenarios which were scenario A: to achieve ISIT'S plan and scenario B: maximum energy reduction. Moreover, the CO_2 abatement cost curve and the sensitivity analysis of the abatement cost with different interest rates were studied. By following the baseline scenario (S1), the potential of energy reduction and CO_2 reduction was 12.74 million GJ and 1.28 million tCO_eq. The traditional integrated BF–BOF route (S2) exhibited the highest energy saving and CO_2 reduction potential, followed by S3 (DR-EAF) and S1 (baseline). The maximum energy reduction and CO_2 reduction could be increased 11.8% and 17.9% from the ISIT’s plan. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the change of interest rates (3.27, 4.27 and 5.27%) affected the abatement cost ranged from − 21 to + 24% when compared with the long-term interest rate of 4.27%.",2020-03-23,10.1007/s10668-020-00691-4,"['Juntueng, Sirintip', 'Towprayoon, Sirintornthep', 'Chiarakorn, Siriluk']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-020-00691-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1001,Pig barns ammonia and greenhouse gas emission mitigation by slurry aeration and acid scrubber,"Livestock production is associated with several gaseous pollutant emissions to the environment. These emissions can degrade local and regional air quality, contribute to surface water eutrophication and acid rain, and contribute to the greenhouse gas footprint of the production sector. Modern production systems must balance animal welfare and environmental pollution potential with economic reality, which is a great challenge to maintain as global demand for animal protein increases. Accordingly, gaseous emission technologies were the main target for this research, in which mitigating gas emissions of ammonia, nitrous oxide, and methane from pig production facilities via slurry aeration system was tested. Five treatments with different airflow rates in the test room were examined continuously over a period of 6 weeks and the results were compared with the control room. Test results indicate that the highest mitigation potentials were 12, 57.6, and 10.4% for nitrous oxide, methane, and ammonia, respectively. Subsequently directing exhaust air into a sulfuric acid air scrubber at 3.0 pH further reduced total ammonia emissions by 80 to 87%.",2020-03-01,10.1007/s11356-020-07613-x,"['Mostafa, Ehab', 'Selders, Anne', 'Gates, Richard S.', 'Buescher, Wolfgang']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-07613-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1002,A new approach to explain farmers’ adoption of climate change mitigation measures,"The determinants of farmers’ decisions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are currently not well understood. This study takes several new angles in investigating farmers’ climate change mitigation behaviour. Based on two identical surveys among representative samples of Dutch farmers, this study examines the underlying determinants and motivating factors for three different types of climate change mitigation measures on farms: energy saving, the production of renewable energy and reduction of emissions of methane and nitrous oxide (non-CO_2 emissions). Furthermore, the study explores whether farmers’ awareness and behaviour has been influenced by a communication campaign carried out by the government of the Netherlands between 2012 and 2015. Four major conclusions emerge. Firstly, the analyses demonstrate that accounting for the cost-effectiveness and technology readiness level (TRL) of different types of climate change mitigation measures provides for a better understanding of the factors that motivate farmers to adopt these measures. Secondly, neither the willingness to take GHG reduction measures nor knowledge on GHG emissions are consistent motivating factors for energy-related measures. Thirdly, it seems that external factors, such as economic hardship, dominate the overall environmental awareness of farmers. Fourthly, the farmer’s propensity to innovate proved to be the strongest and most consistent predictor of both the willingness and the actual adoption of climate change mitigation technologies. Therefore, focusing on making farmers more open to change and general innovation in campaigns in the agricultural sector might be more effective than campaigns focusing specifically on climate change mitigation.",2020-03-01,10.1007/s10584-019-02595-3,"['Moerkerken, Albert', 'Blasch, Julia', 'Beukering, Pieter', 'Well, Erik']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-019-02595-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1003,Future private car stock in China: current growth pattern and effects of car sales restriction,"Car stock projection is essential to evaluating the energy and environmental impacts of private cars in China. Since the private car ownership rate in China has not reached its saturation level, limited and outdated data used in previous studies has resulted in high uncertainties regarding the functions of car ownership and significantly reduced the robustness of the projection of private car stocks. In this work, we estimate China’s current growth pattern of private car ownership by analyzing more than 6300 pairs of private car ownership and income data collected from various official statistics at the national, provincial, and city levels in the period of 1997–2017. The dataset covers a much wider per-capita disposable income range than national-level data alone and allows us to make satisfactory projections of private car stocks in China up to 2040. We project that the private car stock in China could reach 403 million in 2040, if the current growth pattern of car ownership continues. Significant discrepancies in private car ownership curves are observed for cities with and without car sales restrictions. Without car sales restrictions, we estimate that the private car stock would be even higher at 455 million by 2040, demonstrating the effectiveness of the current restriction policy in controlling car stocks in China. We further quantify the potential impacts of car sales restrictions on future car stock levels by implementing hypothetical national car sales caps. Results show that, although the private car stocks would still continue to grow before 2030, the stock levels would be stable at ~ 280 and ~ 350 million by 2040 for scenarios of 20 and 25 million sales caps, respectively. The impact of private car stock growth on energy consumption in China is also examined. Pump-to-wheels energy consumption of the private car fleet is projected to be 131, 147, 90, and 113 million tonnes of oil equivalent by 2040 for scenarios of the current growth pattern, no sales restriction, the 20 million sales cap, and the 25 million sales cap, respectively. Analysis reveals that private car sales restriction and vehicle population growth control could be an effective strategy for energy consumption reduction (thus greenhouse gas emission mitigation) in China, although the development of the automotive industry may be restrained.",2020-03-01,10.1007/s11027-019-09868-3,"['Gan, Yu', 'Lu, Zifeng', 'Cai, Hao', 'Wang, Michael', 'He, Xin', 'Przesmitzki, Steven']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-019-09868-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

By characterizing the equilibrium strategy of each region we show that the regions’ best responses can be strategic complements through a dynamic complementarity effect. The model is then used to analyze the impact of adaptation assistance from North to South. It is shown that North’s unilateral assistance to South (thus enhancing South’s adaptation capacity) can facilitate pollution mitigation in both regions, especially when the assistance is targeted at labor protection. Pollution might increase in the short run, but in the long run the level of pollution will decline.

1006,Strategic sectors for greenhouse gas mitigation investment: assessment based upon the Brazil’s input-output matrix,"Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing the international community. The year 2017 was one of the three warmest on record and the world continues to experience extreme weather conditions. An effective mobilization of resources earmarked for key economic sectors is an important component of a strategy of any country to comply with greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reduction targets, especially Brazil, that is a top GHG emitter. This paper aims to identify these strategic economic sectors for investment to mitigate GHG emissions in Brazil. In order to do so, we estimate emission-demand elasticities of productive sectors, obtained from the Brazil’s Input-Output Matrix (IOM). In consequence, we identify those sectors with greater pollution impacts on the economy and then deserve higher priority for investment as well as mitigation policies. The paper also describes the flows and sources of climate investment and suggests that to ensure efficient outcomes policy makers should consider the role played by each different production sector. The results show the relevance of paying particular attention to the country’s productive structure and the pollution pressure it generates. From this approach, we identified that forest sector is still a key investment destination for mitigation of GHG emissions. Agriculture , transportation , and industrial sectors are also relevant to investment allocation. Confronting the results with literature and with the availability of funds, we ratified that forest and agriculture are strategic sectors for Brazil, and the sectoral approaches, classified as strong multilateralism policy architecture, are fundamental to achieve climate targets.",2020-02-01,10.1007/s11027-019-09873-6,"['Jesus Teixeira, Maria Daniele', 'Nogueira, Jorge Madeira', 'Imbroisi, Denise', 'Melo Faria, Alexandre Magno']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-019-09873-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1007,"Projecting the urban energy demand for Indiana, USA, in 2050 and 2080","Energy use is one of the largest drivers of climate change, but the large share of energy used for space heating and cooling is also driven by climate change. Demand for energy, particularly cooling, is important for long-range infrastructure planning. Urban areas represent a very small proportion of total land, but usually consume the majority of energy. In this work, statistical, top-down approaches are used to model residential and commercial urban energy demand changes in Indiana, a state in the Midwest region of the USA, in 2050 and 2080 under the climate change scenarios of RCP 4.5 and 8.5. By modeling energy demand changes in urban areas in Indiana, we can project the majority of energy demand while placing it in a spatial perspective that is missing from the statewide estimates. Two time periods are used to give an intuitive time stamp and temporal perspective. Results indicate that Indiana’s northernmost cities are expected to show significantly increased residential cooling demand due to climate change by 2080. Indianapolis represents an increasing share of total urban commercial and residential energy use over the next 60 years.

Why such silence? Where are the voices of science educators? In this position statement, I offer a rationale for expanding our views of science education to address sustainable development, empowerment, and social transformation. Science education ought to be a primary vehicle for addressing the current and emerging global challenges facing humanity. All too often, science educators merely focus upon fostering awareness and concern for global challenges. Such an orientation falls short of the education discourse that ought to be oriented toward addressing the goals, aspirations, desires, and needs of youth, who presently number 1.8 billion and represent the largest segment of the global population being underserved. The active engagement of youth in sustainable development efforts is imperative to achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda. Youth are not mere beneficiaries of the 2030 Agenda; they have a critical role in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I offer a rationale for why science educators ought to become active agents in facilitating the engagement of youth in addressing global challenges facing humanity. Youth are demanding action; science educators ought to enable learners and communities to transform and reinvent the world they are inheriting.",2020-01-14,10.1186/s43031-019-0018-5,"['Kyle, William C., Jr.']",Disciplinary and Interdisciplinary Science Education Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s43031-019-0018-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1009,A second-take on the role of science: the case for applying public administration theory to natural resource management,"Background Natural resource management theory has been informed by disciplines such as ecology, agricultural science, economics and engineering; but much less so by the literature of planning and public administration. This paper demonstrates that applying an incremental view to what is traditionally seen as a rational-comprehensive discipline provides insights into resource management theory and practice, including adaptive management. Results We show how current theory and practice in natural resource management are not aligned to the degree that is routinely presumed. In particular, the prevailing focus on optimality creates conflicts, especially during democratic decision-making, whereas adopting a participatory-incremental hybrid approach should provide a superior solution, which is discussed here in the context of Life Cycle Assessment by resource managers. Conclusion Resource management tends to be both incremental and participatory; and whilst decisions are strongly informed by science, on reflection, the process of formulating decisions is rarely rational-comprehensive. We suggest greater retrospective analysis of resource management decisions at a theoretical level. This may result in adoption of a theoretical framework which better supports practice, a reduction in tensions between those trained in the arts and sciences; and more ‘freedom’ in practice, through a softening of the focus on optimality.",2020-01-07,10.1186/s42055-019-0018-5,"['Brock, Philippa M.', 'Tan, Daniel K.

1010,Co-benefits of Climate Change Mitigation and Pollution Reduction in China’s Urban Areas,"This chapter calculates an index of decoupling economic growth from CO_2 and PM_2.5 emissions, respectively, to examine the synergies of low-carbon development and green development in China’s 30 provincial cities and introduce a simultaneous equations model to quantify the interdependence of climate change mitigation and atmospheric pollutants control in both directions. The results for decoupling show that China’s provincial cities have transitioned over time to a stronger decoupling with respect to both CO_2 and PM_2.5 emissions, and synergies of low-carbon development and green development have mostly been observed in cities with a high level of economic development and large population size in the eastern part of China.

1011,Biofuels: Perspective for Sustainable Development and Climate Change Mitigation,"Soaring fuel prices and climate change are two major problems the world is facing now. There has long been argued that the commercial fuel stocks will only remain for some more time now. Since the human population depends vastly on the non-renewable sources of energy for much of its transport, creating alternatives to liquid fuels has become obligatory. Hence, there is global urgency to harness liquid fuels from non-fossil sources. This chapter argues that biofuels are a possible “greener” alternative to fossil fuels. They are globally sustainable and available. Because biomass is green and carbon neutral, it can lead to sustainable development and global environmental conservation. Apparent benefits of biofuels are indicated by the fact that a greater number of countries are willing to implement and plan increase share of biofuels in their energy requirements. In order to do so, substantial production increases are needed quickly to accommodate rising global demand. Technologies must be advanced to obtain biofuels from terrestrial as well as aquatic plants/algae. Policies both, nationally in respective countries as well as internationally, need to incorporate greater role of biofuel as a substitute to fossil-based fuels. We bring in attention an approach to bring production and trade of biofuels under the carbon trade facility called Clean Development Mission. This will not only provide an added option to mitigate climate change but also better enhance global sustainability by encouraging biofuel production especially in developing countries.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-981-15-3761-5_1,"['Singhal, Akshay', 'Prashant']",Biotechnology for Biofuels: A Sustainable Green Energy Solution,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-15-3761-5_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1012,"Ethics and Law of Sustainability – Especially of Freedom, Human Rights, Democracy, and Balancing in a Reinterpreted Perspective","Non-sustainable societies can therefore be explained descriptively, but can sustainability be justified as a normative goal? The factual influence of values on our behaviour is limited. But when we ask what is normatively right, talking about values is the crucial level. Sustainability, in the sense of intertemporally and globally tenable ways of life and production, is a normative requirement. In order to justify this ethically and legally, a new foundation of universal justice is necessary. Common ethical approaches, which are intended to show the possibility of objective normative statements, prove to be not very convincing on closer inspection. The present theory of universal justice explores the limits of normative rationality and demonstrates that there is considerable scope for balancing without rendering normative questions purely subjective. Furthermore, the area of good living proves to be rationally intangible. The variant of universal justice developed here as the basis of ethics and law and thus also the concretisation of sustainability is a heterodox discourse ethics. It is designed as the basis of a revised ethical and right-interpretive conception of liberal democracy with human rights and separation of powers at the national, European and international level. In particular, the argument that there is no alternative and an elenctic argument justify (a) the possibility of reason in questions of about what is supposed to be and (b) human dignity, i.e. the respect for the autonomy of the individual, and impartiality as (the only) universal principles of justice that logically cannot be denied without self-contradiction. This proves right not only in discourse, but also in practice and also vis-à-vis merely hypothetical discourse partners, i.e. vis-à-vis all human beings. These principles provide the basis for a comprehensive universal right to liberty, which is not limited to certain areas of life, to a democracy with separation of powers, and to a duty to guarantee all this legally. This entire approach, centred around the liberal-democratic basic principles of reason, dignity, impartiality and freedom (and democracy with separation of powers), which in their (still unclear) connection appear for the first time with Kant, can be read as crucial modification of classical discourse ethics. In contrast, contextualistic, metaphysical and skeptic (including empiricist, e.g. utilitarian and cost-benefit-analytical) approaches which compete with a liberal-democratic universalism of discourse-ethical character prove to be unconvincing. This also applies to other versions of liberal-democratic theory such as those of Rawls or Sen. In order to determine concrete sustainability contents, an interpretation of the concept of sustainability itself or of topoi such as a legal “state objective for environmental protection” is not very promising, because it remains too vague. Rather, a new ethical and legal interpretation of human rights in the sense of overcoming a primarily economy-oriented understanding of freedom makes sense. This provides an ethically and legally stable basis for sustainability while at the same time overcoming the incompleteness of liberal-democratic philosophies. All statements on justice are statements on the social level. Ethical obligations of the individual that go beyond the obligation to bring about a just – including sustainable – social order are difficult to imagine inter alia due to a lack of concreteness under the auspices of sustainability problems as quantity problems. This is one of the reasons why human rights are always conveyed through public authority, even if their origin lies in the relationship between individuals. In general, human rights prove to be rights to freedom and to the elementary preconditions of freedom. A distinction of negative and positive freedom does not work. The ethical and legal interpretation that human rights only protect selected, supposedly particularly valuable freedom activities, is equally unconvincing. The humandignity principle (understood as the required respect for the autonomy of the individual, i.e. the principle of self-determination) and the impartiality principle understood as the required independence from specific perspectives) are not fundamental rights, nor are they intended to say anything at all about a concrete ethical or legal individual case. Rather, they are the basis for justifying and interpreting freedom and thus also for a sustainability-oriented reinterpretation of freedom, of the rules of balancing, and of democratic institutions. All this and more applies to liberal-democratic nation states, to the EU and also to international institutions and organisations – also based on a further developed figure of general principles of international law. Ethically and legally (also on a transnational level), as normative essence of sustainability, there is a right to the elementary preconditions of freedom. This means conditions such as life, health, subsistence level in the form of food, water, security, climate stability, elementary education, absence of war and civil war, etc. The protection of other freedom-promoting conditions, on the other hand, has no ethical or legal human-rights status, but nevertheless deserves recognition, albeit not the duty of the public authorities to act. This is where sustainability concerns are located if they are not elementary to freedom. – The possible alternative to the existing concept of freedom, which would be an ethics of capabilities or need, is rejected due to a number of logical and legal issues, problems of application, and illiberal tendencies. The freedom outlined in this way, including its elementary preconditions, deserves legal and ethical protection also intertemporally and globally, and thus leads to a human-rights-based theory of sustainability. In particular, arguments for this intertemporal and global extension can be formulated under aspects of potentiality and freedom protection where freedom is endangered. Counterarguments against an intertemporal-global protection of fundamental rights such as the future-individual paradox or the reference to unknown preferences of future generations are ultimately not convincing. The precautionary principle can be classified as a sub-aspect of human rights; it reflects their protection even in uncertain, long-term and multi-causal risk situations. Furthermore, freedom also contains protection by the state, not only defense against the state. These insights are not rendered irrelevant by certain widespread objections to such a multipolar understanding of freedom (e.g. in relation to democracy and the separation of powers). The classical distinctions of action and omission and also deontology versus consequentialism thus latently lose their object. Only in view of all of these steps it is possible to interpret human rights in a manner which includes the protection against climate change, dwindling resources, etc. and thus concrete normative sustainability criteria become conceivable. Environmental-ethical pathocentrism or eco-centrism can make no additional contribution to the normative theory of sustainability issues, since these approaches prove to be untenable at closer inspection. Nevertheless, environmental protection has a comprehensive ethical and legal justification. In general, freedom is limited only by freedom and the preconditions of freedom of other people, not by any form of common good or the like, which should rather be rejected as a concept. Questions of the good life elude regulation, which is why the ethical and legal justification of sustainability measures does not refer to the subsequent possibly greater happiness of those whose freedom is restricted. Discourses on frugality and nudging, for example, are often based on false assumptions in this respect. Main issues of the welfare state can be identified as sustainability phenomena, taking the threat of climate change into account, although the possibility of objectively answering distributional questions is often overestimated. Ethical and legal decisions can only be understood as a balancing situation (between various freedoms, elementary preconditions of freedom, further freedom promoting conditions and everything that can be derived from all of the above). Any sustainability decision is thus marked by normative and factual uncertainties (which is usually overlooked). Concrete problems such as “strong versus weak sustainability” or the relevance of a specific argument can only be meaningfully resolved within this theoretical framework. The ethical and legal theory of sustainability is also developed as a transformed theory of democracy and of balance of powers. The main victims of today’s unsustainability are not voters of today’s parliaments and governments, but future generations and people in other countries. Sustainability is thus in conflict with democracy, to which it – on the other hand – has an affinity because of the necessity of discourses and learning processes (which also rules out any kind of ecodictatorship). Institutional innovations compared to the existence of democracies based on separation of powers are only indicated to a limited extent in the context of sustainability. The most important point is to establish liberal-democratic institutions on an international level in addition to the national sphere. The right balancing rules, which are the very basis for normative sustainability statements, can be obtained through a legal and ethical balancing theory, which goes beyond traditional legal and ethical approaches and sociological risk theory. These balancing rules outline the scope normatively rational statements which are possible to make e.g. on sustainability and which are based on liberal-democratic principles. Rules of procedure and fact-finding rules can also be derived, as can a new human-rights understanding of the precautionary principle in law and ethics. There are also rules for taking new findings in valuations and facts into account. In the interplay of the powers (nationally and transnationally), the violation of balancing rules leads to an obligation to make a new decision in compliance with the previously violated rule – and thus ultimately to an obligation to (significantly) more sustainability. Violated rules in terms of sustainability concern e.g. the factual basis of climate policy to date and the polluter pays principle. The most important rule for the context of sustainability is the prohibition to ruin the basis of balancing as such by depriving its physical foundations. In spite of all remaining leeway, this already carries a human rights obligation similar to the extent of the temperature limit in Article 2 para. 1 PA. A partly similar statement can be made for other resource and sink challenges, but not for all of them. If using further balancing rules such as the polluter pays principle and economic capacity, it is also possible to give some indications as to how the efforts and costs of mitigation and adaptation should be distributed globally. All this is also meant as an alternative to the economic cost-benefit analysis, which ultimately represents an empiricist ethics in disguise. It is not only based on a (hidden) untenable normative basic theory and has unsolvable application problems. It also finds itself in insoluble conflicts with a liberal-democratic legal system that does not allocate rights according to solvency and does not primarily organise votes as plebiscitary snapshots.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-19277-8_3,"['Ekardt, Felix']",Sustainability,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-19277-8_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1013,Alternative Fuels for Sustainable Development,"As the demand for energy increases, reserves of fossil fuels are steadily declining. The growing consumption of energy is responsible for the world’s dependence on non-renewable energy sources, such as petroleum, gas, and coal. The burning of fossil fuels increases greenhouse gases, resulting in increasing global temperatures. To overcome these problems, there is an urgent need for alternative and advanced fuels. Bioethanol, biodiesel, and biogas are the best fuels generated from biomass, and there are also emerging fuels that could minimize the overloading of non-renewable fuels and decrease pollution levels. Bioethanol is a plentiful new source of fuel for the future and has the capacity to conserve petroleum resources. Biodiesel is also clean and is generated from renewable sources. It can be used in diesel engines either directly or as an additive in diesel fuel. It has the capacity to replace petro-diesel fuel and to reduce pollution levels. Apart from biodiesel, hydrogen is also a clean source of energy and has huge potential to minimize the load of imported energy sources. Alternative fuel production and use play major roles in economic growth, biomass waste management, producing a cleaner environment, decreasing gaseous pollutants, and ultimately developing sustainability. This chapter discusses the energy problem, the current status of conventional fuel sources, and the role of alternative fuels in sustainable development.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-981-13-5889-0_16,"['Bhan, Chandra', 'Verma, Lata', 'Singh, Jiwan']",Environmental Concerns and Sustainable Development,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-13-5889-0_16,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1014,Biochar Application for Greenhouse Gases Mitigation,"Agricultural applications significantly increase the atmospheric emissions of non-CO_2 greenhouse gases, nitrogen oxides and methane. Therefore, studies on new strategies to reduce greenhouse gases are become more important. Biochar produced from different organic materials as a by-product of slow pyrolysis and/or rapid pyrolysis, gasification or combustion processes can be used for carbon sequestration, greenhouse gases mitigation, soil improvement, waste management and wastewater treatment. Biochar application is promising technology as a climate change mitigation tool to reduce carbon emissions from soils. The agricultural implementation of biochar may have an important effect on global warming reduction by greenhouse gas emission mitigation and carbon sequestration. Besides, biochar can support the improvement of soil structure and productivity and increase the yields in agriculture. In this study, biochar application and especially the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are reviewed.

1015,Financing Forest Protection with Integrated REDD+ Markets in Brazil,"It is widely recognized that Brazil has achieved a great degree of greenhouse abatement mainly due the 70% reduction in the deforestation rate combining control instruments as the improvement of monitoring system and sanction enforcement on forest management plus restrictions to agricultural expansion in the region. Brazil’s INDC is even more ambitious with a target of 90% reduction. In addition to non-use values attached to biodiversity, forest protection generates important local use from extractive production, greenhouse gas mitigation and climate regulation effects on agriculture, cattle raising, and hydroelectricity production. But the incentive power of the current control measures of forest policies has reached its limit and requires a more complex set of incentives that internalize pricing signals. One way to pursue is to count payments for the performance on the reduction emission of forest deforestation and degradation (REDD+). The chapter, after reviewing estimates of the ancillary benefits from land use mitigation options in Brazil, presents an Integrated REDD+ that catalyzes the transfer of financial resources to the land use sector, while ensuring that non-REDD+ options continue to receive financial resources for the innovation and decarbonization of industrial, transportation, and energy activities.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-30978-7_14,"['Seroa da Motta, Ronaldo', 'Costa, Pedro Moura', 'Cenamo, Mariano', 'Soares, Pedro', 'Viana, Virgílio', 'Salviati, Victor', 'Bernasconi, Paula', 'Thuault, Alice', 'Ribeiro, Plinio']",Ancillary Benefits of Climate Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-30978-7_14,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

As CP practices call for a deep analysis and monitoring of processes, problematic areas quickly become visible, paving the road for improvement and gains. However, there is no universal solution as every company, industry and country has specific obstacles that need to be overcome. As previously stated, good CP practices start in the design phase of any product/process, leading to gains throughout the entire chain when an eco-design is implemented. Even though there many positive examples, still many factors hinder the application of CP policies such as disbelief of economic gains, lack of workforce training, lack of governmental investment, laws and enforcement, lack of foresight by top management and stakeholders, among others. For these reasons, the application of CP practices is scattered and has been avoided.

1017,How Tectonic Shifts in Global Energy Are Affecting Global Governance,"The global energy landscape is undergoing tectonic shifts. Growth in energy demand and the revolution in unconventional oil and gas supply are restructuring world energy flows and geopolitics. At the same time, climate policies push for a decarbonised global energy mix. The resulting decentralisation of energy production and consumption is aided further by the digitalisation of energy systems. Other technological innovations are also driving the process and causing significant changes in, for instance, renewable energy and low-carbon vehicles—but also in oil and gas production. All these shifts in global energy have fundamental implications for not only energy economics but also energy geopolitics and related global governance issues. Hafner and Wochner take a scenario approach to model the strategies of major geopolitical blocs in the age of climate change: humanity might achieve a coordinated global effort for climate change, take only weak action on the climate or simply muddle its way through in dealing with the central threat of this century. In each of those scenarios, the major geopolitical blocs hold differing strategic positions, with the outcomes benefiting some more than others.

1018,Divestment from Coal Sector in Response to Higher Risk Assessment by Insurance Companies: Poland Case Study,"The changes in the approach of insurance companies to risk assessment related to climate change are the subject of the analysis. The following risks were taken into account: material risk resulting directly from extreme weather phenomena, legal and regulatory risk related to international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reputation risk associated with preferences of increasingly aware stakeholders. The policy against coal sector and divestments demonstrated by chosen insurance companies were analyzed. Observations concerned the insurance markets in the years 2015–2018 with particular emphasis on the coal sector in Poland. As a result of the research, it was found that the changes in the understanding and transparency of climate risk reporting affect the functioning of the financial sector in relation to investments in conventional coal mining and energy production. The new global trend is divestment from the coal industry. This may have a major impact on the future functioning of this sector in Poland, where the transition to a low-emission economy is still too slow. This is related to the gradual withdrawal of foreign insurance companies from the Polish coal sector.

1019,Advances in Engineering Strategies for Enhanced Production of Lipid in Rhodosporidium sp. from Lignocellulosics and Other Carbon Sources,"Over the past few years, Rhodosporidium sp. has received a great amount of interest due to its ability to accumulate 50–70% lipid of their total dry cell weight. In addition, Rhodosporidium sp. has also been demonstrated to thrive on multiple carbon sources such as hexoses and pentoses, which made them the potential candidate for lipid production using mixed carbon sources. Despite these advantages, the feasibility of Rhodosporidium sp. as a biofuel producer is still questionable. Many strategies were developed for improving the lipid production in this strain. Genetic engineering also allowed the researchers to increase the tolerance to inhibitors and to enhance the consumption of carbon sources form lignocellulosic biomass. This chapter systematically presents the engineering strategies that have been employed for strain improvement and highlighted the potential of Rhodosporidium as a biotechnological chassis.

1021,Crop Protection for Agricultural Intensification Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Pests, diseases and weeds are major constraints to cropping system intensification in sub-Saharan Africa. Four major intensification systems to achieve sustainable agriculture have been identified: conventional with high input, organic, agroecological and eco-technical ‘sustainable intensive’. Those systems display advanced crop protection. Here we review the performance of those systems in the context of sub-Saharan Africa. The major points are: (1) Unlike economies of Europe and North America following World War 2, and of Asia and Latin America following the Green Revolution, sub-Saharan Africa rural economies were not transformed by conventional intensification involving cultivation of cash crops for export and over-reliance on pesticides. Genetically modified crops were used only to a limited extent at the regional level. (2) Most staple food-based cropping systems are de facto organic due to the unavailability of synthetic inputs. Organic systems are thus developing for some export cash crop sectors, with synthetic pesticides are being substituted by non-chemical pesticides. (3) Agroecological crop protection focuses on biological pest regulations such as the replacement of chemical inputs, thus implying the re-design of cropping systems. (4) For crop protection, the eco-technical pathway, which is based on principles of integrated pest management and ecological intensification, is more flexible and pragmatic than the other systems. In this review we compare the different systems, notably their contribution to six ecosystem services connected with crop protection issues: biomass production, pest and disease regulation, maintenance of water quality, biodiversity conservation, pollination and climate change mitigation.

1022,Modeling,"Managing FEW systems requires modeling tools to understand the merits of different decisions, policies, and investments given potential future constraints and the wider social, environmental, and economic contexts in which these are made. This chapter reviews integrated modeling tools used to support the analysis of FEW systems; especially those used for integrated planning; and the identification and evaluation of trade-offs and synergies. Integrated FEW system models include representations of Coupled Natural-Human Systems (e.g., the energy system, agriculture and land use, water supply and use, the economy, and the climate). Through this integration, these models allow for exploration of FEW system interactions, and the interactions between these systems and other key external forces such as climate change, socioeconomic and technological change, and policy interventions. There is a clear relationship between FEW system modeling and the metrics reflecting interactions. While several modeling frameworks are described in this book, only a small number of models and projects have been actually implemented in practice. Ongoing research and applications of FEW system modeling consist of the development of principles, algorithms, data requirements, and model formulations for understanding and evaluating the potential of implementing FEW system nexus approaches within a systems perspective. Outputs and products of these efforts are quantitative tools that focus on FEW system planning in order to identify primary opportunities and constraints to FEW system development, indicating priorities for more detailed analysis as well as providing a characterization of alternative system configurations that meet integrated FEW objectives.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-29914-9_15,"['Miralles-Wilhelm, Fernando R.']",The Food-Energy-Water Nexus,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-29914-9_15,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

Therefore, effective concepts are needed which avoid further climate-damaging impacts and contribute to an adaptation to impacts that are happening now. A quality management system (QMS) for climate change adaptation, developed for the Tri-City Area Bergisches Städtedreieck, is supposed to serve as a management tool to mainstream climate adaptation into practice. Based on existing programs and approaches in the scope of climate mitigation, the QMS for climate adaptation aims to determine the progress and success of an adaptation process. The assessment of progress is accomplished by applying process indicators. To be able to evaluate the state of the art of the adaptation process, members of public administrations may use the developed questionnaire of the QMS. This progress assessment intends to highlight those areas in which the municipality is already well prepared and those in which there is still need for action. An application of the QMS pursues the goal to integrate the notion of climate change into all sectors of public administration and to promote a climate change adapted urban development in the long run.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-93336-8_56,"['Prenger-Berninghoff, Kathrin', 'Neht, Alice', 'Witte, Andreas']",Handbook of Climate Change Resilience,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-93336-8_56,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1025,Bioclimatic Approach and Appropriate Financial Governance to Promote Sustainable Building Design,"Before being smart, a construction should first be sustainable. If it is true that the notion of sustainable building is closely linked to the matter of environment and multidisciplinary approach, the question of comfort and energy saving remains crucial. The bioclimatic approach constitutes precisely a sustainable construction mode that revolves around the concern of energy and comfort. However, the use of this mode often leads to an additional cost which may be a significant inhibitor of using this sustainable approach. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that despite the implementation of regulations that encourage this construction method, the additional cost constraint cannot be addressed without the establishment of a financial governance dedicated to the sustainable building sector. By analyzing four experienced projects that were inspired by the bioclimatic approach, namely Al Karama, Jacaranda, Al Ouroud and the new city «Lakhyayta», we will explore what were the main sustainable practices used. Then we will discuss the question of additional coast and measures or arrangements that can be made for a financial governance specific to sustainable building.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-37629-1_77,"['Loudyi, Najoua', 'Harrouni, Khalid']",Innovations in Smart Cities Applications Edition 3,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-37629-1_77,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1026,Recent Innovations in Stabilized Earthen Construction,"There is an increasing global attention on earthen construction due to its good attributes of having less carbon footprint. In order to improve its competitiveness with other construction materials like concrete and fired bricks, continuous research activities are undertaken across the globe to produce earth-based building materials having desired engineering properties and durability with the greater insights into the understanding of the factors contributing to the improvement in engineering properties and durability of earthen material as a construction material, the confidence level of handling earth materials in construction sector has increased. To further society’s renewed interest in earthen construction, there is a need to make earthen construction more economical and sustainable. In this direction innovative research findings to use conventional stabilizers in combination in the preparation of earth-based building materials has found to have multiple benefits. Further, to make it eco-friendlier, the focus is to try alternate stabilizers which are cost effective and reduce the dependence on energy intensive cement for stabilization, which contributes for the emission of Green House Gas in its production. In this direction use of eco-friendly stabilizers sourced from organic matter in the form of bio-enzymes and biopolymers are being explored as a possible alternative to conventional stabilizers like cement in enhancing the engineering properties of earth-based building materials for construction applications. This research article presents the recent innovative research concepts in stabilized earth-based building materials and construction. It also presents the benefits of utilizing industrial by-products in lieu of sand or as a substitute to soil in construction activities for preserving the scarce natural resources and sustenance of construction industry.

1027,Understanding Digital Earth,"In the two decades since the debut of the Digital Earth (DE) vision, a concerted international effort has engaged in nurturing the development of a technology framework and harnessing applications to preserve the planet and sustain human societies. Evolutionary threads can be traced to key historic and multidisciplinary foundations, which were presciently articulated and represented at the first International Symposium on Digital Earth hosted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1999. Pioneering groups in government, industry, and academia have cultivated this fertile futuristic conceptual model with technological incubation and exploratory applications. An array of space-age developments in computers, the internet and communications, Earth observation satellites, and spatially oriented applications sparked an innovative discipline. The Beijing Declaration on Digital Earth is recognized for its role in promulgating the series of International Symposia on Digital Earth to promote understanding of the impacts of DE technology and applications on behalf of humankind. Combinations of industrial, academic, and government organizations have rapidly advanced the technological components necessary for implementing the DE vision. Commercial leaders such as Google have accelerated the influence of DE for large segments of society. Challenges remain regarding requisite collaboration on international standards to optimize and accelerate DE implementation scenarios. This chapter provides an overview of the DE initiative and basic framework, the global response to DE, the evolution of DE, its relationship to key global science initiatives, and the response to global challenges.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-981-32-9915-3_1,"['Liu, Zhen', 'Foresman, Tim', 'Genderen, John', 'Wang, Lizhe']",Manual of Digital Earth,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-32-9915-3_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1028,The impact of conservation farming practices on Mediterranean agro-ecosystem services provisioning—a meta-analysis,"In the Mediterranean region, the long-term provision of agro-ecosystem services is threatened by accelerating climate change, unsustainable farming practices, and other pressures. Alternative management practices such as conservation agriculture could be expected to ensure sustainability of ecosystem services from Mediterranean agro-ecosystems. Conservation agriculture is characterized by minimal soil disturbance, permanent soil cover, and diversification of crop species. We analyzed the impacts of several forms of alternative agricultural management practices (conservation tillage, cover cropping, mulching, manual weed management, organic fertilizer use, no-irrigation system) on multiple ecosystem services based on 155 published case studies (1994–2015). The effect size of various management options on four provisioning and four regulating ecosystem services were quantified. Impacts of conservation management options are not uniform. All regulating services were positively affected by the conservation management options except for the system without irrigation. In contrast, the provisioning services were inconsistently influenced by the conservation management options. For crop yield, environmentally sustainable soil management was beneficial, but organic fertilization (effect size = − 0.17), manual weed management (effect size = − 0.35), and no-irrigation system (effect size = − 0.5) led to lower crop yields. The impact on crop biomass was mainly negative but not significant. Water availability was especially important to enhance both provisioning and regulating services. Overall, alternative agriculture management practices led to more positive than negative effects on ecosystem services in the study region. Stimulating the application of conservation management practices is therefore an important policy option for decision-makers given the vulnerability of ecosystem services in the Mediterranean basin.",2019-12-01,10.1007/s10113-018-1447-y,"['Lee, Heera', 'Lautenbach, Sven', 'Nieto, Ana Paula García', 'Bondeau, Alberte', 'Cramer, Wolfgang', 'Geijzendorffer, Ilse R.']",Regional Environmental Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10113-018-1447-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1029,"Agrowaste bioconversion and microbial fortification have prospects for soil health, crop productivity, and eco-enterprising","Purpose Agricultural chemicals either used as nutrient inputs for soil fertility or pesticides are creating physicochemical and biological deterioration of the soils and disturbing the agro-ecosystems worldwide. Alarming concerns towards integrated agroecology demand for renewed interest in low-external input-based farming practices. These practices comprise strengthening of soil biological properties, recycling of inherent soil minerals and reuse of agricultural residual wastes. Methods We described approaches for the bioconversion of agricultural residual wastes into value-added compost. The process involves conversion of residual waste into raw compost followed by its fortification with beneficial decomposer microorganisms to produce quality fortified compost product. Finally, incubation of fortified compost with single or consortia of beneficial microorganisms like N-fixers, P-solubilizers or K-mobilizers and biocontrol agents further enriches compost to produce bioorganic products. Results Bioconversion of agricultural wastes into compost using potential decomposer microorganisms and fortification of decomposed organic matter with beneficial bacterial and fungal species is of immense importance. Additional enrichment of compost with botanicals, humic acid, amino acids, mineral nutrients, phytohormones etc. may also add value to the bioinput products. Conclusion In an integrated way, on-farm production of raw compost using different agricultural residual wastes and its further fortification with bioorganic farm inputs can help farmers produce value-added compost products for direct application in the crop production. Adoption of microbial bioconversion technologies and their field applications may become eco-enterprising for the rural resource-poor farming communities for enhancing their livelihood along with improving farm productivity and soil health.",2019-12-01,10.1007/s40093-019-0243-0,"['Singh, Dhananjaya P.', 'Prabha, Ratna', 'Renu, Shukla', 'Sahu, Pramod Kumar', 'Singh, Vivek']",International Journal of Recycling of Organic Waste in Agriculture,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40093-019-0243-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1030,Emerging risk governance for stratospheric aerosol injection as a climate management technology,"Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) as a solar radiation management (SRM) technology may provide a cost-effective means of avoiding some of the worst impacts of climate change, being perhaps orders of magnitude less expensive than greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. At the same time, SAI technologies have deeply uncertain economic and environmental impacts and complex ethical, legal, political, and international relations ramifications. Robust governance strategies are needed to manage the many potential benefits, risks, and uncertainties related to SAI. This perspective reviews the International Risk Governance Council (IRGC)’s guidelines for emerging risk governance (ERG) as an approach for responsible consideration of SAI, given the IRGC’s experience in governing other more conventional risks. We examine how the five steps of the IRGC’s ERG guidelines would address the complex, uncertain, and ambiguous risks presented by SAI. Diverse risks are identified in Step 1, scenarios to amplify or dissipate the risks are identified in Step 2, and applicable risk management options identified in Step 3. Steps 4 and 5 involve implementation and review by risk managers within an established organization. For full adoption and promulgation of the IRGC’s ERG guidelines, an international consortium or governing body (or set of bodies) should be tasked with governance and oversight. This Perspective provides a first step at reviewing the risk governance tasks that such a body would undertake and contributes to the growing literature on best practices for SRM governance.",2019-12-01,10.1007/s10669-019-09730-6,"['Grieger, Khara D.', 'Felgenhauer, Tyler', 'Renn, Ortwin', 'Wiener, Jonathan', 'Borsuk, Mark']",Environment Systems and Decisions,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10669-019-09730-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1031,A Descriptive Analysis of the Effects of Weather Disasters on Community Resilience,"Weather and climate disasters are increasing threats to the survival of human communities across the globe. The aim of this descriptive analysis was to analyze the ways by which the citizens of Puerto Rico responded to Hurricane María’s landfall. For this purpose, we used the elaborated account of the metacontingency (Houmanfar, Rodrigues, & Ward, 2010 , “Emergence & Metacontingency: Points of Contact and Departure,” Behavior and Social Issues , 19 , 78–103) to analyze the community’s process of recovery and adaptation. At the group level, we identified the cultural milieu (i.e., contextual variables), as well as the emerging macrocontingencies and metacontingencies in Puerto Rico’s recovery process. The results of this analysis have theoretical and applied implications. At the theoretical level, the 5-term metacontingency effectively orients scientific work toward the identification of the psychological and sociological factors involved in the human response to natural disasters. At the applied level, identifying these factors can potentially inform future weather disaster–related preventive recovery and adaptive measures and procedures.",2019-11-01,10.1007/s42822-019-00015-w,"['Ardila Sánchez, José G.', 'Houmanfar, Ramona A.', 'Alavosius, Mark P.']",Behavior and Social Issues,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s42822-019-00015-w,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

Data on output production of bioenergy in megawatt were obtained from the International Renewable Energy Agency, and (MW). We implemented the linear regression method redundant to predict the future production of bioenergy data and attained good accuracy. The aforementioned method is applicable to developing countries and can be used to predict bioenergy production and formulate new policies that are adapted to an increasing population in a particular country.

Hence, we interact non-renewable electricity consumption with capital investment to determine the mediating role of capital investment in the nexus between electricity consumption and carbon emission in BRICS. This study applies the fully modified and the dynamic ordinary least squares techniques to conduct this scientific enquiry, and the result suggests that electricity consumption and growth positively and significantly enhance the level of emissions, while capital investment significantly reduces the level of emissions in BRICS. Also, capital investment interacts with non-renewable electricity consumption to improve environmental quality in both approaches employed, thereby reversing the earlier increase in emissions caused by electricity consumption. In addition, we confirm the proposition of the environmental Kuznets curve in BRICS and conclude that capital investment is an important channel for improving environmental quality.",2019-08-15,10.1007/s10668-018-0110-6,"['Mesagan, Ekundayo P.', 'Isola, Wakeel A.', 'Ajide, Kazeem B.']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-018-0110-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

Spikelet removal and low temperature stress significantly reduced total plant N uptake, thereby increasing soil NO_3^–-N content, and increased root biomass. Our findings indicated that photosynthate allocation affects the soil N_2O emissions from wheat fields through altering plant N uptake and root growth, and suggest that promoting photosynthate allocation to grain may not only benefit higher wheat yield but also mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.",2019-08-01,10.1007/s00374-019-01377-4,"['Deng, Aixing', 'Zhang, Xin', 'Zhang, Xingyue', 'Qian, Haoyu', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Chen, Changli', 'Jiang, Yu', 'Zheng, Chengyan', 'Zhang, Weijian']",Biology and Fertility of Soils,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00374-019-01377-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1036,Mid-century emission pathways in Japan associated with the global 2 °C goal: national and global models’ assessments based on carbon budgets,"This study assesses Japan’s mid-century low-emission pathways using both national and global integrated assessment models in the common mitigation scenario framework, based on the carbon budgets corresponding to the global 2 °C goal. We examine high and low budgets, equal to global cumulative 1600 and 1000 Gt-CO_2 (2011–2100) for global models, and 36 and 31 Gt-CO_2 (2011–2050) in Japan for national models, based on the cost-effectiveness allocation performed by the global models. The impacts of near-term policy assumption, including the implementation and enhancement of the 2030 target of the nationally determined contribution (NDC), are also considered. Our estimates show that the low budget scenarios require a 75% reduction of CO_2 emissions by 2050 below the 2010 level, which is nearly the same as Japan’s governmental 2050 goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80%. With regard to near-term actions, Japan’s 2030 target included in the NDC is on track to meet the high budget scenario, whereas it is falling short for the low budget scenario, which would require emission reductions immediately after 2020. Whereas models differ in the type of energy source on which they foresee Japan basing its decarbonization process (e.g., nuclear- or variable renewable energy-dependent), the large-scale deployment of low-carbon energy (nuclear, renewable, and carbon capture and storage) is shared across most models in both the high and low budget scenarios. By 2050, low-carbon energy represents 44–54% of primary energy and 86–97% of electricity supply in the high and low budget scenarios, respectively.",2019-07-20,10.1007/s10584-019-02490-x,"['Oshiro, Ken', 'Gi, Keii', 'Fujimori, Shinichiro', 'Soest, Heleen L.', 'Bertram, Christoph', 'Després, Jacques', 'Masui, Toshihiko', 'Rochedo, Pedro', 'Roelfsema, Mark', 'Vrontisi, Zoi']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-019-02490-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1037,Influence of Binders on Combustion Properties of Biomass Briquettes: A Recent Review,"Briquettes are widely used as a renewable energy material for solving the problem of dependency and over-consumption of wood fuel as a source of energy for human use. However, their performance depends on the types and nature of binders used during the preparation and densification process. Most of the performance-related problems such as low yield and energy content can be significantly improved with the use of binders in right proportions. This review discusses the state-of-the-art of fuel briquettes and the influence of binder’s properties on the combustion characteristics, energy content, mechanical durability, and density of fuel briquettes. The compatibility between the binders and the fuel briquettes to obtain a better yield is also discussed with the resulting mechanical and combustion properties. The mechanical durability of fuel briquettes can be improved by reducing the content of lignin, fat, and other extractives in the binder, as well as improving the binder’s variables such as the particle size, texture, and quantity. By using binders mixed with phosphorus-based additives such as Ca(H_2PO_4)_2 and NH_4H_2PO_4, the combustion rate of fuel briquettes can be enhanced and the pollutant emissions during the combustion process can be reduced to the minimum. In addition, the higher the binders’ compacting pressure and processing temperature, the higher the density and energy content per unit volume of fuel briquettes.",2019-06-15,10.1007/s12155-019-09973-w,"['Olugbade, Temitope', 'Ojo, Oluwole', 'Mohammed, Tiamiyu']",BioEnergy Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12155-019-09973-w,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1038,Study on Carbon Sequestration Capacity of Typical Crops in Northern China,"The carbon sequestration potential of different crops in their mature period in Northern China was analyzed in order to promote the selection of green species. Carbon dioxide infrared gas detection, three-dimensional fluorescence, fixed carbon enzyme activity analysis and other methods were used to test the carbon sequestration capacity of nine representative mature crops in the Beijing area. Results show that the carbon sequestration capacity of the nine crops was: corn > sorghum > wheat > tomato > cucumber > cabbage > celery > eggplant > pepper. Among them, the carbon sequestration capacity of corn and sorghum which are C_4 crops was stronger than that of other crops. Meanwhile, the three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of corn were closer to sorghum, and there were significant differences in the characteristics of the three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of C_3 crops. Based on the analysis of the activity of the fixed carbon enzyme—Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase (PEP) carboxylase and Ribulose-1, 5-Bisphosphate (RuBP) Carboxylase of these plants show that the carbon sequestration capacity of C_4 crops was much larger than C_3 crops because of its higher PEP carboxylase activity. The carbon sequestration capacity of C_3 crops was positively correlated with the activity of RuBP carboxylase in addition to cabbage. Therefore, the carbon sequestration capacity of crops can be measured by using the portable carbon dioxide infrared analyzer.",2019-06-01,10.1007/s12374-018-0401-3,"['Li, Tianxin', 'Zhang, Fang', 'Jiao, Yuanyuan', 'Zhang, Minjie', 'Chang, Yanhong', 'Matomela, Nametso']",Journal of Plant Biology,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12374-018-0401-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1039,"GHG mitigation in Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector in Thailand","Background The Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector is responsible for almost a quarter of the global Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The emissions associated with AFOLU activities are projected to increase in the future. The agriculture sector in Thailand accounted for 21.9% of the country’s net GHG emissions in 2013. This study aims to estimate the GHG emissions in the AFOLU sector and mitigation potential at various carbon prices during 2015–2050. This study uses an AFOLU bottom-up (AFOLUB) model to estimate GHG emissions in a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, and then identifies no-regret options, i.e. countermeasures that are cost-effective without any additional costs. In addition, the study also identifies countermeasure options and mitigation potential at various carbon prices. Results Results show that emissions from the agriculture sector in the BAU will increase from 45.3 MtCO_2eq in 2015 to 63.6 MtCO_2eq in 2050, whereas net emission from the AFOLU will be 8.3 MtCO_2eq in 2015 and 24.6 MtCO_2eq in 2050. No-regret options would reduce emissions by 6.1 and 6.8 MtCO_2eq in 2030 and 2050, respectively. The carbon price above $10 per tCO_2eq will not be effective to achieve significant additional mitigation/sequestration. Conclusions In 2050, no-regret options could reduce total AFOLU emissions by 27.5%. Increasing carbon price above $10/tCO_2eq does not increase the mitigation potential significantly. Net sequestration (i.e., higher carbon sequestration than GHG emissions) in AFOLU sector would be possible with the carbon price. In 2050, net sequestration would be 1.2 MtCO_2eq at carbon price of $5 per tCO_2eq, 21.4 at $10 per tCO_2eq and 26.8MtCO_2eq at $500 per tCO_2eq.",2019-04-23,10.1186/s13021-019-0119-7,"['Pradhan, Bijay Bahadur', 'Chaichaloempreecha, Achiraya', 'Limmeechokchai, Bundit']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13021-019-0119-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1040,"Projection of Heat Injury to Single-Cropping Rice in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River, China under Future Global Warming Scenarios","Based on simulation results from the 16 CMIP5 model runs under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) in combination with the recent five years of growth-stage data from agrometeorological observation stations in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, changes in heat injury and spatial distribution patterns of single-cropping rice in China during the early (2016–35), middle (2046–65), and late (2080–99) 21st century were projected by using quantitative estimations. Relative to the reference period (1986–2005), the occurrence probabilities of heat injury to single-cropping rice under different RCP scenarios increased significantly, showing a trend of mild > moderate > severe. The occurrence probabilities increased with time and predicted emissions, especially the average and maximum occurrence probabilities, which were ~48% and ~80%, respectively, in the late 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario. The spatial patterns of the occurrence probabilities at each level of heat injury to single-cropping rice did not change, remaining high in the middle planting region and low in the east. The high-value areas were mainly in central Anhui and southeastern Hubei provinces, and the areas extended to the northwest and northeast of the cultivation area over time. Under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, the total area of heat injury to single-cropping rice showed a significant linear increasing trend of 7.4 × 10^3, 19.9 × 10^3, and 35.3 × 10^3 ha yr^−1, respectively, from 2016 to 2099, and the areas of heat injury were greatest in the late 21 st century, accounting for ~25%, ~40%, and ~59% of the cultivation area.",2019-04-01,10.1007/s13351-019-8105-2,"['Lyu, Xiaomin', 'Zhou, Guangsheng', 'Zhou, Mengzi', 'Zhou, Li', 'Ji, Yuhe']",Journal of Meteorological Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13351-019-8105-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1041,Greenhouse gas emissions and cost assessments of municipal solid waste treatment and final disposal in Maputo City,"The goal in this study is to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the costs of municipal solid waste treatment and final disposal alternatives, in Maputo City, capital of Mozambique. Three scenarios were considered: first, the current practice of open dumping; second, the sole usage of sanitary landfilling; and third, comprising material recovery through recycling and biological treatment by composting or anaerobic digestion, and the usage of sanitary landfilling. The highest GHG emissions were observed in the second scenario with a released amount of 260,621 t of CO_2-eq/year, followed by the current scenario with 201,112 t of CO_2-eq/year. Both variants of the third scenario showed negative net emissions of −296,008 t of CO_2-eq/year and −223,925 t of CO_2-eq/year, due to the combination of GHG avoiding alternatives such as composting and biogas production as well as recycling. The cost assessment pointed towards the second scenario being the highest cost-saving scenario, requiring less than US$ 1 million/year and the current scenario as the most cost-intensive scenario, requiring around US$ 27 million/year—with a contribution from the cost of inaction of US$ 24 million/year. In addition, sensitivity analysis was performed by changing the waste compositing in relation to different income levels, which have verified the consistency of results.

1042,To be or not to be for humankind - organic diets revisited for a sustainable development,"Worldwide, traditional diets are being replaced by diets with high proportions of ultra-processed industrial foods, meat products and refined sugars, fats and oils. By contrast, the (slowly) growing consumption of unrefined organic food products and the more and more popular organic-type of diets are associated with lower consumption of these foods. In this comment, we argue that the growth of the organic food chain is already now contributing to the goal of improving public health in global terms as well as to the goal of reducing the environmental impact of agricultural production and food processing. Thus, consumption of organic food contributes to saving lives and enabling future human existence. As such, the organic food system deserves increased attention and stimulation by scientists and public agencies.",2019-01-16,10.1186/s42055-019-0008-7,"['Simões-Wüst, Ana Paula', 'Dagnelie, Pieter C.']",Sustainable Earth,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s42055-019-0008-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1043,"Structure and above ground biomass along an elevation small-scale gradient: case study in an Evergreen Andean Amazon forest, Ecuador","The purpose of this study was to examine how tree diversity, richness, and structural characteristics as well as above-ground biomass varies along a small-scale elevation gradient from 601 to 1000 m above sea level (m.a.s.l.) in an Evergreen Andean Amazon forest and their implications in terms of carbon storage. Trees with diameter at breast height greater than 10 cm were surveyed in 20 permanent 0.1 ha plots, five at each elevation site. We determined species richness, density, basal area, aerial biomass and calculated a biomass importance value (BIV). The 1378 trees surveyed were mainly contained in the families Moraceae (17 species) Fabaceae (16) and Meliaceae (10). Species richness significantly increased ( P  < 0.007) along the small-scale elevation gradient and was greatest in the range of 901–1000 m.a.s.l. Aerial biomass varied between 246.8 and 320.9 Mega grams per hectare (Mg ha^−1) and did not differ along the gradient ( P  > 0.579). At the highest tree density, the highest BIV of Iriartea deltoidea was found at 601–900 m.a.s.l. The disproportionate contribution of a few species, some being the least abundant but with high AGB in our surveys (e.g., Sterculia sp., Nectandra sp., Ficus sp., and Inga sp.) to carbon stocks is important to consider in furture research on carbon sequestration.

1044,GHG Emissions and Mitigation in Romanian Vineyards,"In viticulture, the water requirement is low and organic fertilizers such as manure or organic matter from cover crops or compost made from pomace and lees are generally applied. Therefore, some specialists are of the opinion that viticulture is less polluting than other farm sectors. Nevertheless, measures for mitigating GHG emissions from vineyards and associated wine industries need to be adopted to preserve the quality of grapevine by-products. In viticulture, GHG emission mitigation can be achieved through appropriate methods of tillage, fertilization, harvesting, irrigation, vineyard maintenance, transport or wine marketing, etc. Besides CO_2, nitrous oxide (N_2O) and methane (CH_4) are produced from fertilizers and waste/wastewater management, respectively. As main GHG in vineyards, N_2O can have the same harmful impact as CO_2. Carbon is found in grape leaves, shoots, and even fruit pulp, roots, canes, trunk or soil organic matter. C sequestration in soil by using less tillage and tractor passing is one of the most efficient methods to reduce GHG in vineyards. However, many years are needed for detecting the resulting SOC changes. In the last decades, among other methods, cover crops have been used successfully for GHG mitigation and increasing soil fertility in vineyards. There is still limited information on practical methods in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in viticulture. Therefore, this paper serves as an information base for researchers and industries working in the viti- and vinicultural sectors by providing knowledge concerning GHG dynamics under standard management approaches and principles. This helps ensure businesses are equipped with new information useful to build an efficient strategy to handle and mitigate GHG emissions.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-981-13-3272-2_4,"['Nistor, Eleonora', 'Dobrei, Alina Georgeta', 'Dobrei, Alin', 'Shurpali, Narasinha']",Greenhouse Gas Emissions,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-13-3272-2_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1045,Energy Performance and Environmental Impact of an Earth-Air Heat Exchanger for Heating and Cooling a Poultry House,"The poultry industry in Morocco is an important sector that contributes to the growth of national economy and food security, but this sector faces many problems, one of those problems is the climatic conditions, heat stress wave in summer and cold wave in winter that causes mortality and drops in performance (weight drop). Another problem is the relatively high consumption of conventional energy and corresponding environmental impact of the released greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, a proposed system for heating and cooling a poultry house is modeled and simulated for the weather conditions of Tangier city-Morocco. The system consists of an earth-air heat exchanger, a mixing box, and an air-air heat recovery, which are combined to control the temperature inside the poultry house efficiently. The results showed that the proposed system has the potential to save between 34.7% and 96% of the energy demand in the heating mode and in the cooling mode respectively.

1046,Livestock Technologies and Grazing Land Management Options for Climate Change Adaption and Mitigation as a Contribution for Food Security in Ethiopia: A Brief Overview,"African countries, like Ethiopia, are particularly vulnerable to climate change because their economies largely depend on climate-sensitive agricultural production. Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) of Ethiopia recognized climate change as a huge threat and focusing on mitigation issues. The GTP stipulates the country’s ambition to build a climate resilient green economy by 2030. This paper looks at the potential of livestock technologies and grazing land management for mitigation and adaption to a changing climate. Research findings in Ethiopia showed that livestock technologies and management of grazing lands such as improving the quality of forage, feeding highly digestible forages, processing and preservation of feeds, use of controlled grazing instead of continuous grazing and inclusion of legumes in forage mixes, have a great response to climate change. The choices for application of the technologies and potential mitigation strategies primarily depend on the adoption and cost associated with it. Grazing land management not only mitigates climate change but also reduces soil erosion, increases carbon sequestration and contributes to the resilience of crop-livestock farming systems in Ethiopia. In conclusion, management of grazing lands and implementation of livestock technologies have good implications in mitigating climate change on top of income generation and thereby improving the livelihood of farmers in Ethiopia.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-75004-0_22,"['Mekuriaw, Shigdaf', 'Mengistu, Alemayehu', 'Tegegne, Firew']",Climate Change-Resilient Agriculture and Agroforestry,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-75004-0_22,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1049,Greenhouse Gas Storage and Sequestration Function,"Soil carbon storage and sequestration provides an ecosystem service (ES) through regulation of atmospheric carbon concentration, and associated climate conditions. Landscape planning to enhance this function can be most efficient through spatial assessment, followed by targeting of mitigation efforts to locations where soil carbon (C) stores are high, currently degrading, or there is good potential for sequestration. Direct measurement of C storage in the landscape is complicated by spatial variation in C storage in soil and biomass, hence in order to evaluate GHG storage and sequestration, calculations can be made based on available data for key factors influencing the offering of this ES. Complex process based models are available for prediction, however landscape planning approaches tend to favour simpler approaches utilising inventory figures and emission factors associated with soil type and vegetation. Inventory figures may include significant uncertainty, and represent average values for the relevant land use and soil, however there is an assumption that errors will balance out at larger regional, and certainly at national scale. If soil data on finer scale is available as well, such as in the case of well-defined wetlands, the certainty of results seems to be good enough for deducing measures. This chapter includes a case study on the application of a simple landscape scale model for assessment of potential placement of agri-environmental measures to enhance or protect soil C storage and sequestration in the landscape, as well as description of other models which may be preferred under different application requirements.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-94-024-1681-7_14,"['Thomas, Amy', 'Schulp, Catharina']",Landscape Planning with Ecosystem Services,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-024-1681-7_14,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

The literature related to climate-economy modelling is already vast: apart from a very large number of models and an even larger number of applications, there already exist many good surveys comparing—inter alia—modelling frameworks, model assumptions and model results. The objective of this chapter is to provide a simple overview and organising scheme of this modelling world by delving into the characteristics of more than 60 individual IAMs towards describing the main ways in which certain classes or groups of climate-economy models differ from one another. In contrast to other more detailed or narrowly focused “overviews” and literature reviews, this analysis takes less for granted and aims at providing an initial understanding of generic model structures.

Based on historical experiences and Utopian ideals, concepts regarding development are codified in the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The quest of assuring human needs entails elimination of hunger and poverty, and guaranteeing good health services and well-being, along with quality education and gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable clean energy, decent work and economic growth, with industry, innovation and infrastructure, and reducing inequalities, as well as creation of sustainable cities and communities. Along with this is the issue of responsible consumption and production, with action taken on climate change, policies and use of water and land environments. Central to this is peace, justice and strong institutions, with durable partnerships to implement sustainability. Basically, it can be argued that any action that does not alleviate poverty in some way cannot be called development but defining poverty has to be addressed in specific contexts. Conflicts remain the biggest threat to development and hence a human rights approach is imperative. Key development ideas must be linked to wider conceptual frameworks of globalisation and glocalization, and democratisation processes.

Here agriculture mitigation potentials are quantified, in the context of the 1.5 °C target, and decomposed by emission source, region and mitigation mechanism. Agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions represent around 10–12% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions and have a key role to play in achieving a 1.5 °C (above pre-industrial) climate stabilization target. Using a multi-model assessment approach, we quantify the potential contribution of agriculture to the 1.5 °C target and decompose the mitigation potential by emission source, region and mitigation mechanism. The results show that the livestock sector will be vital to achieve emission reductions consistent with the 1.5 °C target mainly through emission-reducing technologies or structural changes. Agriculture may contribute emission reductions of 0.8–1.4 Gt of CO_2-equivalent (CO_2e) yr^−1 at just US$20 per tCO_2e in 2050. Combined with dietary changes, emission reductions can be increased to 1.7–1.8 GtCO_2e yr^−1.

However, studies on the impact of UDP under AWD irrigation on nitrous oxide (N_2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions are limited. In this study, the effects of UDP with AWD irrigation on these emissions, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and rice yields are investigated, compared to conventional broadcast application. N_2O and NO emissions from three fertilizer treatments – no nitrogen, UDP, and broadcast application of prilled urea (PU) – were measured. Measurements were taken using an automated gas sampling and analysis system continuously for two consecutive Boro (dry) rice seasons. N_2O emission peaks were observed after broadcast application of PU but not after UDP. In contrast, large spikes in N_2O emission were observed after UDP, compared to broadcast application, during dry periods. Despite differences in emission peaks, seasonal cumulative N_2O emissions from UDP and broadcast treatments were similar. However, NO emissions were minimal and unaffected by UDP or AWD. UDP increased rice yields by 28% and N recovery efficiency by 167%, compared to broadcast urea.

We investigated the effect of five N fertilisation strategies on nitrous oxide (N_2O) emissions and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of rainfed wheat grown on a clay soil in a temperate, semi-arid environment of south eastern Australia during 2013 and 2014. Treatments included urea application (50 kg N/ha) at sowing with and without nitrification inhibitor (3,4–dimethylpyrazole phosphate) and surface broadcasting of urea with and without urease inhibitor (n-butyl thiophosphoric triamide) at the end of tillering plus an unfertilised control. Daily N_2O emissions were low and responsive to in-season rainfall and fertiliser addition at sowing. Cumulative emissions from sowing until harvest were highest where N was applied at sowing in 2013; 160 g N_2O-N/ha, while the 0 N control emitted 28 g N_2O-N/ha (over 201 days). Emissions during 2014 were 77% lower than 2013 due to dry seasonal conditions; cumulative emissions were 49 g N_2O-N/ha where N was applied at sowing, with background emissions of around 0 g N_2O-N/ha (over 177 days). Inhibitors showed limited scope for reducing N_2O emissions in this environment, however deferring N application until the end of tillering reduced N_2O emissions. Grain yield responses to fertiliser were significant; increasing grain yield by 11–31% and NUE was generally high (recovery efficiency > 68%). However, deferring N application until the end of tillering in 2014 reduced yield (− 19%) and recovery of applied N (− 74%).",2018-11-01,10.1007/s10705-018-9941-7,"['Wallace, Ashley J.', 'Armstrong, Roger D.', 'Harris, Robert H.', 'Belyaeva, Oxana N.', 'Grace, Peter R.', 'Partington, Debra L.', 'Scheer, Clemens']",Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10705-018-9941-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1064,The science of food security,"We need to feed an estimated population in excess of 9 billion by 2050 with diminishing natural resources, whilst ensuring the health of people and the planet. Herein we connect the future global food demand to the role of agricultural and food science in producing and stabilising foods to meet the global food demand. We highlight the challenges to food and agriculture systems in the face of climate change and global megatrends that are shaping the future world. We discuss the opportunities to reduce food loss and waste, and recover produce that is currently wasted to make this the new raw ingredient supply for the food industry. Our systems-based perspective links food security to agricultural productivity, food safety, health and nutrition, processing and supply chain efficiency in the face of global and industry megatrends. We call for a collaborative, transdisciplinary approach to the science of food security, with a focus on enabling technologies within a context of social, market and global trends to achieve food and nutritional security.",2018-08-06,10.1038/s41538-018-0021-9,"['Cole, Martin Barry', 'Augustin, Mary Ann', 'Robertson, Michael John', 'Manners, John Michael']",npj Science of Food,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-018-0021-9.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1065,Sugar-energy sector vulnerability under CMIP5 projections in the Brazilian central-southern macro-region,"The Brazilian sugar-energy sector (SES) is facing an increasing challenge due to the worldwide expansion of biofuel consumption as a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making yield improvement and land and water availability key factors in addressing this situation. Consequently, our main aim here is to identify SES vulnerability under climate change conditions, based on the methodology used by the Agricultural Zoning of Climatic Risks (ZARC) program. We assessed changes of the sugarcane ZARC in light of the current and near-future climatic conditions given by eight general circulation models (GCM) of the 5th IPCC report and under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. We identified a conversion of the current climatic risk levels in the Brazilian central-southern macro-region for sugarcane in future climate change scenarios, but the spatial distribution of these changes is heterogeneous. The current expansion areas located mainly in southern Goiás and northwest of São Paulo are marked by an increase in areas of low water availability in the future, while the traditional production areas, east of São Paulo, do not present this same vulnerability. Sugarcane cultivation in the south of Goiás is already occurring based on a complementary irrigation (of about 50 mm per month from April to September) to reach a yield similar to traditional areas located in São Paulo state. The development of drought-resistant cultivars based on genetic engineering and the efficiency of the irrigation systems used on a large spatial scale and also in the long term are two key points of concern in the Brazilian context of greenhouse gas emission mitigation. The challenges for the traditional production regions are related to the production system’s ability to regulate the capacity and idleness of sugarcane mills aiming to avoid current and future competition by same raw material.",2018-08-01,10.1007/s10584-018-2249-4,"['Zullo, Jurandir, Jr', 'Pereira, Vânia Rosa', 'Koga-Vicente, Andrea']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-018-2249-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1066,Impact of climate-smart agriculture adoption on the food security of coastal farmers in Bangladesh,"Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is a suggested pathway to the improvement of food security in a changing climate. The Department of Agricultural Extension under the Bangladesh Ministry of Agriculture has been promoting CSA with farmers through climate field schools since 2010. This study investigated the impact of adoption of CSA practices on the household food security of coastal farmers in southern Bangladesh. Factors determining household food security were also explored. Data were collected from 118 randomly selected farmers of Kalapara sub-district in Patuakhali, Bangladesh. We identified 17 CSA practices that were adopted by the farmers in the study area. Those practices were saline-tolerant crop varieties, flood-tolerant crop varieties, drought-resistant crop varieties, early maturing rice, vegetables in a floating bed, ‘sorjan’ method of farming, pond-side vegetable cultivation, the cultivation of watermelon, sunflower or plum, relay cropping, urea deep placement, organic fertilizer, mulching, use of pheromone trap, rain water harvesting and seed storage in plastic bags or glass bottles. The farmers adopted on average seven out of these CSA practices. Among the sampled households, 32% were assessed as food secure, 51% were mildly to moderately food insecure and 17% were severely food insecure. Adoption of CSA practices was positively associated with household food security in terms of per capita annual food expenditure ( β = 1.48 Euro, p  = 0.015). Households with a better educational level, farming as a major occupation, a larger pond size, greater number of cattle, higher household income, smaller family size and less difficulty with access to markets were likely to be more food secure. Increasing the adoption of CSA was important to enhance food security but not a sufficient condition since other characteristics of the farmers (personal education, pond size, cattle ownership and market difficulty) had large effects on food security. Nevertheless, increased adoption of saline-tolerant and flood-tolerant crop varieties, pond-side vegetable cultivation and rainwater harvesting for irrigation could further improve the food security of coastal farmers in southern Bangladesh.",2018-08-01,10.1007/s12571-018-0824-1,"['Hasan, Md Kamrul', 'Desiere, Sam', 'D’Haese, Marijke', 'Kumar, Lalit']",Food Security,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12571-018-0824-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1067,Rural electrification in sub-Saharan Africa with innovative energy policy and new financing models,"This paper discusses how the 630 million sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) people can be electrified with new government policy, new renewables, and innovative business models. These initiatives are translating the ambitious goals of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) on energy and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties 2015 Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement’s central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise in this century well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 °C. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness to electrify the 630 million people within the Paris Agreement. Economic status and willingness to pay for electricity services by the poor are briefly analyzed for four new business models. Cost-effectiveness analyses on technologies are undertaken. The results show that a private investment-based financial model is the most effective and environmentally friendly in rural electrification for the poorest households in SSA. The new policy, new renewable energy technologies, and financing models are shaping contemporary climate strategies that facilitate investment in clean energy, spur community economy, enhance national energy security, and improve global environment.",2018-08-01,10.1007/s11027-017-9766-8,"['Yang, Fan', 'Yang, Ming']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-017-9766-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1068,"Decoupling emissions of greenhouse gas, urbanization, energy and income: analysis from the economy of China","The adoption and ratification of relevant policies, particularly the household enrolment system metamorphosis in China, led to rising urbanization growth. As the leading developing economy, China has experienced a drastic and rapid increase in the rate of urbanization, energy use, economic growth and greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution for the past 30 years. The knowledge of the dynamic interrelationships among these trends has a plethora of implications ranging from demographic, energy, and environmental and sustainable development policies. This study analyzes the role of urbanization in decoupling GHG emissions, energy, and income in China while considering the critical contribution of energy use. As a contribution to the extant body of literature, the present research introduces a new phenomenon called “the environmental urbanization Kuznets curve” (EUKC), which shows that at the early stage of urbanization, the environment degrades however, after a threshold point the technique effects surface and environmental degradation reduces with rise in urbanization. Applying the autoregressive distributed lag model and the vector error correction model, the paper finds the presence of inverted U-shaped curve between urbanization and GHG emission of CO_2, while the same hypothesis cannot be found between income and GHG emission of CO_2. Energy use in all the models contributes to GHG emission of CO_2. In decoupling greenhouse gas emissions, urbanization, energy, and income, articulated and well-implemented energy and urbanization policies should be considered.",2018-07-01,10.1007/s11356-018-2088-x,"['Wang, Tianqiong', 'Riti, Joshua Sunday', 'Shu, Yang']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-018-2088-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1069,Nitrous oxide mitigation potential of reduced tillage and N input in durum wheat in the Mediterranean,"In Italy, managed soils account for about 50% of annual national emissions of nitrous oxide (N_2O), thus the effect of agricultural practices on N_2O emissions must be studied in order to develop mitigation strategies. Soil N_2O emissions were measured in two field campaigns (2013–2014 and 2014–2015) on durum wheat in a Mediterranean environment to test the mitigation potential of reduced tillage and nitrogen (N) fertilization rate. N_2O emissions were measured with a fully-transportable instrument developed during the project LIFE + IPNOA “Improved flux Prototypes for N_2O emission reduction from Agriculture” and equipped with an infrared laser detector. Reducing tillage from ploughing to minimum tillage had no effect on average daily N_2O flux, while decreasing the N rate from 170 to 110 kg N ha^−1 reduced the average daily N_2O flux, without negatively affecting the grain yield. Furthermore, N_2O daily flux were positively correlated with soil water filled pore space, NO_3-N, and NH_4-N concentrations, and they were largely variable between the two field campaigns as a result of different environmental and management conditions (i.e.: rainfall, different amount of crop residues incorporated in soil). Overall, the innovative fully-transportable instrument performed well in the field and allowed us to conclude that decreasing the N fertilizer rate was a valuable option to mitigate N_2O emissions without negative effects on wheat productivity.",2018-07-01,10.1007/s10705-018-9922-x,"['Volpi, Iride', 'Laville, Patricia', 'Bonari, Enrico', 'Nassi o Di Nasso, Nicoletta', 'Bosco, Simona']",Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10705-018-9922-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1070,Future Trends and Mitigation Options for Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in a Developing Country of the Middle East Region: a Case Study of Lebanon’s Road Transport Sector,"The road transport system in Lebanon is one of the most unsustainable in the Middle East region due to, in large part, the absence of a national transportation strategy. This study proposes mitigation measures based on Lebanon’s commitments for reducing fossil fuel use and CO_2 emissions from road transport by increasing the share of fuel-efficient and hybrid electric vehicles and increasing the utilization of the existing bus service. Results show that increasing the market share of fuel-efficient vehicles to 35% in 2040 stabilizes energy use and emissions. The addition of hybrid vehicles to the first strategy, with a target of 10% market share by 2040, leads to 11% additional savings. Increasing the share of bus passenger kilometers traveled to 45% in 2040 leads to a reversal of adverse impacts. A combined strategy of all three measures leads to 63% reductions in 2040 compared to 2010, which is even superior to their cumulative savings.",2018-06-01,10.1007/s10666-017-9579-x,"['Haddad, Marc Georges', 'Mansour, Charbel Joseph', 'Afif, Charbel']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10666-017-9579-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1071,Techno-Economic Evaluation of Cellulosic Ethanol Production Based on Pilot Biorefinery Data: a Case Study of Sweet Sorghum Bagasse Processed via L+SScF,"Replacing fossil fuels with renewable fuels derived from lignocellulosic biomass can contribute to the mitigation of global warming and the economic development of rural communities. This will require lignocellulosic biofuels to become price competitive with fossil fuels. Techno-economic analyses can provide insights into which parts of the biofuel production process need to be optimized to reduce cost or energy use. We used data obtained from a pilot biorefinery to model a commercial-scale biorefinery that processes lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol, with a focus on the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP). The process utilizes a phosphoric acid-catalyzed pre-treatment of sweet sorghum bagasse followed by liquefaction and simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (L+SScF) of hexose and pentose sugars by an engineered Escherichia coli strain. After validating a techno-economic model developed with the SuperPro Designer software for the conversion of sugarcane bagasse to ethanol by comparing it to a published Aspen Plus model, six different scenarios were modeled for sweet sorghum bagasse Under the most optimistic scenario, the ethanol can be produced at a cost close to the energy-equivalent price of gasoline. Aside from an increase in the price of gasoline, the gap between ethanol and gasoline prices could also be bridged by either a decrease in the cost of cellulolytic enzymes or development of value-added products from lignin.",2018-06-01,10.1007/s12155-018-9906-3,"['Rijn, Rick', 'Nieves, Ismael U.', 'Shanmugam, K.

1072,Interactions between global climate change strategies and local air pollution: lessons learnt from the expansion of the power sector in Brazil,"This study examines the interactions between local air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions to assess potential synergies and trade-offs between local environmental pollution and climate policies, using the power generation sector in Brazil under different carbon scenarios up to 2050 as a case study. To this end, an integrated approach was developed, combining energy scenarios under different carbon mitigation targets and a local air pollution assessment model, tailored to the context of the Brazilian power sector. Results reveal that there are deep interactions between climate change mitigation and local air pollution abatement strategies. Increasing the diffusion of low-carbon technologies results in both mitigation of climate change and lower terrestrial acidification potential impacts, due to the rapid phase-out of fossil fuel power technologies. However, local air pollution indicators for particulate matter formation and human toxicity may rise in response to greenhouse gas emission mitigation constraints, indicating the existence of potential trade-offs. Some of these trade-offs can be offset by introducing available end-of-pipe pollution control measures reinforced by dedicated air quality policies.",2018-05-01,10.1007/s10584-018-2193-3,"['Portugal-Pereira, Joana', 'Koberle, Alexandre', 'Lucena, André F.

1073,Structural change as a key component for agricultural non-CO_2 mitigation efforts,"Agriculture is the single largest source of anthropogenic non-carbon dioxide (non-CO_2) emissions. Reaching the climate target of the Paris Agreement will require significant emission reductions across sectors by 2030 and continued efforts thereafter. Here we show that the economic potential of non-CO_2 emissions reductions from agriculture is up to four times as high as previously estimated. In fact, we find that agriculture could achieve already at a carbon price of 25 $/tCO_2eq non-CO_2 reductions of around 1 GtCO_2eq/year by 2030 mainly through the adoption of technical and structural mitigation options. At 100 $/tCO_2eq agriculture could even provide non-CO_2 reductions of 2.6 GtCO_2eq/year in 2050 including demand side efforts. Immediate action to favor the widespread adoption of technical options in developed countries together with productivity increases through structural changes in developing countries is needed to move agriculture on track with a 2 °C climate stabilization pathway. To achieve the climate target of the Paris Agreement substantial emission reductions will be required across economic sectors. Here the authors show that agriculture can make a significant contribution to non-CO_2 mitigation efforts through structural change in the livestock sector and the deployment of technical options.",2018-03-13,10.1038/s41467-018-03489-1,"['Frank, Stefan', 'Beach, Robert', 'Havlík, Petr', 'Valin, Hugo', 'Herrero, Mario', 'Mosnier, Aline', 'Hasegawa, Tomoko', 'Creason, Jared', 'Ragnauth, Shaun', 'Obersteiner, Michael']",Nature Communications,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03489-1.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1074,Major challenges of integrating agriculture into climate change mitigation policy frameworks,"Taking the European Union (EU) as a case study, we simulate the application of non-uniform national mitigation targets to achieve a sectoral reduction in agricultural non-carbon dioxide (CO_2) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Scenario results show substantial impacts on EU agricultural production, in particular, the livestock sector. Significant increases in imports and decreases in exports result in rather moderate domestic consumption impacts but induce production increases in non-EU countries that are associated with considerable emission leakage effects. The results underline four major challenges for the general integration of agriculture into national and global climate change mitigation policy frameworks and strategies, as they strengthen requests for (1) a targeted but flexible implementation of mitigation obligations at national and global level and (2) the need for a wider consideration of technological mitigation options. The results also indicate that a globally effective reduction in agricultural emissions requires (3) multilateral commitments for agriculture to limit emission leakage and may have to (4) consider options that tackle the reduction in GHG emissions from the consumption side.",2018-03-01,10.1007/s11027-017-9743-2,"['Fellmann, Thomas', 'Witzke, Peter', 'Weiss, Franz', 'Van Doorslaer, Benjamin', 'Drabik, Dusan', 'Huck, Ingo', 'Salputra, Guna', 'Jansson, Torbjörn', 'Leip, Adrian']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-017-9743-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1075,Nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions and nitrogen use efficiency as affected by nitrogen placement in lowland rice fields,"Urea deep placement (UDP) has demonstrated its benefits of saving N fertilizer and increasing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and grain yields. However, studies on its environmental impacts, particularly on nitrous oxide (N_2O) and nitric oxide (NO), are limited. We conducted multi-location field experiments in Bangladesh to determine the effects of UDP versus broadcast prilled urea (PU) on N_2O and NO emissions, NUE, and rice yields. N_2O and NO emissions were measured from three N fertilizer treatments—no N, UDP, and PU—using automated gas sampling and analysis systems continuously for two rice-growing seasons— Aus (May–August) and Aman (August–December). Fertilizer-induced peaks in N_2O emissions were observed after broadcast application of PU but were rarely observed after UDP. Total seasonal N_2O and NO emissions, yield-scaled emissions, and fertilizer-induced emissions were affected by fertilizer treatments and sites. Though nitrogen fertilizer increased emissions significantly over the control, emissions resulting from UDP and PU were similar. Effects of N placement on grain yields and NUE were site- and season-specific. Of the N placement methods, UDP increased grain yields by 13% ( p  < 0.05) during the Aman season and gave similar yields in spite of lower N application during the Aus season. UDP increased N recovery from 25 and 16% of broadcast PU to 61 and 73% during the Aus and the Aman seasons, respectively in one site, but was similar in another site. On the other hand, alternate wetting and drying irrigation reduced grain yield and N recovery at the BRRI site during the Aman season.",2018-03-01,10.1007/s10705-017-9897-z,"['Gaihre, Yam Kanta', 'Singh, Upendra', 'Islam, S.

1076,Implications of sustainable development considerations for comparability across nationally determined contributions,"To reduce emissions, countries have committed to nationally determined contributions (NDCs). However, countries are also committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and this study looks at the synergies between meeting NDCs and SDGs. An important component of the Paris Agreement is the assessment of comparability across nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Indeed, game-theory literature on international environmental agreements highlights the need for comparable emission-mitigation efforts by countries to avoid free-riding^ 1 . At the same time, there are well-recognized links between mitigation and other national priorities, including but not limited to the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)^ 2 – 6 , which raises the question of how such links might influence comparability assessments. Here, using a global integrated assessment model^ 7 , we demonstrate that geographical distributions of the influence of meeting the domestic mitigation component of the NDCs on a subset of the broader SDGs may not align with distributions of effort across NDCs obtained from conventional emissions-based or cost-based comparability metrics^ 8 – 11 . This implies that comparability assessments would be altered if interactions between mitigation and other SDGs were accounted for. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the extent to which these distributions differ depends on the degree to which mitigation activities directly affect broader SDGs domestically and indirectly affect international goals, and whether these effects are synergistic or antagonistic. Our analysis provides a foundation for assessing how comparability across NDCs could be better understood in the larger context of sustainability.",2018-02-01,10.1038/s41558-017-0039-z,"['Iyer, Gokul', 'Calvin, Katherine', 'Clarke, Leon', 'Edmonds, James', 'Hultman, Nathan', 'Hartin, Corinne', 'McJeon, Haewon', 'Aldy, Joseph', 'Pizer, William']",Nature Climate Change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-017-0039-z.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

A Micro Thermal Power Plant (MTP), which is a compact and small-scale biomass thermal power plant technology, can be used in electricity generation in thermal power plants with a power capacity up to 800 kW_el. This paper presents a feasibility analysis of a 300 kW_el MTP that is fuelled by rice husks using two different scenarios: the autoproduction (Case 1) and the independent production (Case 2) of electricity. Both scenarios were found to be unfeasible. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the variables that affect feasibility, such as the electricity commercialization price, the value of certified emission reductions and the financial interest rates. According to sensitivity analysis, small-scale thermal power plants could have feasibility if they received incentives through government programmes, such as through the exemption of equipment taxes and/or the reduction or elimination of the financial interest rate.",2018-02-01,10.1007/s10668-016-9871-y,"['Mayer, Flávio Dias', 'Gallon, Roger', 'Hoffmann, Ronaldo']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-016-9871-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1078,"The Role of Planning Laws and Development Control Systems in Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Analysis from New South Wales, Australia","Integrating emissions reduction into planning and environmental laws is a crucial mechanism in helping sub-national states or provinces play a role in climate change mitigation measures. In states like New South Wales (NSW), the absence of an integrated approach to considering and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a critical law and policy gap that needs to be addressed. This chapter focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) and sets out how planning and development control systems can be part of the solution for achieving emissions reduction targets. It highlights two major structural barriers to taking effective action to reduce emissions in NSW, Australia’s most populous state. The first is the lack of legislated or binding greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, supported by regulatory infrastructure or agency responsibility for reducing emissions. The second is the lack of integration between the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the land-use planning system. This chapter focuses on the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) because most greenhouse gas emissions from NSW are authorised by planning and development approvals (explicitly or otherwise). It considers six key stages of the NSW planning system that are relevant to greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Within each of these key stages, the chapter illustrates how greenhouse gas emissions are currently dealt with and how the law can be improved to help reduce emissions. Overall, the aim of this chapter is to make clear that planning and development agencies and decision-makers need stronger laws and guidance on achieving emissions control.

1079,Introduction: Pathways to a Sustainable Economy,"The purpose of this volume, as articulated in the title and under the aims and objectives presented in this introductory chapter, is indeed unique with respect to making a case of promoting sustainable use of resources and bring down pollution targets keeping the COP21 agenda in Paris in mind. It is now established that climate change has affected every continent, from the equator to the poles, from the mountains to the coasts. The many kinds of extremes that climate change has contributed so far are heat waves, heavy rain and untimely floods, wildfires, drought and melting ice and snow contributing to sea level rise. This volume is based on a conference held in Brisbane, Australia in November 2016—1 year on from COP21. The main objective of this conference was to identify the key issues that need to be addressed in order for nations to achieve their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) proposed at COP21. With this in mind, this volume has focused on how one can add further to the present debate on emission control globally involving both developed and developing nations of the Asia-Pacific. This introductory chapter gets the debate to a level where it will be clear to readers how the aims and objectives of the volume can be achieved. The focus of this volume, thus, is on identifying solutions to the challenges facing governments, businesses and civil society from countries in the Asia-Pacific region in meeting mitigation targets. In other words, the aims are to: offer critical perspectives on the COP21 agreement and the challenges of meeting the targets; offer solutions to challenges of achieving a sustainable economy using climate change mitigation as a driver for change; and provide cases in Australia and Asia that can exemplify how such challenges can be faced. The overall outcome of the volume suggests that there are considerable challenges for nations to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement in 2015. In this volume, the efforts of the contributors were to analyse how to bridge the gap between COP21 commitments and targets of emissions control while employing an interdisciplinary approach.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-67702-6_1,"['Hossain, Moazzem']",Pathways to a Sustainable Economy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-67702-6_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

The chapter explores the conditions for promoting forest conservation through foreign aid, taking into account the varying interests of multiple actors. The authors warn that while REDD+ financing, catalysed by foreign aid, has the potential to move beyond traditional sustainable forest management efforts, the mechanism still faces uncertainty over the long-term sustainability of financing, thus affecting the scalability of the mechanism.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-981-10-5379-5_8,"['Pascual, Unai', 'Garmendia, Eneko', 'Phelps, Jacob', 'Ojea, Elena']",Aid Effectiveness for Environmental Sustainability,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-10-5379-5_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1081,Mitigation of Global Warming Potential for Cleaner Composting,"With the rapidly growing human population, urbanization, and the uplifting living standards in all over the world, huge amount of solid waste was generated. It is expected that the entire amount of word solid waste production would climb from more ~3.5 million to >6 million tons/day from 2010 to 2025, and the rate would continue to increase and reach a peak to over 11 million tons/day about by the year 2100. Thus, how to manage those increasing solid waste generation was becoming a great issue for the sustainable civil infrastructure. Organic waste, which includes food scraps, yard wastes, agricultural wastes, and process residues, took the largest proportion of the overall generated solid waste by 46%. But ~90% of the solid waste is directly disposed into the landfill that can produce a considerable proportion of flue gases (generally the CH_4 and N_2O gases) due to the anaerobic mineralization of bio-available organic matter. Composting is an eco-friendly alternative “Old & Gold” technology to landfilling for the management of organic waste. Its principal interest lies in its potential to recycle the organic nutrients through compost application. The life cycle measurement has been extensively used as a mean of evaluation for impact assessment, such as overall warming potential, along with different waste management technologies. The typical methods assumed for composting comprise transportation of organic waste, viable machinery, greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions during the curing phase, as well as the end-product application. There is a divergence in the adopted operational methodology to determine its environmental effect. This chapter deliberates on the variations of life cycle computation of solid waste management that involved different global warming potentials of composting. It is also based on the GHGs mitigation approaches to minimize the global warming impact by aerobic composting. The element of the study is to examine the difference in the inventory investigation for composting, and its fundamental mechanism and the significant inventory for an additional assessment. This study establishes that the GHGs emissions which emit directly during the composting process supply additional global warming prospective rather than further emissions. The bulking agent is used for the mitigation of overall warming potential. The measurement of the composting and its impact on global warming prospective is widely dependent on many defined efficient components. The environmental impact should be examined based on the operational approach and the input feedstock to generate a basis with minimized discrepancies among studies. Consecutive exercise is compulsory to evaluate the everlasting assistance of composting on environment, health, and soil properties to further identify its effect as a cleaner technology. Demonstration of mitigation method of field-research is an essential step toward the acquiescence of organic farming with global GHGs emissions moderation object through composting. Therefore, in this chapter, provides a detailed account of the technological advancement and composting approaches in global prospects for mitigation of GHGs emission, environmental safety, and human health protection.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-981-10-7434-9_16,"['Awasthi, Mukesh Kumar', 'Sarsaiya, Surendra', 'Wang, Quan', 'Wang, Meijing', 'Chen, Hongyu', 'Ren, Xiuna', 'Kumar, Sunil', 'Zhang, Zengqiang']",Biosynthetic Technology and Environmental Challenges,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-10-7434-9_16,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1082,Integrated farming systems for improving soil carbon balance in the southern Amazon of Brazil,"Integrated farming systems (IS) are one of the main strategies of the Brazilian government to reduce or compensate for carbon emissions from agriculture with simultaneous improvement in production efficiency. The IS are agricultural production systems that combine crop, livestock and forestry activities in the same area. The aim of this study was to address soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks under two agriculture areas with IS, in comparison with one exclusively used as low-input pasture (Pasture). The IS consisted of growing forestry species ( Eucalyptus urograndis ) simultaneously with soybean ( Glycine max ) and aerobic rice ( Oryza sativa ) for 2 years when grain crops were followed by palisade grass ( Urochloa bryzantha ). The study was carried out in real farm conditions in the southern Amazon ecosystem, north of Mato Grosso State, Brazil. SOC stocks were measured to 1 m soil depth. Compared to Pasture, areas of higher SOC stocks were identified in IS under the tree lines below 0.3 m, where there was no soil N deficiency. Our results indicated that, under the local edaphic and climatic conditions of the study, IS with trees can promote SOC accumulation even in a short term, such as 3 years in this case study, if soil fertility constraints do not exist.",2018-01-01,10.1007/s10113-017-1146-0,"['Oliveira, Janaína de Moura', 'Madari, Beata Emoke', 'Carvalho, Márcia Thaís de Melo', 'Assis, Paula Camylla Ramos', 'Silveira, André Luiz Rodrigues', 'Leles Lima, Mateus', 'Wruck, Flávio Jesus', 'Medeiros, João Carlos', 'Machado, Pedro Luiz Oliveira de Almeida']",Regional Environmental Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10113-017-1146-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

Climate change impacts are many and varied, and this paper provides only first-order approximations. In the agriculture sector, the paper has looked only at output losses of three major food crops—rice, maize and wheat. While the health impacts of climate change include mortality at old age due to heat waves, this paper has focused on deaths related to three important diseases—diarrhea, malaria, and dengue.

1084,Promoting Climate-Smart Agriculture Through Water and Nutrient Interactions Options in Semi-arid West Africa: A Review of Evidence and Empirical Analysis,"In this paper, we analysed the ability of a range of existing technologies and practices and explored how their outcomes are linked to climate change adaptation and mitigation in West Africa. The rapid population growth alongside poor land use and management resulted in soil and water erosion, desertification, and salinization, creating a spiralling decline in the productivity of the land for food and other ecosystem services. Climate change brings additional threats arising from stresses and shocks caused by higher temperatures and lack of rainfall. Thus, farmers need to utilize agricultural strategies that sustainably increase productivity, resilience, while reducing GHGs emissions where possible. In order to implement such climate-smart agriculture options in semi-arid West Africa, water has to be available for crop nutrient uptake in the right amounts and at the right time, as water stress during plant growth results in major yield reductions for most crops. Also, farmers need to use more inorganic fertiliser, while striking the right balance between managing soil organic matter, fertility and moisture content and the use of fertilisers. The most successful systems are those that provide water, nutrients and a supportive soil structure in a synergistic manner. Indeed, we found that technologies such as zaï , half-moons, stone bunds combined with application of organic/inorganic sources of nutrients, are promising climate-smart agriculture practices that could be widely used by smallholder farmers to maintain food production and secure farmers’ livelihoods, while possibly protecting the environment. These successful examples can serve as inspiration for future policies and investments that pursue food security goals at all scales.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-58792-9_15,"['Zougmoré, Robert']","Improving the Profitability, Sustainability and Efficiency of Nutrients Through Site Specific Fertilizer Recommendations in West Africa Agro-Ecosystems",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-58792-9_15,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

It emphasises the contribution of systems thinking and the social sciences such as political economy to understanding the challenges and opportunities. The Kaya identity is examined as a useful tool to understand emissions trends and driving forces, but one that may ignore development issues. The interaction of emissions driving forces with the phenomena of ‘inertia’ and ‘carbon lock-in’ is discussed. It looks at how sustainable development pathways can help to deliver a lower emissions trajectory, and introduces the importance of ethics, values and policies.

1086,Sustainable Production of Biofuels from Weedy Biomass and Other Unconventional Lignocellulose Wastes,"The energy demand for different sectors is gradually escalating due to increase in population, urbanization and industrialization. Simultaneously, there is immense progression in the area of second generation biofuel for transportation sector. Inventors of automotive engines had envisioned farm-grown energy sources to play an important role in supplying fuel to run these vehicles. Maize, sugarcane and sugar beets are the main traditional substrates used for biofuel production. In Indian prospective, it is imperative to search for non-food feedstocks for long-term sustainability and economic viability of Indian bioethanol market. Hence, cellulosic materials such as unconventional agro-residues, fibrous crops and weedy biomass are attractive feedstock for bio-ethanol production. The excessive growth rate and wider adaptability of the weed biomass without any fertilizer input makes them a potential renewable source for ethanol production. The bioenergy production from these renewable resources can provide a higher degree of national energy security in an environment friendly, cost-effective and sustainable manner. However the data about biomass production, its availability and supply chain management options including transportations is still lacking. Moreover many potential weedy biomasses are mostly growing on community or degraded lands which make it difficult to collect the biomass for any commercial purposes. This chapter highlights the overview of unconventional fibres crops and weedy biomass as renewable resources for biofuel production.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-95480-6_4,"['Adak, Anurup', 'Singh, Surender', 'Lavanya, A.

1087,Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions from Solid Waste Management: Prognosis of Related Issues,"The implementation of cleaner waste treatment technologies in developing countries is accompanied by myriads of limitations and obstacles. This study reports that greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions that would not have happened with business-as-usual scenarios are achievable in the waste management system under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The grounds for CDM failures and successes were reviewed by reflecting on the past and current episodes in developing countries. It was found that economic development was directly proportional to increase in waste generation rate and influenced waste composition. The need to decouple waste production from Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and linking the prevalence of more low-carbon emissions waste treatment options were found essential to ensure sustainable development and mitigate climate change. Based on the present evaluation, Brazil and Thailand have had the largest number of CDM projects and mostly small-scale projects with the highest maximum emission reductions in Brazil (751, 148 Mt CO_2e) followed by Vietnam (158, 727 Mt CO_2e) and India (158, 077 Mt CO_2e). It was found that small-scale projects were more feasible as technology transfer and financial status were hindering the implementation of large-scale CDM projects. Moreover, emissions trading through CDM were accompanied by technical obstructions in terms of carbon leakage, permit allowances and unfair carbon price with irregular international policies and regulations to control GHGs. This study highlights the potential of a carbon trading scheme through CDM waste management projects designed to aid highly polluting developed countries achieve their target baselines for carbon emissions. The increasing GHG emissions in developing and least developed countries could be tackled at the early stages of economic growth through financial and technological assistance from industrialized countries.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-63612-2_22,"['Leelah, Sunjaya', 'Mudhoo, Ackmez']","The Nexus: Energy, Environment and Climate Change",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-63612-2_22,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1088,Biophysical Limits and Sustainable Management,"Adoption of collaborative governance has broadened strategic thinking in Canterbury from increased water availability through storage on alpine rivers, to sustainable management of water for multiple uses of importance to the community. Furthermore, improved water use efficiency was found to be a more effective way of increasing water availability. Water availability matters still to be resolved include: adaptation to climate change, institutional arrangements for infrastructure provision, and, measurement and management for enhanced water use efficiency. Failure pathway analysis highlighted effects of water abstraction on river flows and groundwater levels, as well as effects of land use intensification on freshwater quality on nutrient, bacterial and sediment contamination. Nested adaptive system analysis found current levels of management interventions are insufficient to achieve sustainable outcomes. Also, greater attention is needed to the interactions between surface and groundwater for managing water quantity and quality issues. Climate change Climate change projections indicate higher temperatures increasing potential evapotranspiration rates thereby increasing irrigation demand. Also, water availability Water availability in irrigation seasons is expected to decline from reduced winter rainfall to recharge aquifers and maintain lowland streamflow, lower foothill river flow, and changing flow patterns in alpine rivers from reduced snowmelt and increased winter rainfall. Higher winter flows in alpine rivers could be used to recharge aquifers. Use of a nested approach for the region has demonstrated that at finer spatial scales Spatial scale there are differences in community priorities, differences in failure pathways, and differences in sustainability strategies Sustainability strategies . Introducing resilience Resilience approaches assessments, sustainability strategies Sustainability strategies and managing cumulative effects Cumulative effects places a greater reliance on modelling and monitoring Monitoring .

At one hand, this means that consumerism is on the rise, but on the other hand, this puts businesses under extreme pressure to innovate and take future proofing actions. The traditional approach of take-make-dispose for consumer products is being challenged by circular economy and sustainability practices across the value chain. These practices can provide companies with competitive advantage through resource efficiency. Latest market research shows that consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the need for environmental and social performance of companies in addition to financial performance, leading to heightened expectations from their preferred brands. Leading companies are cognizant of these changes and increasing risks posed by social and environmental issues. As a result, companies are taking strategic approach in the context of positively impacting environmental and social ecosystem both inside and outside the business.

1096,Effect of Stover Management and Nitrogen Fertilization on N_2O and CO_2 Emissions from Irrigated Maize in a High Nitrate Mediterranean Soil,"A high soil nitrogen (N) content in irrigated areas quite often results in environmental problems. Improving the management practices of intensive agriculture can mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study compared the effect of maize stover incorporation or removal together with different mineral N fertilizer rates (0, 200 and 300 kg N ha^−1) on the emission of nitrous oxide (N_2O) and carbon dioxide (CO_2) on a sprinkler-irrigated maize ( Zea mays L.). The trail was conducted in the Ebro Valley (NE Spain) in a high nitrate-N soil (i.e. 200 g NO_3–N kg^−1). Nitrous oxide and CO_2 emissions were sampled weekly using a semi-static closed chamber and quantified using the photoacoustic technique in 2011 and 2012. Applying sidedress N fertilizer tended to increase N_2O emissions whereas stover incorporation did not have any clear effect. Nitrification was probably the main process leading to N_2O. Denitrification was limited by the low soil moisture content (WFPS < 54%), due to an adequate irrigation management. Emissions ranged from − 0.11 to 0.36% of the N applied, below the IPCC ( 2007 ) values. Nitrogen fertilization tended to reduce CO_2 emission, but only in 2011. Stover incorporation increased CO_2 emission. Nitrogen use efficiency decreased with increasing mineral fertilizer supply. The application of N in high N soils of the Ebro Valley is not necessary until the soil restores a normal mineral N content, regardless of stover management. This will combine productivity with keeping N_2O and CO_2 emissions under control provided irrigation is adequately managed. Testing soil NO_3 ^−–N contents before fertilizing would improve N fertilizer recommendations.",2017-12-19,10.1007/s11270-017-3660-6,"['Maris, S.

1097,Mapping and linking supply- and demand-side measures in climate-smart agriculture. A review,"Climate change and food security are two of humanity’s greatest challenges and are highly interlinked. On the one hand, climate change puts pressure on food security. On the other hand, farming significantly contributes to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This calls for climate-smart agriculture—agriculture that helps to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Climate-smart agriculture measures are diverse and include emission reductions, sink enhancements, and fossil fuel offsets for mitigation. Adaptation measures include technological advancements, adaptive farming practices, and financial management. Here, we review the potentials and trade-offs of climate-smart agricultural measures by producers and consumers. Our two main findings are as follows: (1) The benefits of measures are often site-dependent and differ according to agricultural practices (e.g., fertilizer use), environmental conditions (e.g., carbon sequestration potential), or the production and consumption of specific products (e.g., rice and meat). (2) Climate-smart agricultural measures on the supply side are likely to be insufficient or ineffective if not accompanied by changes in consumer behavior, as climate-smart agriculture will affect the supply of agricultural commodities and require changes on the demand side in response. Such linkages between demand and supply require simultaneous policy and market incentives. It, therefore, requires interdisciplinary cooperation to meet the twin challenge of climate change and food security. The link to consumer behavior is often neglected in research but regarded as an essential component of climate-smart agriculture. We argue for not solely focusing research and implementation on one-sided measures but designing good, site-specific combinations of both demand- and supply-side measures to use the potential of agriculture more effectively to mitigate and adapt to climate change.",2017-12-11,10.1007/s13593-017-0475-1,"['Scherer, Laura', 'Verburg, Peter H.']",Agronomy for Sustainable Development,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13593-017-0475-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1098,A new way of carbon accounting emphasises the crucial role of sustainable timber use for successful carbon mitigation strategies,"The roles of forest management and the use of timber for energy in the global carbon cycle are discussed. Recent studies assert that past forest management has been accelerating climate change, for example in Europe. In addition, the increasing tendency to burn timber is an international concern. Here, we show a new way of carbon accounting considering the use of timber as a carbon neutral transfer into a pool of products. This approach underlines the robust, positive carbon mitigation effects of sustainable timber harvesting. Applying this new perspective, sustainable timber use can be interpreted not as a removal but a prevention of carbon being converted within the cycle of growth and respiration. Identifying timber use as a prevention rather than a removal leads to the understanding of timber use as being no source of carbon emissions of forests but as a carbon neutral transfer to the product pool. Subsequently, used timber will then contribute to carbon emissions from the pool of forest products in the future. Therefore, timber use contributes to carbon mitigation by providing a substantial delay of emissions. In a second step, the carbon model is applied to results of a previous study in which different timber price scenarios were used to predict timber harvests in Bavarian forests (Germany). Thus, the influence of the economic dimension “timber price” on the ecological dimension carbon sequestration was derived. It also shows that these effects are stable, even if an increasing tendency of burning timber products for producing energy is simulated. Linking an economic optimization to a biophysical model for carbon mitigation shows how the impact of management decisions on the environment can be derived. Overall, a sustainably managed system of forests and forest products contributes to carbon mitigation in a positive, stable way, even if the prices for (energy) wood rise substantially.",2017-12-01,10.1007/s11027-016-9720-1,"['Härtl, Fabian H.', 'Höllerl, Sebastian', 'Knoke, Thomas']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-016-9720-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

In this work we looked at the N_2O mitigation capacity of two dimethylpyrazol-based NIs, 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) and 2-(N-3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) succinic acid isomeric mixture (DMPSA), on soil nitrifying and denitrifying microbial populations under two contrasting soil water contents (40% and 80% soil water filled pore space; WFPS). Our results show that DMPP and DMPSA are equally efficient at reducing N_2O emissions under 40% WFPS conditions by inhibiting bacterial ammonia oxidation. In contrast, at 80% WFPS DMPSA was less efficient than DMPP at reducing N_2O emissions. Interestingly, at 80% WFPS, where lowered oxygen availability limits nitrification, both DMPP and DMPSA not only inhibited nitrification but also stimulated N_2O reduction to molecular nitrogen (N_2) via nitrous oxide reductase activity (Nos activity). Therefore, in this work we observed that DMP-based NIs stimulated the reduction of N_2O to N_2 by nitrous oxide reductase during the denitrification process.",2017-10-23,10.1038/s41598-017-14225-y,"['Torralbo, Fernando', 'Menéndez, Sergio', 'Barrena, Iskander', 'Estavillo, José M.', 'Marino, Daniel', 'González-Murua, Carmen']",Scientific Reports,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14225-y.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1100,Threats to North American forests from southern pine beetle with warming winters,"The southern pine beetle is projected to be able to expand into vast areas of the northeastern US and southeastern Canada by 2050 posing risks to forest structure, biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. In coming decades, warmer winters are likely to ease range constraints on many cold-limited forest insects^ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Recent unprecedented expansion of the southern pine beetle (SPB, Dendroctonus frontalis ) into New Jersey, New York and Connecticut in concert with warming annual temperature minima highlights the risk that this insect pest poses to the pine forests of the northern United States and Canada under continued climate change^ 6 . Here we present projections of northward expansion in SPB-suitable climates using a statistical bioclimatic range modelling approach and current-generation general circulation model output under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5. Results show that by the middle of the twenty-first century, the climate is likely to be suitable for SPB expansion into vast areas of previously unaffected forests throughout the northeastern United States and into southeastern Canada. This scenario would pose a significant economic and ecological risk to the affected regions, including disruption of local ecosystem services^ 7 , shifts in forest structure^ 8 , and threats to native biodiversity^ 9 .",2017-10-01,10.1038/nclimate3375,"['Lesk, Corey', 'Coffel, Ethan', 'D’Amato, Anthony W.', 'Dodds, Kevin', 'Horton, Radley']",Nature Climate Change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3375.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1101,Increasing the application of gas engines to decrease China’s GHG emissions,"This paper employs a review of the technical literature to estimate the potential decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that could be achieved by increasing the application of gas engines in China in three sectors: urban public transport vehicle; shipping; and thermal power plants. China’s gas engine development strategies and three types of gas resource are discussed in the study, which indicates that gas engines could decrease GHG emissions by 520 megatonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO_2e) by 2020. This would account for 9.7 % of the government’s target for decreasing GHG emissions and is dominated by methane recovery from the use of coal mine gas (CMG) and landfill gas (LFG) for power generation. In the public urban transport vehicle and shipping sectors the low price of natural gas and the increasing demand for the control of harmful emissions could spur the rapid uptake of gas engine vehicles. However, the development of CMG- and LFG-fuelled power plants has been limited by the unwillingness of local enterprises to invest in high-performance gas engine generators and the associated infrastructure. Therefore, further compulsory policies that promote CMG use and LFG recovery should be implemented. Moreover, strict regulations on limiting methane leakage during the production and distribution of gas fuels are urgently needed in China to prevent leakage causing GHG emissions and largely negating the climate benefits of fuel substitution. Strategies for increasing the application of gas engines, promoting gas resources and recovering methane in China are instrumental in global GHG mitigation strategies.",2017-08-01,10.1007/s11027-016-9700-5,"['Feng, Liyan', 'Zhai, Jun', 'Chen, Lei', 'Long, Wuqiang', 'Tian, Jiangping', 'Tang, Bin']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-016-9700-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1102,Comparing the life cycle Greenhouse Gas emissions from vehicle production in China and the USA: implications for targeting the reduction opportunities,"China is responsible for around one-quarter of global vehicle production. The associated Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions have become a major concern to the industrial sustainable development. With the aim of identifying the opportunities of cutting GHG emissions from China’s automotive industry, this study estimates the life cycle GHG emissions from vehicle production in China and compares the results with the case in the USA from multiple perspectives. The results reveal that the GHG emissions from the production of a standard internal combustion engine-based passenger vehicle in China are around 9.6 ton per vehicle, 54% higher than the US level of 6.2 ton per vehicle. The power-intensive nature of vehicle production and China’s higher GHG emission intensity of power generation are the major reasons behind the difference. Accordingly, total GHG emissions from passenger vehicle production in China were around 173.9 million tons in 2013, accounting for nearly 3% of the GHG emissions from the manufacturing and construction sector. Based on the analysis, it is recommended that China should further optimize the grid mix and reduce the emission intensity of power generation. Besides, emission intensities of steel and aluminum productions should be further reduced through applying energy-efficient technologies and promoting material recycling.",2017-07-01,10.1007/s10098-016-1325-6,"['Hao, Han', 'Qiao, Qinyu', 'Liu, Zongwei', 'Zhao, Fuquan', 'Chen, Yisong']",Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10098-016-1325-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1103,"Biochar amendment reduces paddy soil nitrogen leaching but increases net global warming potential in Ningxia irrigation, China","The efficacy of biochar as an environmentally friendly agent for non-point source and climate change mitigation remains uncertain. Our goal was to test the impact of biochar amendment on paddy rice nitrogen (N) uptake, soil N leaching, and soil CH_4 and N_2O fluxes in northwest China. Biochar was applied at four rates (0, 4.5, 9 and13.5 t ha^−1 yr^−1). Biochar amendment significantly increased rice N uptake, soil total N concentration and the abundance of soil ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), but it significantly reduced the soil NO_3 ^−-N concentration and soil bulk density. Biochar significantly reduced NO_3 ^−-N and NH_4 ^+-N leaching. The C2 and C3 treatments significantly increased the soil CH_4 flux and reduced the soil N_2O flux, leading to significantly increased net global warming potential (GWP). Soil NO_3 ^−-N rather than NH_4 ^+-N was the key integrator of the soil CH_4 and N_2O fluxes. Our results indicate that a shift in abundance of the AOA community and increased rice N uptake are closely linked to the reduced soil NO_3 ^−-N concentration under biochar amendment. Furthermore, soil NO_3 ^−-N availability plays an important role in regulating soil inorganic N leaching and net GWP in rice paddies in northwest China.",2017-05-09,10.1038/s41598-017-01173-w,"['Wang, Yongsheng', 'Liu, Yansui', 'Liu, Ruliang', 'Zhang, Aiping', 'Yang, Shiqi', 'Liu, Hongyuan', 'Zhou, Yang', 'Yang, Zhengli']",Scientific Reports,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-01173-w.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1104,Ecosystem services in orchards. A review,"Arboriculture must maintain acceptable fruit production levels while preserving natural resources. This duality can be analyzed with the concept of ecosystem service. We reviewed the literature on orchards to explain how ecological functions modified by agricultural practices provide six ecosystem services - fruit production, climate regulation, soil nitrogen availability, water regulation, pest and disease control, and pollination - and which indicators could describe them. The major points are, first, that orchards have a high potential of multiple services. They can sequester from 2.4 to 12.5 t C/ha/year. Their perennial character and multi-strata habitat, as well as the opportunity of creating diversified hedgerows and cover crops in alleys, may contribute to a high level of biodiversity and related services. Second, every service depends on many functions. Fruit yield, which could reach up to 140 t/ha in apple orchards, is increased by light interception, carbon allocation, and nitrogen and water uptake. Third, agricultural practices in orchards have a strong impact on ecosystem functions and, consequently, on ecosystem services. Overfertilization enhances nitrogen leaching, which reduces soil nitrogen availability for the plant and deteriorates the quality of drained water. Groundcover increases humification and reduces denitrification and runoff, thus enhancing soil nitrogen availability and water regulation. It also enhances biotic interactions responsible for pest control and pollination. Pruning may increase fruit quality trough a better carbon allocation but decreases pest control by fostering the dynamics of aphids. To study multiple ecosystem services in orchards, we suggest using models capable of simulating service profiles and their variation according to management scenarios. We then refer to the available literature to show that conflicts between provisioning and regulating services can be mitigated by agricultural practices. Improved knowledge of soil processes and carbon balance as well as new models that address multiple services are necessary to foster research on ecosystem service relationships in orchards.",2017-04-04,10.1007/s13593-017-0422-1,"['Demestihas, Constance', 'Plénet, Daniel', 'Génard, Michel', 'Raynal, Christiane', 'Lescourret, Françoise']",Agronomy for Sustainable Development,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13593-017-0422-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1105,Predicting habitat suitability for the wart-biter bush cricket (Decticus verrucivorus) in Europe,"The wart-biter bush cricket is a relatively abundant species in mainland Europe, but has been declining at the northern edge of its range. With the predicted changes to the global climate that are expected to occur over the next century, it is probable that many species will shift their ranges polewards and to higher altitudes to track suitable climates. In this paper, a species distribution model was used to explore the effects of potential climate change scenarios on the distribution of the wart-biter bush cricket. The model predicts that suitable habitat will shift towards the north and to higher altitudes under a moderate climate change scenario, and that under severe climate change, the cricket will be left with very little suitable habitat in Europe. This highlights the threat of climate change to the species, but also the importance of maintaining the current habitat in the northern and high altitude areas of its range, as these areas may become important strongholds for the species in the future.",2017-04-01,10.1007/s10841-017-9975-1,"['Carne, Charlotte']",Journal of Insect Conservation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10841-017-9975-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1106,The analysis of greenhouse gas emissions/reductions in waste sector in Vietnam,"The global waste sector produces, on average, 2–5 % of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The amount of GHG emissions has grown steadily and is predicted to increase considerable in the forthcoming decades because of the increases in population and gross domestic product (GDP). However, the GHG mitigation opportunities for the sector are still fully not exploited, in particularly in developing countries. A series of initiatives were highly successful and showed that large reductions in emissions are possible. This study aims to propose a holistic quantification model, which can be used for estimation of waste generation and evaluation of the potential reduction of GHG emissions in waste sector for developing countries with a particular application to Vietnam. The two scenarios set for the study were business as usual (BaU) which waste management is assumed to follow past and current trends and CounterMeasure (CM) which alternative waste treatment and management are assessed. Total emissions in the BaU scenario are projected to increase from 29.47 MtCO_2eq in 2010 to 85.60 MtCO_2eq by 2030 and 176.32 MtCO_2eq by 2050. The highest emissions are due to methane (CH_4) released by disposal sites, accounting for about 60 % of the GHG emissions from waste in Vietnam in 2030. This emission is projected to increase significantly (67 % in 2050), unless more of the methane is captured and used for energy generation. The CM scenario gives emission reductions from 25.7 % (2020), 40.5 % (2030) to 56.6 % (2050) compared to the BaU scenario. The highest GHG reduction is achieved through recycling, followed by methane recovery to optimize the co-benefit for climate change mitigation.",2017-03-01,10.1007/s11027-015-9679-3,"['Hoa, Nguyen Thai', 'Matsuoka, Yuzuru']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-015-9679-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1107,Can savanna burning projects deliver measurable greenhouse emissions reductions and sustainable livelihood opportunities in fire-prone settings?,"Savannas constitute the most fire-prone vegetation type on earth and are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Most savanna fires are lit by people for a variety of livelihood applications. ‘Savanna burning’ is an accountable activity under the Kyoto Protocol, but only Australia, as a developed economy, accounts for emissions from this source in its national accounts. Over the past decade considerable effort has been given to developing savanna burning projects in northern Australia, combining customary indigenous (Aboriginal) approaches to landscape-scale fire management with development of scientifically robust emissions accounting methodologies. Formal acceptance by the Australian Government of that methodology, and its inclusion in Australia’s developing emissions trading scheme, paves the way for Aboriginal people to commercially benefit from savanna burning projects. The paper first describes this Australian experience, and then explores options for implementing community-based savanna burning emissions reduction projects in other continental savanna settings, specifically in Namibia and Venezuela. These latter examples illustrate that savanna fire management approaches potentially have broader application for contributing to livelihood opportunities in other fire-prone savanna regions.",2017-01-01,10.1007/s10584-013-0910-5,"['Russell-Smith, Jeremy', 'Monagle, Catherine', 'Jacobsohn, Margaret', 'Beatty, Robin L.', 'Bilbao, Bibiana', 'Millán, Adriana', 'Vessuri, Hebe', 'Sánchez-Rose, Isabelle']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-013-0910-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1110,Lessons from Taking Stock of 12 Years of Swiss International Cooperation on Climate Change,"A stronger focus on results achieved in international cooperation on climate change has become common in the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation SDC ( www.eda.admin.ch/sdc ) and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO ( www.seco.admin.ch ). In 2014 these agencies have commissioned an assessment on the effectiveness of more than 400 of their climate change interventions over the timeframe of 12 years (2000–2012). This paper presents the methodological approach of the assessment and its results. In a second step and most importantly, it summaries the challenges and lessons learnt of commissioning and conducting such a stock-taking exercise in the field of climate change. These lessons are addressed to evaluators, practitioners and policy makers. In general, the paper concludes that preparing such a report on the effectiveness of the international cooperation in climate change is indeed a very challenging exercise. More specifically, the paper argues that firstly many more efforts are needed from evaluators to identify best methodological practices in dealing with such a mass of information, the wide and highly diverse portfolio and a lack of good quantitative and qualitative data. Secondly, practitioners need to invest more in project design and in monitoring in order to provide accurate data as a basis for sound assessment. Finally, policy makers should be well aware of the significant investments needed for such assessments as an instrument of accountability. This paper thus contributes to the debate among interested stakeholders on the need for better results measurement and results reporting in international cooperation on climate change.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-43702-6_5,"['Egger Kissling, Monika', 'Windisch, Roman']",Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-43702-6_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1111,Modelling and Analysis of China’s Passenger Car Fuel Consumption up to 2030,"In this study, we present an analysis of future gasoline supply and consumption gap and a projection to future passenger car fuel consumption. In the first part, we study the gasoline and diesel supply from the refining sector in China. A virtual refinery model is established to analyze the productivity of gasoline and diesel. Based on the calculation of the model, we get minimum and maximum production of gasoline and diesel and the flexibility between them. In the second part, we study the ownership and sales of passenger car in China. A model for different types of passenger cars is established and many factors affecting the ownership are analyzed separately. Vehicle age distribution in passenger car is also taken into consideration. In the third part, alternative fuels and technologies for vehicles are studied. Fuel ethanol, natural gas, EV and PHEV are analyzed in detail. In the last part, we analyze the actual gasoline consumption rate and the average annual mileage of passenger car. Then we make an assumption as a basic scenario. Gasoline consumption in passenger car sector and other sectors in the future are calculated based on the assumption above. Gasoline consumption and supply are compared and a major finding is that the gasoline supply cannot meet the consumption since 2022 in basic scenario.

1116,Renewing Climate Planning Locally to Attend the 11th Sustainable Development Goal in the Tropics,"In the last seven years, tropical cities with a climate plan have tripled compared to the previous seven years. According to the 11th United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal, climate planning should significantly increase by 2030. The Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction ( 2015 ) and the New urban agenda signed in Quito ( 2016 ) indicate how to achieve this goal through analysis, categories of plans and specific measures. This chapter identifies the main obstacles to the significant increase in tropical human settlements with a climate plan and the possible solutions. First of all, the distribution and trend at 2030 of tropical human settlements are ascertained. Then local access to information on damage, hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk, and the consideration of these aspects in the national guides to local climate planning are verified. Lastly, the categories of plans and climate measures recommended by the United Nations are compared with those that are most common today, using a database of 401 climate plans for 338 tropical cities relating to 41 countries. The chapter highlights the fact that the prescription for treating tropical cities affected by climate change has been prepared without an accurate diagnosis. Significantly increasing climate planning must consider that small-medium human settlements in the Tropics will prevail at least until 2030. And most effort will be required from Developing and Least Developed Countries. The recommendations of the United Nations concerning the preliminary analyses ignore the fact that local authorities usually do not have access to the necessary information. Climate plans and recommended measures are not those currently in use. We propose three areas of action to facilitate the mainstreaming of the recommendations in the tropical context.

1117,Detecting sulphate aerosol geoengineering with different methods,"Sulphate aerosol injection has been widely discussed as a possible way to engineer future climate. Monitoring it would require detecting its effects amidst internal variability and in the presence of other external forcings. We investigate how the use of different detection methods and filtering techniques affects the detectability of sulphate aerosol geoengineering in annual-mean global-mean near-surface air temperature. This is done by assuming a future scenario that injects 5 Tg yr^−1 of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere and cross-comparing simulations from 5 climate models. 64% of the studied comparisons would require 25 years or more for detection when no filter and the multi-variate method that has been extensively used for attributing climate change are used, while 66% of the same comparisons would require fewer than 10 years for detection using a trend-based filter. This highlights the high sensitivity of sulphate aerosol geoengineering detectability to the choice of filter. With the same trend-based filter but a non-stationary method, 80% of the comparisons would require fewer than 10 years for detection. This does not imply sulphate aerosol geoengineering should be deployed, but suggests that both detection methods could be used for monitoring geoengineering in global, annual mean temperature should it be needed.",2016-12-15,10.1038/srep39169,"['Lo, Y.

1118,Assessment of nitrogen losses through nitrous oxide from abattoir wastewater-irrigated soils,"The land disposal of waste and wastewater is a major source of N_2O emission. This is due to the presence of high concentrations of nitrogen (N) and carbon in the waste. Abattoir wastewater contains 186 mg/L of N and 30.4 mg/L of P. The equivalent of 3 kg of abattoir wastewater-irrigated soil was sieved and taken in a 4-L plastic container. Abattoir wastewater was used for irrigating the plants at the rates of 50 and 100 % field capacity (FC). Four crop species were used with no crop serving as a control. Nitrous oxide emission was monitored using a closed chamber technique. The chamber was placed inside the plastic container, and N_2O emission was measured for 7 days after the planting. A syringe and pre-evacuated vial were used for collecting the gas samples; a fresh and clean syringe was used each time to avoid cross-contamination. The collected gas samples were injected into a gas chromatography device immediately after each sampling to analyse the concentration of N_2O from different treatments. The overall N_2O emission was compared for all the crops under two different abattoir wastewater treatment rates (50 and 100 % FC). Under 100 % FC (wastewater irrigation), among the four species grown in the abattoir wastewater-irrigated soil, Medicago sativa (23 mg/pot), Sinapis alba (21 mg/pot), Zea mays (20 mg/pot) and Helianthus annuus (20 mg/pot) showed higher N_2O emission compared to the 50 % treatments— M. sativa (17 mg/pot), S. alba (17 mg/pot), Z. mays (18 mg/pot) and H. annuus (18 mg/pot). Similarly, pots with plants have shown 15 % less emission than the pots without plants. Similar trends of N_2O emission flux were observed between the irrigation period (4-week period) for 50 % FC and 100 % FC. Under the 100 % FC loading rate treatments, the highest N_2O emission was in the following order: week 1 > week 4 > week 3 > week 2. On the other hand, under the 50 % FC loading rate treatments, the highest N_2O emission was recorded in the first few weeks and in the following order: week 1 > week 2 > week 3 > week > 4. Since N_2O is a greenhouse gas with high global warming potential, its emission from wastewater irrigation is likely to impact global climate change. Therefore, it is important to examine the effects of abattoir wastewater irrigation on soil for N_2O emission potential.",2016-11-01,10.1007/s11356-016-7438-y,"['Matheyarasu, Raghupathi', 'Seshadri, Balaji', 'Bolan, Nanthi S.', 'Naidu, Ravi']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-016-7438-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1119,Optimal pricing of the Taiwan carbon trading market based on a demand–supply model,"This study establishes theoretical models of supply and demand for carbon trading and proposes conditions for optimal trading prices and periods. Taiwan’s carbon market is used to verify the validity of the models. Simulations and empirical analysis position firms that emit greenhouse gases as the market buyers, and landowners that convert agricultural lands into plantation forests as the market sellers. The study compares four trading scenarios to determine optimal trading prices and time periods. There were four key conclusions. First, the higher the buyer’s cost to reduce carbon emissions, the higher the demand price is in the carbon trading market. The longer the trading period, the higher the carbon offsets, and the higher the demand price is for emissions trading. Second, the higher the emission trading price, the longer the optimal forest rotation period is for landowners. If emission costs do not exist at the time of logging, landowners are encouraged to log early, reducing the length of rotation periods. Furthermore, as the extension period in the trading scenarios increases, landowners’ costs increase, raising the market equilibrium price. Third, when landowners participate in forest carbon trading mechanisms or carbon subsidy policies, they may not always lengthen forest rotation periods. Therefore, if and when the government implements these mechanisms or policies, it should consider the factors affecting the length of forest rotation period. Finally, to respond to international interest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the government should design separate carbon programs and trading mechanisms for different types of private landowners. This would strengthen incentives for participating in the afforestation program.",2016-11-01,10.1007/s11069-015-2093-z,"['Liu, Wan-Yu', 'Wang, Qunwei']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-015-2093-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1120,Rice yields and nitrogen use efficiency with different fertilizers and water management under intensive lowland rice cropping systems in Bangladesh,"Optimum nitrogen rates and methods of application increase crop productivity and farm income while reducing negative environmental effects. Field experiments were conducted during four consecutive rice growing seasons in 2012–2013 to determine the effects of different N rates and methods of fertilizer application on floodwater ammonium concentration, rice yields and N use efficiency under two water regimes: continuous standing water and alternate wetting and drying (AWD). Fertilizer treatments included the use of deep placed urea briquettes and NPK briquettes (NPK), broadcast prilled urea (PU) and a control (without N). Deep placed fertilizer treatments irrespective of N rates and water regimes reduced floodwater ammonium similar to the control treatment, while broadcast PU treatment caused floodwater ammonium to increase as N rates increased. Deep placement of fertilizer above 52 and 78 kg N ha^−1 during the Aus – Aman seasons (wet seasons) and during the Boro season (dry season), respectively, had no significant effects on grain yields but reduced N recovery. Although the differences in grain yields among deep placed and PU treatments were not significant, deep placement of 30 % less N compared to broadcast PU significantly increased N recovery (30–35 % vs. 48–55 %). AWD irrigation increased grain yield by 16 % along with increased harvest index, particularly under deep placed treatments. However, the effects of AWD on yield varied with seasons suggesting the need for long-term studies across different rice growing seasons and sites to arrive at more definitive conclusions.",2016-11-01,10.1007/s10705-016-9795-9,"['Mofijul Islam, S.

1121,Leakage of nitrous oxide emissions within the Spanish agro-food system in 1961–2009,"In this paper we examine the trends of nitrous oxide (N_2O) emissions of the Spanish agricultural sector related to national production and consumption in the 1961–2009 period. The comparison between production- and consumption-based emissions at the national level provides a complete overview of the actual impact resulting from the dietary choices of a given country and allows the evaluation of potential emission leakages. On average, 1.5 % of the new reactive nitrogen that enters Spain every year is emitted as N_2O. Production- and consumption-based emissions have both significantly increased in the period studied and nowadays consumption-based emissions are 45 % higher than production-based emissions. A large proportion of the net N_2O emissions associated with imported agricultural goods comes from countries that are not committers for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Kyoto Protocol Annex I. An increase in feed consumption is the main driver of the changes observed, leading to a remarkable emission leakage in the Spanish agricultural sector. The complementary approach used here is essential to achieve an effective mitigation of Spanish greenhouse gas emissions.",2016-10-01,10.1007/s11027-014-9569-0,"['Lassaletta, Luis', 'Aguilera, Eduardo', 'Sanz-Cobena, Alberto', 'Pardo, Guillermo', 'Billen, Gilles', 'Garnier, Josette', 'Grizzetti, Bruna']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-014-9569-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1122,Heating requirements in greenhouse farming in southern Italy: evaluation of ground-source heat pump utilization compared to traditional heating systems,"Greenhouse farming, where energy consumptions are mainly related to the greenhouses heating, is one of the sectors consuming the most energy in the agricultural industry. High costs and the uncertain availability of fossil fuels constrain the use of heating applications. Among possible solutions, the utilization of renewable heating systems such as geothermal energy through ground-source heat pump systems (GSHPs) at competitive prices has to be taken in consideration. The competitiveness of these systems depends mainly on the characteristics of the end-users, i.e., the annual heating loads. Few studies focusing on the potential of using these systems start with an analysis of the thermal requirements and end with a cost evaluation in tune with local assets, geo-climatic conditions, and landscape protection. This paper analyzes the greenhouse crop industry in the Apulia region in southern Italy, as a potential end-user of GSHP systems. Data collected from an area mainly devoted to greenhouse crop production have been used to (a) describe greenhouse farms, (b) define the heating requirements of a greenhouse model representative of the most used typology in the investigated area, and (c) examine the economic viability of greenhouse heating with GSHP systems. Both vertical and horizontal ground heat exchanger (GHE) configurations are compared with conventional fossil-fuel heating systems. In all scenarios considered, the observed payback periods appear reasonable and worthy of consideration. The results suggest that these technologies can fully satisfy the winter heating requirements in a cost-effective way and they can support the planning of measures aimed to improve the sector competitiveness.",2016-10-01,10.1007/s12053-015-9410-y,"['D’Arpa, Stefania', 'Colangelo, Gianpiero', 'Starace, Giuseppe', 'Petrosillo, Irene', 'Bruno, Delia Evelina', 'Uricchio, Vito', 'Zurlini, Giovanni']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12053-015-9410-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1123,Urban high-resolution fossil fuel CO_2 emissions quantification and exploration of emission drivers for potential policy applications,"Fossil fuel carbon dioxide (FFCO_2) emissions are the largest driver of anthropogenic climate change. Approximately three-quarters of the world’s fossil fuels carbon dioxide emissions are generated in urban areas. We used the Hestia high resolution approach to quantify FFCO_2 for Salt Lake County, Utah, USA and demonstrate the importance of high resolution quantification to urban emissions mitigation policymaking. We focus on the residential and onroad sectors across both urbanized and urbanizing parts of the valley. Stochastic Impact by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) regression models using sociodemographic data at the census block group level shows that population, per capita income, and building age exhibit positive relationships while household size shows a negative relationship with FFCO_2 emissions. Compact development shows little effect on FFCO_2 emissions in this domain. FFCO_2 emissions in high income block groups is twice as sensitive to income than low income block groups. Emissions are four times as sensitive to household size in low-income versus high-income block groups. These results suggest that policy options targeting personal responsibility or knowledge feedback loops may be the most effective strategies. Examples include utility bill performance comparison or publicly available energy maps identifying high-emitting areas. Within the onroad sector, high emissions density (FFCO_2/km) is associated with primary roads, while high emissions intensity (FFCO_2/VMT) is associated with secondary roads. Opportunities exist for alignment of public transportation extension with remaining high emission road segments, offering a prioritization of new onroad transportation policy in Salt Lake County.",2016-09-01,10.1007/s11252-016-0553-1,"['Patarasuk, Risa', 'Gurney, Kevin Robert', 'O’Keeffe, Darragh', 'Song, Yang', 'Huang, Jianhua', 'Rao, Preeti', 'Buchert, Martin', 'Lin, John C.', 'Mendoza, Daniel', 'Ehleringer, James R.']",Urban Ecosystems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11252-016-0553-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1124,Conversion of a natural evergreen broadleaved forest into coniferous plantations in a subtropical area: effects on composition of soil microbial communities and soil respiration,"In this study, we examined how the conversion of native broadleaved forests into plantations of more productive forest species for timber use affects soil microbial community composition at 0–10-cm depth and soil respiration by comparing two 36-year-old plantation forests of Chinese fir ( Cunninghamia lanceolata , CF) and Pinus massoniana (PM) with an adjacent relict natural forest of Castanopsis carlesii (NF, ~200 years old) in Sanming, Fujian, China. The soil microbial community composition was determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. The monthly in situ soil respiration rate was measured from October 2010 to September 2012. Results showed that the abundance of Gram-negative bacterial PLFAs, actinomycetal PLFAs, and total PLFAs did not vary significantly with forest conversion. The CF soil was characterized by higher abundance of fungal PLFA and lower abundance of Gram-positive bacterial PLFA compared with NF and PM soils. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the significant change in the composition of soil microbial community was mainly due to fine root biomass and soil pH. Annual soil respiration rate averaged 161.7 mg C m^−2 h^−1 in NF, 95.1 mg C m^−2 h^−1 in CF, and 103.2 mg C m^−2 h^−1 in PM. The NF showed significantly higher mean annual soil CO_2 flux (1421 g C m^−2 year^−1) than CF (837 g C m^−2 year^−1) and PM (907 g C m^−2 year^−1). After forest conversion, the apparent temperature sensitivity of soil respiration ( Q _10) increased from 1.75 in NF to 2.04 and 1.98 in CF and PM, respectively. The mean annual soil respiration was significantly correlated with soil organic C (SOC) content and abundances of microbial PLFAs except for abundance of fungal PLFA, but not significantly correlated with fine root biomass (<2 mm in diameter) across the different forest soils. The latter behavior may be due to the higher fine root biomass in the CF than in the NF and PM. Our results suggest that studies incorporating the microbial community composition with soil respiration may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of soil C dynamics.",2016-08-01,10.1007/s00374-016-1120-x,"['Guo, Jianfen', 'Yang, Zhijie', 'Lin, Chengfang', 'Liu, Xiaofei', 'Chen, Guangshui', 'Yang, Yusheng']",Biology and Fertility of Soils,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00374-016-1120-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1125,"Review on carbon emissions, energy consumption and low-carbon economy in China from a perspective of global climate change","Accompanying the rapid growth of China’s population and economy, energy consumption and carbon emission increased significantly from 1978 to 2012. China is now the largest energy consumer and CO_2 emitter of the world, leading to much interest in researches on the nexus between energy consumption, carbon emissions and low-carbon economy. This article presents the domestic Chinese studies on this hotpot issue, and we obtain the following findings. First, most research fields involve geography, ecology and resource economics, and research contents contained some analysis of current situation, factors decomposition, predictive analysis and the introduction of methods and models. Second, there exists an inverted “U-shaped” curve connection between carbon emission, energy consumption and economic development. Energy consumption in China will be in a low-speed growth after 2035 and it is expected to peak between 6.19–12.13 billion TCE in 2050. China’s carbon emissions are expected to peak in 2035, or during 2020 to 2045, and the optimal range of carbon emissions is between 2.4–3.3 PgC/year (1 PgC=1 billion tons C) in 2050. Third, future research should be focused on global carbon trading, regional carbon flows, reforming the current energy structure, reducing energy consumption and innovating the low-carbon economic theory, as well as establishing a comprehensive theoretical system of energy consumption, carbon emissions and low-carbon economy.",2016-07-01,10.1007/s11442-016-1302-3,"['Shen, Lei', 'Sun, Yanzhi']",Journal of Geographical Sciences,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11442-016-1302-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1126,Paris Agreement climate proposals need a boost to keep warming well below 2 °C,"The principal climate goal of the Paris Agreement of December 2015 is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. This Perspective assesses the national plans submitted to the Paris meeting for post-2020 action to reduce global greenhouse gas emission by 2030. It also provides projections for global mean temperature increase over the twenty-first century that would be consistent with the present national plans and discusses options that may help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to levels that are more consistent with maintaining a reasonable chance of meeting the well below 2 degrees Celsius climate target. The Paris climate agreement aims at holding global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and to “pursue efforts” to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To accomplish this, countries have submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) outlining their post-2020 climate action. Here we assess the effect of current INDCs on reducing aggregate greenhouse gas emissions, its implications for achieving the temperature objective of the Paris climate agreement, and potential options for overachievement. The INDCs collectively lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to where current policies stand, but still imply a median warming of 2.6–3.1 degrees Celsius by 2100. More can be achieved, because the agreement stipulates that targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are strengthened over time, both in ambition and scope. Substantial enhancement or over-delivery on current INDCs by additional national, sub-national and non-state actions is required to maintain a reasonable chance of meeting the target of keeping warming well below 2 degrees Celsius. The objective of the Paris climate agreement is to limit global-average temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to further pursue limiting it to 1.5 degrees Celsius; here, the adequacy of the national plans submitted in preparation for this agreement is assessed, and it is concluded that substantial enhancement or over-delivery on these plans is required to have a reasonable chance of achieving the Paris climate objective.",2016-06-30,10.1038/nature18307,"['Rogelj, Joeri', 'den Elzen, Michel', 'Höhne, Niklas', 'Fransen, Taryn', 'Fekete, Hanna', 'Winkler, Harald', 'Schaeffer, Roberto', 'Sha, Fu', 'Riahi, Keywan', 'Meinshausen, Malte']",Nature,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18307.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1127,Quantifying uncertainties influencing the long-term impacts of oil prices on energy markets and carbon emissions,"Oil prices have fluctuated remarkably in recent years. Previous studies have analysed the impacts of future oil prices on the energy system and greenhouse gas emissions, but none have quantitatively assessed how the broader, energy-system-wide impacts of diverging oil price futures depend on a suite of critical uncertainties. Here we use the MESSAGE integrated assessment model to study several factors potentially influencing this interaction, thereby shedding light on which future unknowns hold the most importance. We find that sustained low or high oil prices could have a major impact on the global energy system over the next several decades; and depending on how the fuel substitution dynamics play out, the carbon dioxide consequences could be significant (for example, between 5 and 20% of the budget for staying below the internationally agreed 2 ^∘C target). Whether or not oil and gas prices decouple going forward is found to be the biggest uncertainty. The recent drop in oil prices is having a profound impact on global energy markets, raising questions about how these markets might evolve over the long term. This study uses scenarios to assess the energy and emissions impacts of diverging oil price futures and which uncertainties they depend upon.",2016-06-13,10.1038/nenergy.2016.77,"['McCollum, David L.', 'Jewell, Jessica', 'Krey, Volker', 'Bazilian, Morgan', 'Fay, Marianne', 'Riahi, Keywan']",Nature Energy,https://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy201677.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1128,The EU 40 % greenhouse gas emission reduction target by 2030 in perspective,"We assess the fairness and ambition level of the EU’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 % relative to 1990. For this, we calculate which reduction targets for other major emitting economies are comparable to the EU target, given widely diverging effort-sharing approaches. We introduce a novel approach in which the EU target is taken as starting point for allocating emission reductions to other regions. Under this approach, the global emission level is an outcome of the analysis, contrary to standard effort-sharing approaches in which the global climate goal is specified. We find that the INDC of the EU, if other regions take on comparable targets based on a differentiated convergence per-capita approach, could be sufficient for a global 2 °C pathway. However, if emissions are allocated according to a historical responsibility approach, the global emission level in 2030 is much higher than the level of 2 °C pathways. Furthermore, we conclude that India, Mexico, and Brazil have more ambitious INDCs than the EU according to both a differentiated convergence per-capita approach and a historical responsibility approach.",2016-06-01,10.1007/s10784-016-9317-x,"['Hof, A.

1129,Energy service company and financial market development: experiences of the Global Environment Facility,"Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) and the energy market for ESCO financing have been developing since 1976 when oil prices increased dramatically. ESCOs’ services cover projects in many energy areas, including energy extraction, power generation, energy conversion, transportation, power transmission, energy consumption, project financing, energy project audits, monitoring, and energy savings verification. In developing countries, there are many barriers in the energy market that are preventing ESCOs from developing. These barriers include lack of appropriate policy, financial mechanisms, and local capacities for ESCO development and management. Over the past 20 years, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) financed 39 ESCO projects in 25 countries and regions to remove these barriers. The results of these projects show that some countries, such as China, are very successful in ESCO development, but others are not. Different models of ESCOs in different financial markets in various countries are analyzed; and case studies are undertaken for China, India, Ukraine, and Brazil. This article concludes that, while developing financial markets for ESCOs, countries need to consider (1) initiating national government policy to stop energy subsidies and to reform energy pricing, (2) establishing a real, market based financial mechanism for ESCOs, (3) involving the private sector in project co-financing, (4) creating incentives to ESCOs in the market by investing part of government revenue from energy tax, and (5) incentivizing ESCOs by government corporate tax exemption.",2016-06-01,10.1007/s11027-014-9603-2,"['Yang, Ming']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-014-9603-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1130,Increasing beef production could lower greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil if decoupled from deforestation,"Modelling shows that increased beef production in the Brazilian Cerrado could lower greenhouse gas emissions and increase soil organic carbon stocks, provided that it is decoupled from deforestation. Recent debate about agricultural greenhouse gas emissions mitigation highlights trade-offs inherent in the way we produce and consume food, with increasing scrutiny on emissions-intensive livestock products^ 1 , 2 , 3 . Although most research has focused on mitigation through improved productivity^ 4 , 5 , systemic interactions resulting from reduced beef production at the regional level are still unexplored. A detailed optimization model of beef production encompassing pasture degradation and recovery processes, animal and deforestation emissions, soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics and upstream life-cycle inventory was developed and parameterized for the Brazilian Cerrado. Economic return was maximized considering two alternative scenarios: decoupled livestock–deforestation (DLD), assuming baseline deforestation rates controlled by effective policy; and coupled livestock–deforestation (CLD), where shifting beef demand alters deforestation rates. In DLD, reduced consumption actually leads to less productive beef systems, associated with higher emissions intensities and total emissions, whereas increased production leads to more efficient systems with boosted SOC stocks, reducing both per kilogram and total emissions. Under CLD, increased production leads to 60% higher emissions than in DLD. The results indicate the extent to which deforestation control contributes to sustainable intensification in Cerrado beef systems, and how alternative life-cycle analytical approaches result in significantly different emission estimates.",2016-05-01,10.1038/nclimate2916,"['de Oliveira Silva, R.', 'Barioni, L.

Each of these practices impacts a range of soil functions and ecosystem services, including water availability for crops, weed control, insect and pathogen control, soil quality and functioning, soil erosion control, soil organic carbon pool, environmental pollution control, greenhouse gas refuse, and crop yield productivity. In this study, we reviewed relevant bibliography and then developed a simple conceptual model, in which these soil functions and ecosystem services were scored and compared between conventional, conservation, and integrated agricultural systems. Using this conceptual model revealed that the overall agro-environmental score, excluding crop yield productivity, is largest for conservation systems (71.9 %), intermediate for integrated systems (68.8 %), and the smallest for conventional systems (52.1 %). At the same time, the crop yield productivity score is largest for integrated systems (83.3 %), intermediate for conventional systems (66.7 %), and the smallest for conservation systems (58.3 %).

1132,Amplification of Arctic warming by past air pollution reductions in Europe,"The Arctic region is warming considerably faster than the rest of the globe^ 1 , with important consequences for the ecosystems^ 2 and human exploration of the region^ 3 . However, the reasons behind this Arctic amplification are not entirely clear^ 4 . As a result of measures to enhance air quality, anthropogenic emissions of particulate matter and its precursors have drastically decreased in parts of the Northern Hemisphere over the past three decades^ 5 . Here we present simulations with an Earth system model with comprehensive aerosol physics and chemistry that show that the sulfate aerosol reductions in Europe since 1980 can potentially explain a significant fraction of Arctic warming over that period. Specifically, the Arctic region receives an additional 0.3 W m^−2 of energy, and warms by 0.5 °C on annual average in simulations with declining European sulfur emissions in line with historical observations, compared with a model simulation with fixed European emissions at 1980 levels. Arctic warming is amplified mainly in fall and winter, but the warming is initiated in summer by an increase in incoming solar radiation as well as an enhanced poleward oceanic and atmospheric heat transport. The simulated summertime energy surplus reduces sea-ice cover, which leads to a transfer of heat from the Arctic Ocean to the atmosphere. We conclude that air quality regulations in the Northern Hemisphere, the ocean and atmospheric circulation, and Arctic climate are inherently linked. The reasons for amplified warming in the Arctic are not clear. Simulations with an Earth system model suggest that the decline in European aerosol emissions since 1980 explains a substantial fraction of the warming.",2016-04-01,10.1038/ngeo2673,"['Acosta Navarro, J.

1133,Farm and product carbon footprints of China’s fruit production—life cycle inventory of representative orchards of five major fruits,"Understanding the environmental impacts of fruit production will provide fundamental information for policy making of fruit consumption and marketing. This study aims to characterize the carbon footprints of China’s fruit production and to figure out the key greenhouse gas emissions to cut with improved orchard management. Yearly input data of materials and energy in a full life cycle from material production to fruit harvest were obtained via field visits to orchards of five typical fruit types from selected areas of China. Carbon footprint (CF) was assessed with quantifying the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the individual inputs. Farm and product CFs were respectively predicted in terms of land use and of fresh fruit yield. Additionally, product CFs scaled by fruit nutrition value (vitamin C (Vc) content) and by the economic benefit from fruit production were also evaluated. The estimated farm CF ranged from 2.9 to 12.8 t CO_2-eq ha^−1 across the surveyed orchards, whereas the product CF ranged from 0.07 to 0.7 kg CO_2-eq kg^−1 fruit. While the mean product CFs of orange and pear were significantly lower than those of apple, banana, and peach, the nutrition-scaled CF of orange (0.5 kg CO_2-eq g^−1 Vc on average) was significantly lower than others (3.0–5.9 kg CO_2-eq g^−1 Vc). The income-scaled CF of orange and pear (1.20 and 1.01 kg CO_2-eq USD^−1, respectively) was higher than apple, banana, and peach (0.87~0.39 kg CO_2-eq USD^−1). Among the inputs, synthetic nitrogen fertilizer contributed by over 50 % to the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, varying among the fruit types. There were some tradeoffs in product CFs between fruit nutrition value and fruit growers’ income. Low carbon production and consumption policy and marketing mechanism should be developed to cut down carbon emissions from fruit production sector, with balancing the nutrition value, producer’s income, and climate change mitigation.",2016-03-01,10.1007/s11356-015-5670-5,"['Yan, Ming', 'Cheng, Kun', 'Yue, Qian', 'Yan, Yu', 'Rees, Robert M.', 'Pan, Genxing']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-015-5670-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1134,Integrating social–ecological vulnerability assessments with climate forecasts to improve local climate adaptation planning for coral reef fisheries in Papua New Guinea,"A major gap exists in integrating climate projections and social–ecological vulnerability analyses at scales that matter, which has affected local-scale adaptation planning and actions to date. We address this gap by providing a novel methodology that integrates information on: (i) the expected future climate, including climate-related extreme events, at the village level; (ii) an ecological assessment of the impacts of these climate forecasts on coral reefs; and (iii) the social adaptive capacity of the artisanal fishers, to create an integrated vulnerability assessment on coastal communities in five villages in Papua New Guinea. We show that, despite relatively proximate geographies, there are substantial differences in both the predicted extreme rainfall and temperature events and the social adaptive capacity among the five fishing-dependent communities, meaning that they have likely different vulnerabilities to future climate change. Our methodology shows that it is possible to capture social information and integrate this with climate and ecological modeling in ways that are best suited to address the impacts of climate-mediated environmental changes currently underway across different scales.",2016-03-01,10.1007/s10113-015-0807-0,"['Maina, Joseph', 'Kithiia, Justus', 'Cinner, Josh', 'Neale, Ezra', 'Noble, Sylvia', 'Charles, Daniel', 'Watson, James E.M.']",Regional Environmental Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10113-015-0807-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1135,Development Aid and Climate Finance,"This paper discusses the implications of climate change for official transfers from rich countries (the North) to poor countries (the South) when the motivation for transfers is ethical rather than strategic. Traditional development transfers to increase income and reduce poverty are complemented by new financial flows to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation transfers) and become climate-resilient (adaptation transfers). We find that in the absence of barriers to adaptation, mitigation or development, climate change will make isolated transfers less efficient: A large part of their intended effect (to increase income, reduce emissions, or boost climate-resilience) dissipates as the South reallocates its own resources to achieve the mitigation, adaptation and consumption balance it prefers. Only in the case of least-developed countries, which are unable to adapt fully due to income constraints, will adaptation support lead to more climate resilience. In all other cases, if the North wishes to change the balance between mitigation, adaptation and consumption it should structure its transfers as “matching grants”, which are tied to the South’s own level of funding. Alternatively, the North could provide an integrated “climate-compatible development” package that recognizes the combined climate and development requirements of the South. If the aim is to increase both mitigation and adaptation in the South, development assistance that increases the income level, can be an effective measure, but only if there is an international agreement and the recipient country is not income constrained. If the recipient country is very poor, development aid may reduce adaptation effort.",2016-02-01,10.1007/s10640-015-9883-3,"['Eyckmans, Johan', 'Fankhauser, Sam', 'Kverndokk, Snorre']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-015-9883-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1136,Policy trade-offs between climate mitigation and clean cook-stove access in South Asia,"Many people globally still use solid fuels for cooking and heating, leading to programmes designed to subsidize cleaner alternatives. This study analyses possible effects of climate mitigation policies on fuel costs and hence the effectiveness of such schemes. Household air pollution from traditional cook stoves presents a greater health hazard than any other environmental factor. Despite government efforts to support clean-burning cooking fuels, over 700 million people in South Asia could still rely on traditional stoves in 2030. This number could rise if climate change mitigation efforts increase energy costs. Here we quantify the costs of support policies to make clean cooking affordable to all South Asians under four increasingly stringent climate policy scenarios. Our most stringent mitigation scenario increases clean fuel costs 38% in 2030 relative to the baseline, keeping 21% more South Asians on traditional stoves or increasing the minimum support policy cost to achieve universal clean cooking by up to 44%. The extent of this increase depends on how policymakers allocate subsidies between clean fuels and stoves. These additional costs are within the range of financial transfers to South Asia estimated in efforts-sharing scenarios of international climate agreements.",2016-01-11,10.1038/nenergy.2015.10,"['Cameron, Colin', 'Pachauri, Shonali', 'Rao, Narasimha D.', 'McCollum, David', 'Rogelj, Joeri', 'Riahi, Keywan']",Nature Energy,https://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy201510.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

Additionally, other regional cooperation should be addressed which are energy trading in ASEAN for lowering GHG emissions and fostering energy security and stability in the region, also the environmental governance of energy trading must be concerned, the harmonization of energy efficiency standard and labeling, and the establishment of responsible agency focusing on low-carbon energy system in the regional as well as providing institutional capacity building to responsible agencies in ASEAN countries.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-981-10-0761-3_6,"['Chotichanathawewong, Qwanruedee']",Investing on Low-Carbon Energy Systems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-10-0761-3_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1139,From Resilience to Transformation Via a Regenerative Sustainability Development Path,"Urban resilience frameworks and strategies currently taken up in cities around the globe fall short of adequately preparing urban communities for the scale of change that many will face in coming decades. For cities aiming to address the impacts of climate change in a proactive sense as well as post-disaster, urban resilience presents itself as a useful frame, grounded in both ecological systems theory and psychological theory. This chapter tackles the question of where the notion of resilience helps, and where it holds cities back, in terms of urban planning and policy. Resilience in the urban planning and policy context may hold cities back because it lacks normative value in social and political spheres. That is, while concepts such as social justice and sustainable development suggest a normative direction for planning toward the improvement of our communities, resilience thinking does not imply any value-based criteria by which communities might determine how best to “bounce back” or “bounce forward.” Additional tools for urban resilience planning are needed, and we suggest and elaborate here upon two: the development path and regenerative sustainability. The notion of the development path originated within the IPCC process and draws upon futures studies, scenario planning and backcasting, in order to understand the social and political change and decision making implications of responding to climate change. The second concept we offer, regenerative sustainability, can be considered as the work of increasing the capacity of the current generation to give back more than we receive. The contribution of these two concepts to the value of urban resilience thinking in political contexts is explained through a discussion of five possible scenarios of urban transformation, which vary in terms of the social and political intentions at work in the strategies needed to build resilience.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-39812-9_15,"['Holden, Meg', 'Robinson, John', 'Sheppard, Stephen']",Urban Resilience,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-39812-9_15,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1140,Livestock Farming Constraints in Developing Countries—From Adaptation to Mitigation in Ruminant Production Systems,"The livestock sector’s relationship with climate change is complex. The sector is a major contributor to agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, whereas it is subject to climate change and must adapt to ensure its survival. The diverse range of livestock farming systems worldwide provides a range of greenhouse gas emission mitigation options. Moreover, livestock production contributes to a significant and increasing extent to food systems and to agricultural systems in developing countries (manure, transportation, savings, income). In this sense, their integration in climate-smart agricultural systems is essential, especially since these regions are undergoing major changes in their demographic, environmental and consumption patterns.

1141,Socio-economic Impacts—Air Quality,"In the North Sea region, poor air quality has serious implications for human health and the related societal costs are considerable. The state of air pollution is often used as a proxy for air quality. This chapter focuses on the two atmospheric pollutants of most significance to human health in Europe—particulate matter and ground-level ozone. These are also important ‘climate forcers’. In the North Sea area, the effects on air quality of emission changes since preindustrial times are stronger than the effects of climate change. According to model simulations, this is also the case for future air quality in the North Sea region, but substantial variation in model results implies considerable uncertainty. Short-term events such as heat waves can have substantial impacts on air quality and some regional climate models suggest that heat waves may become more frequent in the coming decades. If the reductions in air pollutant emissions expected through increasingly stringent policy measures are not achieved, any increase in the severity or frequency of heat waves may have severe consequences for air quality. Climate and air quality interact in several ways and mitigation optimised for a climate or air quality target in isolation could have synergistic or antagonistic effects.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-39745-0_16,"['Dalsøren, Stig Bjørløw', 'Jonson, Jan Eiof']",North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-39745-0_16,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1142,"Floodwater ammonium, nitrogen use efficiency and rice yields with fertilizer deep placement and alternate wetting and drying under triple rice cropping systems","Fertilizer management should consider optimum time, rates and methods of application to increase use efficiency and crop yield. We conducted field experiments at Bangladesh Agricultural University, Bangladesh, to investigate the effects of deep placement of urea briquettes (UB) and NPK briquettes (NPK) compared to broadcast prilled urea (PU) at different N rates on dynamics of floodwater NH_4 ^+-N, ammonia (NH_3) volatilization, rice yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) during four consecutive rice-growing seasons in 2012–2013. The floodwater NH_4 ^+-N and NH_3 volatilization in broadcast PU increased with N rates, while in deep-placed treatments irrespective of N rates it was similar to the control. Across seasons and water regime, UB or NPK significantly ( P  < 0.05) increased grain yield and nitrogen recovery compared to broadcast PU. During the Boro season (across water regime), UB78 and NPK78 increased grain yield by 40 and 29 %, respectively, compared to broadcast PU78, while N recovery increased from 35 % of PU to 63–67 % in deep placement. Deep placement of UB52 or NPK52 during Aus – Aman and UB78 or NPK78 during Boro can be one of the best N management options for increasing NUE and crop yield. Alternate wetting and drying irrigation, though, had no significant effect on grain yield or on NUE. Its adoption could save irrigation water without any yield reduction during the Boro season. However, more studies across different soils, climate and management practices are needed for further understanding the interactive effects of fertilizer and water management on yield, NUE and soil fertility.",2016-01-01,10.1007/s10705-015-9758-6,"['Huda, Azmul', 'Gaihre, Yam Kanta', 'Islam, M.

1145,Upgradation of Bio-oil Derived from Lignocellulose Biomass—A Numerical Approach,"The envisaged upgrading of lignocellulose biomass derived feed stock to partially replace crude oil is receiving much attention due to increasing demand for renewable and CO_2 neutral energy sources. One prospective method is to convert the biomass into bio-oil through pyrolysis and upgrading the pyrolytic oil into biofuel. The bio-oil has a high content of oxygen and therefore lowers the stability over the time and lowers the heating value as well. Hence, upgrading is desirable to remove the oxygen and enhance the properties of the bio-oil resembling as a second generation fuel which is an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process is found to be very promising route to upgrade pyrolysis bio-oil for producing liquid transportation fuels. The present study deals with the CFD modeling of hydrodynamics and reaction kinetics in a fluidized bed reactor using ANSYS Fluent 14.5. By integrating a lumped kinetic model with Eulerian multiphase fluid flow, a comprehensive model for the hydrodynamics and reaction kinetics for the upgradation of bio-oil is developed.

1146,"Global climate, energy, and economic implications of international energy offsets programs","We demonstrate and apply methods for assessing global, system-scale effects on energy and greenhouse emissions of offset programs that explicitly consider the rules by which energy-based offset credits are awarded. We compare our approach to idealized calculations in which all regions, including those without mitigation obligations, face a common carbon tax. We find a substantial gap between potential reductions in emissions and those realized in a suite of hypothetical offset assignment protocols as well as between offset creation and system-scales emissions mitigation, even when project-scale additionality and compliance issues are absent and baselines are known with certainty. In the worst cases, seemingly reasonable rules were counterproductive—i.e. increased global carbon emissions, despite strictly meeting additionality and baseline requirements. But, even when we modified the rules for creating offsets to reflect more closely implementation practices, there remained a large gap between potential and realized mitigation. This difference is systemic and traces to the basic nature of offsets. Offsets subsidize the deployment of non-emitting technologies instead of penalizing the use of emitting technologies. As a consequence, offsets lower the cost of energy, and encourage greater use energy rather than its conservation. Thus, even in well-crafted programs, it is impossible to capture the full economic potential because the program lacks a means by which to engage energy conservation. We demonstrate that while offsets programs reduce the cost to regions with emissions caps, they may achieve this result at the expense of reduced global emissions mitigation.",2015-12-01,10.1007/s10584-015-1482-3,"['Calvin, Katherine', 'Rose, Steven', 'Wise, Marshall', 'McJeon, Haewon', 'Clarke, Leon', 'Edmonds, Jae']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-015-1482-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1147,Policies for the Sustainable Development of Biofuels in the Pan American Region: A Review and Synthesis of Five Countries,"Rapid growth of biofuel production in the United States and Brazil over the past decade has increased interest in replicating this success in other nations of the Pan American region. However, the continued use of food-based feedstock such as maize is widely seen as unsustainable and is in some cases linked to deforestation and increased greenhouse gas emissions, raising further doubts about long-term sustainability. As a result, many nations are exploring the production and use of cellulosic feedstock, though progress has been extremely slow. In this paper, we will review the North–South axis of biofuel production in the Pan American region and its linkage with the agricultural sectors in five countries. Focus will be given to biofuel policy goals, their results to date, and consideration of sustainability criteria and certification of producers. Policy goals, results, and sustainability will be highlighted for the main biofuel policies that have been enacted at the national level. Geographic focus will be given to the two largest producers—the United States and Brazil; two smaller emerging producers—Argentina and Canada; and one stalled program—Mexico.

Crantz), as a bioenergy and bio-product feedstock, may be grown as a rotation crop in the wheat-based cropping system to increase land use efficiency in the Northern Great Plains (NGP). In this study, which was conducted from 2008 to 2011 in central Montana, we evaluated the energy balance of three 2-year cop rotational sequences that included camelina-winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) (CAM-WW) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.)-winter wheat (BAR-WW) compared with a traditional fallow-winter wheat (FAL-WW) rotation. Results indicated that 52 and 57 % more energy input was invested in CAM-WW and BAR-WW compared to FAL-WW system (9182 MJ ha^−1), respectively. In all rotations, nitrogen fertilizer was the most energy-consuming input and accounted for 76, 68, and 69 % of the total energy used in wheat, barley, and camelina production, respectively. Averaged over 3 years, CAM-WW and BAR-WW systems yielded 34 and 29 % greater gross energy output compared with FAL-WW. The CAM-WW and BAR-WW also outperformed FAL-WW by 30 and 6 % in terms of net energy output. No significant differences in energy efficiency were found between the FAL-WW and CAM-WW systems. Taking into account of the greater net energy as well as similar values of energy use efficiency, the CAM-WW system performed better than the traditional FAL-WW system under rainfed conditions in central Montana. There is a good potential to improve the energy efficiency of the CAM-WW cropping system (by more than 26 %) through refinement of agronomic practices, mainly nitrogen fertilization and herbicide application, which can further enhance the sustainability of camelina feedstock production.",2015-12-01,10.1007/s12155-015-9644-8,"['Keshavarz-Afshar, Reza', 'Chen, Chengci']",BioEnergy Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12155-015-9644-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1149,Multi-model comparison of the economic and energy implications for China and India in an international climate regime,"This paper presents a modeling comparison on how stabilization of global climate change at about 2 °C above the pre-industrial level could affect economic and energy systems development in China and India. Seven General Equilibrium (CGE) and energy system models on either the global or national scale are soft-linked and harmonized with respect to population and economic assumptions. We simulate a climate regime, based on long-term convergence of per capita carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions, starting from the emission pledges presented in the Copenhagen Accord to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and allowing full emissions trading between countries. Under the climate regime, Indian emission allowances are allowed to grow more than the Chinese allowances, due to the per capita convergence rule and the higher population growth in India. Economic and energy implications not only differ among the two countries, but also across model types. Decreased energy intensity is the most important abatement approach in the CGE models, while decreased carbon intensity is most important in the energy system models. The reduction in carbon intensity is mostly achieved through deployment of carbon capture and storage, renewable energy sources and nuclear energy. The economic impacts are generally higher in China than in India, due to higher 2010–2050 cumulative abatement in China and the fact that India can offset more of its abatement cost though international emission trading.",2015-12-01,10.1007/s11027-014-9549-4,"['Johansson, Daniel J.

1151,Residential energy efficiency standards in Australia: where to next?,"Increasing the energy and carbon efficiency of homes has been at the forefront of international climate change mitigation policy. In Australia, recent policy action led to the introduction of minimum energy efficiency standards for new homes within the Building Code of Australia in 2003, with subsequent stringency increases in 2006 and 2010. Although not yet reflecting international best regulatory practice, these standards represent substantial progress in addressing the energy and carbon emission impact of new homes, yet there are a number of energy policy challenges that highlight the need for further change. This paper documents the history of house energy standards in Australia and examines the post-occupancy evidence of that policy outcome. The paper examines international and domestic issues pointing to a possible future direction for Australian house energy regulation, highlighting the key drivers for change. In particular, we investigate the concepts of net zero carbon and net zero energy homes which have recently been adopted internationally, examining the technical and economic evidence that would support such a policy position in Australia.",2015-10-01,10.1007/s12053-015-9336-4,"['Berry, Stephen', 'Marker, Tony']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12053-015-9336-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1153,An Application of Automated Mediation to International Climate Treaty Negotiation,"A generic framework for automated mediation of multi-attribute negotiation has recently been reported (Lai and Sycara in Group Decis Negot 18:169–187, 2009 ). This framework seeks to shorten time to agreement, achieve agreements that are closer to Pareto optimality, and remain tractable in situations involving multiple issues, incomplete information, and dynamic reservation utility. These objectives are all relevant to international climate treaty negotiation. Therefore, in this paper, we describe how this mediation framework can be applied to the climate policy setting and articulate a necessary extension to allow for more than two negotiating parties. We then demonstrate application of the framework, employing some simple economic and procedural assumptions. This example shows that automated mediation can add value to the negotiation process without placing an undue mental or computational burden on negotiators. Part of this value comes simply from encouraging negotiators to be explicit about their assumptions and preferences, even if most of this information is not shared with their opponents.",2015-09-01,10.1007/s10726-014-9419-1,"['Ding, P.', 'Gerst, M.

1154,Effects of winter covering crop residue incorporation on CH_4 and N_2O emission from double-cropped paddy fields in southern China,"Residue management in cropping systems is useful to improve soil quality. However, the studies on the effects of residue management on methane (CH_4) and nitrous oxide (N_2O) emission from paddy field in southern China are few. Therefore, the emissions of CH_4 and N_2O were investigated in double cropping rice ( Oryza sativa L.) systems with different winter covering crops using the static chamber-gas chromatography technique to assess the effects of different covering crops on the emissions of greenhouse gases. The experiment was established in 2004 in Hunan Province, China. Three winter cropping systems were used: rice–rice–rape ( Brassica napus L.) (T1), rice–rice–potato with straw mulching ( Solanum tuberosum L.) (T2), and rice–rice with winter fallow (CK). A randomized block design was adopted in plots, with three replications. The results showed that T2 plots had the largest CH_4 emissions during the early and late rice growing season with 12.506 and 32.991 g m^−2, respectively. When compared to CK, total N_2O emissions in the early rice growth period and the emissions of the gas increased by 0.013 g m^−2 in T1 and 0.045 g m^−2 in T2, respectively. Similar results were obtained in the late rice growth period; the total N_2O emissions increased by 0.027 g m^−2 in T1 and 0.084 g m^−2 in T2, respectively. The mean value of global warming potentials (GWPs) of CH_4 and N_2O emissions over 100 years was in the order of T2 > T1 > CK, which indicated CK and T1 was significantly lower than T2 ( P  < 0.05). This suggests that adoption of T1 would be beneficial for greenhouse gas emission mitigation and could be a good option cropping pattern in double rice cropped regions.",2015-08-01,10.1007/s11356-015-4557-9,"['Tang, Haiming', 'Xiao, Xiaoping', 'Tang, Wenguang', 'Wang, Ke', 'Sun, Jimin', 'Li, Weiyan', 'Yang, Guangli']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-015-4557-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

To this end, after carrying out a classical convergence analysis, a more thorough investigation of the entire distribution is presented by examining its external shape, the intra-distribution dynamics and the long-run equilibrium distribution. This analysis reveals the existence of a weak, rather insignificant, convergence process and that large cross-country differences are likely to persist in the long-run. Next, as polarization indicators are a proper way of appraising potential conflict in international environmental negotiations, we test whether, or not, the distribution dynamics concurs with the presence of polarization. Our results indicate that two poles can be clearly differentiated, one with high and other with low non- $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ CO 2 generating energy shares. In view of these findings, and to ensure a fair transition to a sustainable energy system, the paper calls for the development of an ambitious clean energy agenda, especially in countries with low non- $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ CO 2 generating energy shares.",2015-07-01,10.1007/s10640-014-9794-8,"['Maza, Adolfo', 'Villaverde, José', 'Hierro, María']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-014-9794-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1156,"Introduction to the special issue on ozone layer protection and climate change: the extraordinary experience of building the Montreal Protocol, lessons learned, and hopes for future climate change efforts","This special issue on Ozone Layer Protection and Climate Change reflects the leadership of the Association of Environmental Studies and Sciences (AESS) in drawing interdisciplinary attention to important environmental issues. The authors are scientists, diplomats, regulatory authorities, environmental activists, and scholars who are intimately involved in actions that protect the stratospheric ozone layer and climate. This issue provides new information and insightful analytic summaries of critical issues in the protection of the atmospheric environment and is also an urgent appeal to professors and students to place atmospheric protection prominently in thinking, research, teaching, and professional activities related to “sustainable development.” The authors describe and document the bold steps taken by individual and institutional leaders involved in the Montreal Protocol to thwart catastrophic ozone layer destruction, which incidentally, albeit on a sound scientific basis, addressed climate change. Because of strong leadership, effective networking, and concepts such the “precautionary principle” and “start and strengthen,” the Montreal Protocol is considered to be the most successful global environmental treaty. For example, thanks to innovative approaches adopted by both industry and government, the Montreal Protocol has already replaced about 85 % of ozone-depleting greenhouse gases with low global warming potential alternatives and increased product energy efficiency. But hardwork is needed to overcome the important challenges that remain, such as the phasedown of the 15 % of alternatives that are high global warming potential hydrofluorocarbons. Scientists, government officials, scholars, and business people must push for higher standards to achieve the combined goals of reducing both ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases.",2015-06-01,10.1007/s13412-015-0224-1,"['Canan, Penelope', 'Andersen, Stephen O.', 'Reichman, Nancy', 'Gareau, Brian']",Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13412-015-0224-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

Many countries have policies designed to stimulate consumer acceptance and accelerate market adoption. In the United States (U.S.), the biggest PEV market, sales have more than tripled since 2011. During the same period, PEV sales have increased, albeit slowly, in most western European countries. Notably, some European countries, such as Norway, showed strong increases mainly owing to generous incentives to PEV consumers. Japan is the second-largest PEV market in terms of number of vehicles sold. The Nissan battery electric vehicle (BEV) Leaf is the top-selling PEV model, with more than 100,000 units sold globally since its launch in 2010. In contrast, after 3 years of policy stimulation, PEV market share in China is still lower than 0.1 % of total car sales, and most of these vehicles were purchased by either central or local governments. However, PEV bus production in China has increased dramatically over last 3 years.

These words may summarize a whole new attitude towards our world and the people who live in it. This paper’s goal is to define an original multi-criteria energy model, named SRIME, specially designed for developing countries. First, an extensive research will be carried out on: energy demand; potential renewable energy, its current know-how and potential future development; potential avoided emissions (CO_2, NO_X, SO_2); and the possible international support versus the in-country possibilities. The precedence constraints will be applied to establish in which degree renewable energy may be substituting for the fossil fuel: the purely economic approach will give way to a sustainable, renewable, development focused energy planning. It must be noted that an innovative function has been specifically included in the SRIME, which evaluates, applying the precedence constraints, the influence renewable energy may have on developing countries rural health and education. Six functions have been established: replaceable amount of fossil energy; CO_2, NO_X and SO_2 avoidable emissions; rural health and education development maximization; and the cost function. These functions will be optimized through the Chebyshev distance ( L _∞) compromise programming minimization, so that the Pareto optimal solution may be obtained.",2015-06-01,10.1007/s40095-015-0164-2,"['Domínguez-Dafauce, Luis Carlos', 'Martín, Francisco Marcos']",International Journal of Energy and Environmental Engineering,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40095-015-0164-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1159,Improved representation of investment decisions in assessments of CO_2 mitigation,"Assessments of emissions mitigation patterns have largely ignored the huge variation in real-world factors—in particular, institutions—that affect where, how and at what costs firms deploy capital^ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . We investigate one such factor—how national institutions affect investment risks and thus the cost of financing^ 6 , 7 , 8 . We use an integrated assessment model (IAM; ref.  9 ) to represent the variation in investment risks across technologies and regions in the electricity generation sector—a pivotally important sector in most assessments of climate change mitigation^ 10 —and compute the impact on the magnitude and distribution of mitigation costs. This modified representation of investment risks has two major effects. First, achieving an emissions mitigation goal is more expensive than it would be in a world with uniform investment risks. Second, industrialized countries mitigate more, and developing countries mitigate less. Here, we introduce a new front in the research on how real-world factors influence climate mitigation. We also suggest that institutional reforms aimed at lowering investment risks could be an important element of cost-effective climate mitigation strategies. Assessments of emissions mitigation patterns have largely ignored differences in investment risk across technologies and regions. With a model accounting for such differences in the electricity generation sector, research now finds that mitigation costs are higher than with no risk variation, and highlights the importance of institutional reforms to lower investment risks.",2015-05-01,10.1038/nclimate2553,"['Iyer, Gokul C.', 'Clarke, Leon E.', 'Edmonds, James A.', 'Flannery, Brian P.', 'Hultman, Nathan E.', 'McJeon, Haewon C.', 'Victor, David G.']",Nature Climate Change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2553.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

The objectives of this study are to estimate the RH surplus in RS and evaluate the feasibility of its use in electricity generation. RH production in RS is estimated at 755 thousand tons per year, which is generated by 230 rice mills. Geographic Information System helped in showing RH’s power capacity for each municipality in RS. This large amount of residue has a potential output of 479.5 MW and 322.7 GWh per year. 43.1 % of this potential comes from 214 mills (93 % of total) whose power plants’ capacity is lower than 800 kW, thus classified as Micro Thermal Power Plants (MTPs). Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the lower the MTP capacity, the more sensitive it is to economic parameters. Furthermore, all MTPs evaluated only showed profitability when Certificates of Emissions Reduction were included, showing the importance of such income.

1161,Footprint methods to separate N_2O emission rates from adjacent paddock areas,"Using micrometeorological techniques to measure greenhouse gas emissions from differently treated adjacent plots is a promising avenue to verify the effect of mitigation strategies at the field scale. In pursuing such an approach, it is crucial to accurately characterize the source area of the fluxes measured at each sampling point. Hence, a comprehensive footprint analysis method is required so that emission rates can be obtained for a specific field within a biochemically heterogeneous area. In this study, a footprint analysis method is developed to estimate the emission for an experiment where the flux of N_2O is measured from several control and treated plots. The emission rate of an individual plot is estimated using an inverse footprint fraction approach where the footprint fractions are obtained from an analytical footprint model. A numerical solution for obtaining the background flux for such a multiplot measurement system is also provided. Results of the footprint analysis method are assessed, first, by comparing footprint fractions obtained from both an analytical footprint model and a “forward” simulation of a backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLs) model; and second, by comparing the emission rates of a control plot obtained from the footprint analysis method and from the “backward” simulation of the bLs model. It is found that the analytical footprint fractions compare well with the values obtained from the bLs model (correlation coefficient of 0.58 and 0.66 within p value <0.001). An average of 4.3 % of the measured fluxes is found to be contributed by sources outside the measured area and, excluding this outside area contribution to the measured flux, footprint corrected emission rates within the defined domain are found to increase by 2.1 to 5.8 % of the measured flux. Also, the proposed method of emission rate estimation is found to work well under a wide range of atmospheric stability.",2015-03-01,10.1007/s00484-014-0844-2,"['Mukherjee, Sandipan', 'McMillan, Andrew M.

1162,The Current Situation and Perspectives on the Use of Renewable Energy Sources for Electricity Generation ,"Deployment of renewable energy sources has been increasing rapidly in recent years. Various types of government policies, the declining cost of many renewable energy technologies, changes in the prices of fossil fuels, an increase in energy demand, among other factors, have encouraged the continuing increase in the use of renewable energy sources for the generation of electricity in several countries from all regions. Despite global financial challenges, renewable energy capacity continued to grow rapidly compared to the cumulative installed capacity from the previous year. In 2013, a total of 25.4 GW of new renewable power capacity was installed. Over 72 % of all new installed capacity in the EU were renewable. It is important to highlight that renewable energy sources are expected to be economically competitive with conventional energy sources for electricity generation in the medium to long-term.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-16083-2_2,"['Morales Pedraza, Jorge']",Electrical Energy Generation in Europe,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-16083-2_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1163,Energy Service Company Development,"ESCOs and the energy market for ESCO financing have been developing since 1976 when oil prices increased dramatically. ESCOs’ services cover projects in many energy areas, including energy extraction, power generation, energy conversion, transportation, power transmission, energy consumption, project financing, energy project audits, monitoring, and energy savings verification. In developing countries, there are many barriers in the energy market that are preventing ESCOs from developing. These barriers include lack of appropriate policy, financial mechanisms, and local capacities for ESCO development and management. Over the past 20 years, the GEF financed 39 ESCO projects in 25 countries and regions to remove these barriers. The results of these projects show that some countries are very successful in ESCO development, but others are not. Different models of ESCOs in different financial markets in various countries are analyzed; case studies are undertaken for China, India, Ukraine, and Brazil. This chapter concludes that while developing financial markets for ESCOs, countries need to consider the following: (1) initiating national government policy to stop energy subsidies and to reform energy pricing, (2) establishing a real, market-based financial mechanism for ESCOs, (3) involving the private sector in project co-financing, (4) creating incentives to ESCOs in the market by investing part of government revenue from energy tax, and (5) incentivizing ESCOs by government corporate tax exemption.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4471-6666-5_9,"['Yang, Ming', 'Yu, Xin']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-6666-5_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1164,Introduction,"Research on human-induced climate change has a long history. The Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius quantified the impact of the infrared absorption capacity of the greenhouse gas CO_2 as early as 1896. He pointed out that cutting its concentration in the earth’s atmosphere by half would produce an ice age, while doubling the concentration would result in a warming of 5–6 °C (Arrhenius 1896). After almost a century of further scientific analysis, the US National Academy of Sciences was asked by the US government administration to assess the scientific basis concerning the projection of possible future climate change resulting from anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. The respective report (Charney et al. 1979) found that a doubling of the earth’s atmospheric CO_2 concentration was associated with a temperature increase of 1.5–4.5 °C, an assessment that has been repeatedly reconfirmed since. The report also concluded, that “it appears that the warming will eventually occur, and the associated regional climatic changes so important to the assessment of socioeconomic consequences may well be significant, but unfortunately the latter cannot yet be adequately projected” (Charney et al. 1979, p. 3).",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-12457-5_1,"['Steininger, Karl W.']",Economic Evaluation of Climate Change Impacts,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-12457-5_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

In this paper, we analysed prevailing key water and nutrient interaction practices namely stone bund, zaï and half-moon techniques in order to explore how their outcomes could be linked to climate change adaptation and mitigation. Data were derived from previous publications but were reinterpreted in the angle of technologies’ alignment with the three pillars of climate-smart agriculture (CSA). We found that the most successful systems are those that provide water, nutrients and a supportive soil structure in a synergistic manner. Indeed, technologies such as zaï , half-moons and stone bunds, combined with an application of organic/inorganic sources of nutrients, are promising climate-smart agricultural practices that could be widely used by smallholder farmers to maintain food production and secure farmers’ livelihoods, while contributing to ecosystem services. However, accompanying incentive measures are needed to empower and capacitate rural farmers to adopt the considered techniques. These are successful examples that can form the basis for informing farmers and agricultural extensionists, as well as future agricultural development plans, policies and investments that pursue sustainable food and nutritional security in the West African Sahel.",2014-11-03,10.1186/2048-7010-3-16,"['Zougmoré, Robert', 'Jalloh, Abdulai', 'Tioro, Andre']",Agriculture & Food Security,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/2048-7010-3-16,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

We found that their projected proximal outcomes for biodiversity and ecosystem service treatments, and approaches to achieve them, are not uniform (e.g., differences in spatial coverage for expecting positive impacts, prioritized REDD+ activities, and expected level of rigor in biodiversity and ecosystem service monitoring). We also found that all four include identification of the priority areas for biodiversity and ecosystem services, plus monitoring and mitigation of the negative impacts of REDD+ activities. These all require substantial time and resources to fully address what the three standards and the instrument actually stipulate. We thus propose options for harmonizing their use to facilitate scaling-up of efforts to strengthen safeguards, from the project level to the national level, while respecting individual national contexts and taking advantage of each standard’s characteristics.",2014-10-01,10.1007/s10310-013-0429-7,"['Ehara, Makoto', 'Hyakumura, Kimihiko', 'Yokota, Yasuhiro']",Journal of Forest Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10310-013-0429-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1167,Ecological analysis of a typical farm-scale biogas plant in China,"The aim of this work was to present the common anaerobic digestion technologies in a typical farm-scale biogas plant in China. The comprehensive benefits of most biogas plants in China have not been fully assessed in past decades due to the limited information of the anaerobic digestion processes in biogas plants. This paper analyzed four key aspects (i.e., operational performance, nonrenewable energy (NE) savings, CO_2 emission reduction (CER) and economic benefits (EBs)) of a typical farm-scale biogas plant, where beef cattle manure was used as feedstock. Owing to the monitoring system, stable operation was achieved with a hydraulic retention time of 18–22 days and a production of 876,000 m^3 of biogas and 37,960 t of digestate fertilizer annually. This could substantially substitute for the nonrenewable energy and chemical fertilizer. The total amount of NE savings and CER derived from biogas and digestate fertilizer was 2.10×10^7 MJ (equivalent to 749.7 tce) and 9.71×10^5 kg, respectively. The EBs of the biogas plant was 6.84×10^5 CNY·yr^−1 with an outputs-to-inputs ratio of 2.37. As a result, the monitoring system was proved to contribute significantly to the sound management and quantitative assessment of the biogas plant. Biogas plants could produce biogas which could be used to substitute fossil fuels and reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases, and digestate fertilizer is also an important bio-product.",2014-09-01,10.1007/s11707-014-0411-5,"['Duan, Na', 'Lin, Cong', 'Wang, Pingzhi', 'Meng, Jing', 'Chen, Hui', 'Li, Xue']",Frontiers of Earth Science,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11707-014-0411-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1168,An integrated framework for linking climate change impacts to emergency adaptation strategies for transport networks,"Introduction The assessment of the impacts of climate change and extreme weather events on transport networks comprises an emerging field, which attracts the interest of several researchers. Most research efforts have concentrated on the identification of adaptation measures and best practices for specific, local events and their impacts. Therefore, the present paper aims to fill in the gap of the current research and methodological activities in linking the impact assessment of climate change to emergency adaptation strategies for transport networks within an aggregated framework and thus linking the problem with its potential solutions. Methods Following a targeted review of the state-of-practice and the relevant literature, a sequential concept for determining the optimal strategies for the relevant authorities is presented, comprised of five distinct dimensions: the extreme events, the area extent where extreme events have an impact on, the transport networks as separate modes, the transport networks as mode-internal components and finally the emergency-adaptation plans. Results Each problem dimension is discussed both autonomously and as part of the sequential concept. A mathematical formulation for the integrated framework is presented, which can be used by any interested entity (e.g. related authorities or organizations). The main theoretical aspects of the framework are also discussed in detail. Conclusions The integrated top-down approach proposed can effectively address all the major dimensions for determining optimal adaptation strategies in a sequential way. The framework can address real world questions and issues about determining the appropriate combination of measures, in order to achieve the minimization of the economic losses due to potential extreme weather events with limited available resources.",2014-06-01,10.1007/s12544-013-0114-0,"['Mitsakis, Evangelos', 'Papanikolaou, Anestis', 'Ayfadopoulou, Georgia', 'Salanova, Josep', 'Doll, Claus', 'Giannopoulos, George', 'Zerefos, Christos']",European Transport Research Review,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12544-013-0114-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1169,Adapting rail and road networks to weather extremes: case studies for southern Germany and Austria,"The assessment of the current impacts of extreme weather conditions on transport systems reveals high costs in specific locations. Prominent examples for Europe are the economic consequences of the harsh winter periods 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 and the floods in Austria, Eastern Europe, Germany and the United Kingdom in 2005 and 2007. Departing from the EC-funded project WEATHER, this paper delves into the subject of adaptation strategies by revisiting the project’s general findings on adaptation strategies and by adding two specific cases: (1) advanced winter maintenance on roads in southwest Germany and (2) technical and organizational measures in Alpine rail transport. For these two cases, feasible adaptation strategies are elaborated and their potential is discussed in light of damage cost forecasts up to 2050. For the road sector, we find a high potential to mitigate weather-related costs, although damages here are expected to decline. In contrast, rail systems face strongly increasing damages and the mitigation options offered by improved information and communication systems seem to be largely exploited. Consequently, it is easier to justify expensive adaptation measures for high-cost rail infrastructures than for road transport. A generic analysis of 14 damage cases worldwide, however, revealed that generally awareness raising, cooperation and communication strategies are sufficient to mitigate the most severe damages by natural disasters.",2014-05-01,10.1007/s11069-013-0969-3,"['Doll, Claus', 'Trinks, Christian', 'Sedlacek, Norbert', 'Pelikan, Verena', 'Comes, Tina', 'Schultmann, Frank']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-013-0969-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1170,Connect the dots: managing the fragmentation of global climate governance,"The debate about post-2012 global climate governance has been framed largely by proponents and opponents of the policymaking process established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In light of the proliferation of institutions governing some aspects of climate change, analysts have asked whether a centralized or a polycentric climate governance architecture will be more effective, efficient, equitable, or viable. While these are valid questions, they obscure the fact that global climate governance is already polycentric, or rather: fragmented. This article argues that the more pertinent questions are how to sensibly link the different elements of global climate governance, and what the role of the UNFCCC could be in this regard. We examine these two questions for three aspects of global climate governance: international climate technology initiatives, emerging emissions trading systems, and unilateral trade measures. The article shows that there are strong arguments for coordination in all of these cases, and illustrates the possible role of the UNFCCC. It concludes, however, that possibilities for coordination will eventually be limited by underlying tensions that will plague any future climate governance architecture.",2014-04-01,10.1007/s10018-013-0060-z,"['Asselt, Harro', 'Zelli, Fariborz']",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10018-013-0060-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1171,Energy efficiency potentials for global climate change mitigation,"Energy efficiency is one of the main options for mitigating climate change. An accurate representation of various mechanisms of energy efficiency is vital for the assessment of its realistic potential. Results of a questionnaire show that the EMF27 models collectively represent known channels of energy efficiency reasonably well, addressing issues of energy efficiency barriers and rebound effects. The majority of models, including general equilibrium models, have an explicit end-use representation for the transportation sector. All participating partial equilibrium models have some capability of reflecting the actual market behavior of consumers and firms. The EMF27 results show that energy intensity declines faster under climate policy than under a baseline scenario. With a climate policy roughly consistent with a global warming of two degrees, the median annual improvement rate of energy intensity for 2010–2030 reaches 2.3 % per year [with a full model range of 1.3–2.9 %/yr], much faster than the historical rate of 1.3 % per year. The improvement rate increases further if technology is constrained. The results suggest that the target of the United Nations’ “Sustainable Energy for All” initiative is consistent with the 2-degree climate change target, as long as there are no technology constraints. The rate of energy intensity decline varies significantly across models, with larger variations at the regional and sectoral levels. Decomposition of the transportation sector down to a service level for a subset of models reveals that to achieve energy efficiency, a general equilibrium model tends to reduce service demands while partial equilibrium models favor technical substitution.",2014-04-01,10.1007/s10584-013-0874-5,"['Sugiyama, Masahiro', 'Akashi, Osamu', 'Wada, Kenichi', 'Kanudia, Amit', 'Li, Jun', 'Weyant, John']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-013-0874-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1172,Modeling adaptation as a flow and stock decision with mitigation,"An effective policy response to climate change will include, among other things, investments in lowering greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation), as well as short-term temporary (flow) and long-lived capital-intensive (stock) adaptation to climate change. A critical near-term question is how investments in reducing climate damages should be allocated across these elements of a climate policy portfolio, especially in the face of uncertainty in both future climate damages and also the effectiveness of yet-untested adaptation efforts. We build on recent efforts in DICE-based integrated assessment modeling approaches that include two types of adaptation—short-lived flow spending and long-lived depreciable adaptation stock investments—along with mitigation, and we identify and explore the uncertainties that impact the relative proportions of policies within a response portfolio. We demonstrate that the relative ratio of flow adaptation, stock adaptation, and mitigation depend critically on interactions among: 1) the relative effectiveness in the baseline of stock versus flow adaptation, 2) the degree of substitutability between stock and flow adaptation types, and 3) whether there exist physical limits on the amount of damages that can be reduced by flow-type adaptation investments. The results indicate where more empirical research on adaptation could focus to best inform near-term policy decisions, and provide a first step towards considering near-term policies that are flexible in the face of uncertainty.",2014-02-01,10.1007/s10584-013-1016-9,"['Felgenhauer, Tyler', 'Webster, Mort']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-013-1016-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1173,Development projects for small rural communities in the Brazilian Amazon region as potential strategies and practices of climate change adaptation,"Climate scenarios for the Amazon region (Brazil) indicate an increase in temperature and a precipitation decrease, affecting society and economic activities, particularly small-scale rural communities. The research aims to identify, describe and evaluate factors present in sustainable development projects for small rural communities (Type- A Demonstration Projects - PDA and Alternatives to Deforestation and Burnt Projects - PADEQ), already implemented, for recognizing its potential use as strategies for adaptation to climate change for small rural communities in the Amazon region. The researches, concerning fifteen projects in Rondonia, Para and Mato Grosso States, were developed through document analysis, technical visits, and interviews with stakeholders of three projects about the community perception, vulnerability and adaptation capacity. The analysis of documents regarding the potential success of the projects highlights their short history, important in the local context, prospects for continuity, and community participation in decision making. Few activities developed in projects could be associated with climate change adaptation practices. Two strategies and practices are the most important: the social organization and the process of awareness and training of the community, and the diversification of the types and forms of agricultural production. The interviews indicate that adaptation is implemented in projects, but without considering the pressures of climate variability and change. While these projects were not planned in the context of climate change, the greatest role of the projects relates to the strengthening of the already existing adaptation capacity, creating good conditions for incorporation of new strategies and adaptation measures, now clearly associated to the objective to reduce the vulnerability to climate change and variability impacts.",2014-02-01,10.1007/s11027-012-9431-1,"['Szlafsztein, Claudio Fabian']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-012-9431-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1174,Abating Climate Change and Feeding the World Through Soil Carbon Sequestration,"Two degrees Celsius was accepted by the Copenhagen Accord and the G-8 Summit as an acceptable upper limit of increase in global temperature. This requires identification and implementation of viable options to reduce emissions of CO_2 and other greenhouse gases and sequester carbon from the atmosphere: business as usual will mean a drastic increase in atmospheric CO_2 with dire consequences for the environment, ecosystem services and human well-being. However, net emissions can be reduced by enhancing terrestrial C pools: the soil (4,000 Pg to 3 m depth) and the biotic (620 Pg). The soil C pool is ~5 times the atmospheric pool (780 Pg) and 6.5 times the biotic pool. Most agroecosystems have severely depleted their soil organic carbon (SOC). The magnitude of depletion (30–40 MgC/ha, i.e. 25–75 % of the antecedent) depends on climate, soil type, land use history, farming systems and management. In the long term, extractive farming practices can severely deplete SOC, exacerbate degradation and adversely affect agronomic productivity. Nonetheless, depleted and degraded soils have a large carbon sink capacity, and the SOC pool can be restored by restorative land use and adoption of management practices that create a positive soil carbon budget, reduce emissions from farming operations like tillage, and minimize risks of soil erosion and nutrient and SOC depletion. These practices include conservation agriculture with mulch farming and cover cropping, complex rotations including agroforestry, integrated nutrient management in conjunction with biological N fixation and recycling of plant nutrients fortified by rhizobial and mycorrhizal inoculations, biochar, fertigation with drip subirrigation, and creating disease-suppressive soils through improvement of rhizospheric processes. The SOC pool should be enhanced to above a threshold level of 1.5–2.0 % in the surface layer of most cultivated soils. Increase in SOC pool in the root zone by 1 Mg/ha can enhance total food production in developing countries by 30–50 million Mg/year. The rate of SOC sequestration in most cropland soils ranges from 100 to 1,000 kgC/ha/year with a total global sequestration potential of 0.4–1.2 PgC over 50–100 years. The potential of C sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere is estimated to be equivalent to a drawdown of 50 ppm of atmospheric CO_2 over a century.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-6187-2_47,"['Lal, R.']",Soil as World Heritage,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-6187-2_47,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

We expect a huge impact on biomass yield, quality, and conversion efficiency with appropriate plant breeding and biotechnology tools in order to develop energy sorghum germplasm that allows highly efficient production of biofuel. The outlined improvement should produce benefits that include: (1) genetic improvement of a biomass crop with significantly reduced overall cost of biomass-to-ethanol conversion; (2) selection of a reliable bioenergy feedstock that is drought tolerant, inexpensive to grow, environmentally friendly and cultivated in nearly all temperate and tropical climate regions; (3) expansion of the production area for bioenergy crops by developing cold tolerance germplasm and hybrids and by offering both annual and perennial sweet sorghum types; and (4) reduction in cell wall lignin for improved efficiency in production of biofuels.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-9329-7_6,"['Damasceno, Cynthia M.

1177,"Climate change mitigation strategies in agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors in Vietnam","Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sectors account for 53 % of the domestic greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in Vietnam in 2000. However, due to political focus on adaptation, Vietnamese government has not formulated particular policy on mitigation in the sectors. This study aims to identify and assess mitigation potential in AFOLU sectors in Vietnam up to 2030 using AFOLU Bottom-up model. Therefore, the results can help government towards building mitigation strategies in the country. The methodology involves: (1) development of future assumptions of crops harvested areas, livestock population and area of land use and land use change and (2) identification of mitigation countermeasures with high potential and assessment of their cost-effectiveness. In 2030, 11 MtCO_2eq/year of emission can be reduced by no-regret countermeasures which take zero or negative cost. In the case of full application of countermeasures, 48 MtCO_2eq/year can be reduced compared to the baseline emission level. Mitigation countermeasures, which have great contribution for GHG reduction in Vietnam, are midseason drainage in rice paddy (7 MtCO_2eq/year), off-season incorporation of rice straw (3 MtCO_2eq/year) and conservation of existing protection forests (17 MtCO_2eq/year). Based on our findings, a package of mitigation countermeasures at 10 USD/tCO_2eq is expected to have the most economic efficiency and high mitigation for GHG mitigation in AFOLU sectors in Vietnam.",2014-01-01,10.1007/s11027-012-9424-0,"['Hoa, Nguyen Thai', 'Hasegawa, Tomoko', 'Matsuoka, Yuzuru']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-012-9424-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

This is particularly the case for climate change adaptation, which—given the interwoven processes of climate change—involves a wide range of actors and sectors. This chapter discusses the overall need for participatory adaptation planning, exemplifying it with the process to develop a Regional Climate Change Adaptation Plan for Santiago de Chile. The experience highlights the most significant lessons learned, including the challenges and constraints that emerged during the process. The chapter stresses the use of a multi-stakeholder, inter-sectoral planning approach that involved the organization of ten roundtable meetings in Santiago de Chile over a period of two and a half years. Political legitimacy was provided by the two principal institutions responsible for climate change planning at city-regional level.

1182,Climate Change and Its Effects on Atoll Island States,"Anthropogenic climate change could have disastrous consequences for the survival of atolls around the planet. Although atolls have survived past increases in sea levels through the upward growth of corals, future increases in coral mortality due to raising sea temperatures and ocean acidification will probably mean that coral islands will suffer increasing erosion till they eventually disappear. Geomorphological change is unlikely to be linear with most of the change occurring due to high intensity episodic events. Potential future increases in tropical cyclone intensities due to rising sea temperatures are also likely to increase the pace of coastal erosion, further compounding the problem. While a number of adaptation measures are possible, ultimately the only definite path to ensure that islands can survive the death of corals is through the construction of coastal defences, which will become progressively more expensive as the depth of water in front of them continues to increase.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-38186-7_3,"['Yamamoto, Lilian', 'Esteban, Miguel']",Atoll Island States and International Law,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-38186-7_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1183,Ecological Intensification for Crop Protection,"We need to break away from intensive agriculture based on non-renewable and toxic inputs. Safer practices are indeed emerging. Sustainable agriculture started about 50 years ago with the design of integrated pest management (IPM) to counteract pesticide misuse and abuse. Ecological intensification emerged only a few years ago. Here we review the literature to compare ecological intensification and IPM, from the point of view of crop protection. We present also agroecology and organic farming. Neither ecological intensification nor IPM have philosophical bases such as agroecology, or to an even larger extent, biodynamic agriculture. Ecological intensification, IPM and agroecology are polysemous, flexible and pragmatic approaches, whereas organic farming is well-defined by its scope and standards. Ecological intensification, in explicitly pursuing the goal of increasing food production to feed the planet, differs from agroecology, whose proponents think that the view that world hunger will be solved by merely increasing yield is an oversimplification. In terms of cropping system design, in its actual practice, IPM often remains based on methods that increase the efficiency of chemical pesticide use. Or, along with organic agriculture, it may remain based on substitution of pesticides by less harmful alternatives. In contrast, ecologically intensive crop protection usually requires cropping system redesign. In terms of ecosystem service provision, IPM tends to focus on the pest-pathogen regulation service. In contrast, both ecological intensification and agroecology pay attention to both practices which were designed for crop protection and biomass provision purposes, as well as practices with broader scope, primarily designed to offer other ecosystem services which are found to have indirect effects on crop protection. This chapter also describes selected tropical case studies of crop protection, such as upland rice seed-dressing and fruit fly control in orchards, to compare and contrast crop protection in these contexts. Finally, we propose to consider IPM and ecologically intensive crop protection as complementary rather than conflicting approaches. The concept of “ultimate IPM” brings IPM closer to ecologically intensive crop protection. This new approach involves starting from a nearly natural ecosystem to which inputs are gradually added when absolutely necessary, rather than starting from a conventional agroecosystem and gradually remove inputs from it.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-06016-3_3,"['Ratnadass, Alain', 'Barzman, Marco']",Sustainable Agriculture Reviews 14,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-06016-3_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

In this paper, low-carbon energy planning practices of several new districts are summarized and a general theoretical and practical framework for district energy planning is proposed. In addition, six key points of concern in the planning process are identified. These include low-carbon estimation and index control, overall planning of infrastructure, linkage between city planning and other special low-carbon eco-planning, investment and financing and operation modes, planning management mechanisms, and the construction of a growing energy system which is combined with a project schedule.

1185,Climate Change Impacts on the Energy Sector and Adaptation Options,"This chapter demonstrates the future impacts of climate change on the energy sector in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile (MRS) and develops measures to reduce problems ahead. The investigation is based firstly on an overview of recent energy supply and demand in the MRS. Existing data taken from the literature and interviews indicates that only a small amount of the energy consumed in the MRS is produced on its territory. Secondly, this chapter makes use of a description of the framework scenarios outlined in Chap. 3, where two quantitative scenarios for the supply and demand of energy were created for the MRS. Both scenarios see an increase in the consumption and supply of energy. Thirdly, a calculation was made for the future influence of climate change on the energy supply and demand. Using a methodology of fixed correlations between rising temperatures and energy consumption, it indicates that climate change will have a relatively low impact on energy supply and demand. So dependence of the MRS on energy imports is expected to rise even further in the future. Four measures were designed for implementation in the MRS as a response to future problems.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-39103-3_5,"['Stelzer, Volker', 'Quintero, Adriana']",Climate Adaptation Santiago,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-39103-3_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1186,The long-term policy context for solar radiation management,"We examine the potential role of “solar radiation management” or “sunlight reduction methods” (SRM) in limiting future climate change, focusing on the interplay between SRM deployment and mitigation in the context of uncertainty in climate response. We use a straightforward scenario analysis to show that the policy and physical context determine the potential need, amount, and timing of SRM. SRM techniques, along with a substantial emission reduction policy, would be needed to meet stated policy goals, such as limiting climate change to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, if the climate sensitivity is high. The SRM levels examined by current modeling studies are much higher than the levels required under an assumption of a consistent long-term policy. We introduce a degree-year metric, which quantifies the magnitude of SRM that would be needed to keep global temperatures under a given threshold.",2013-12-01,10.1007/s10584-012-0577-3,"['Smith, Steven J.', 'Rasch, Philip J.']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-012-0577-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

Adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices entails defining sustainability, developing easily measured indicators of sustainability, moving toward integrated agricultural systems, and offering incentives or imposing regulations to affect farmer behavior. Landscape ecology is an informative discipline in considering sustainability because it provides theory and methods for dealing with spatial heterogeneity, scaling, integration, and complexity. To move toward more sustainable agriculture, we propose adopting a systems perspective, recognizing spatial heterogeneity, integrating landscape-design principles and addressing the influences of context, such as the particular products and their distribution, policy background, stakeholder values, location, temporal influences, spatial scale, and baseline conditions. Topics that need further attention at local and regional scales include (1) protocols for quantifying material and energy flows; (2) standard specifications for management practices and corresponding effects; (3) incentives and disincentives for enhancing economic, environmental, and social conditions (including financial, regulatory and other behavioral motivations); (4) integrated landscape planning and management; (5) monitoring and assessment; (6) effects of societal demand; and (7) integrative policies for promoting agricultural sustainability.",2013-07-01,10.1007/s10980-012-9814-4,"['Dale, Virginia H.', 'Kline, Keith L.', 'Kaffka, Stephen R.', 'Langeveld, J.

1188,Which crop production system is more efficient in energy use: wheat or barley?,"Efficient use of energy helps to achieve increased production and productivity and contributes to the economy, profitability, and competitiveness of agricultural sustainability of rural communities. Evaluation of wheat and barley production systems in view of energy balance was conducted in Khorasan Razavi Province, Iran. Data were collected by using a face-to-face questionnaire from wheat and barley fields in 2011. Results revealed that total energy input for wheat was 51,040 MJ ha^−1 and for barley 44,866; in wheat and barley systems, renewable energy was consumed by 25.43 and 23.53 %, while non-renewable energy was consumed by 74.57 and 76.47 %, respectively. Energy use efficiency, energy productivity, and net energy were 1.7 kg MJ^−1, 0.088 kg MJ^−1, and 35,987 MJ ha^−1 in wheat system and 1.83 kg MJ^−1, 0.092 kg MJ^−1, and 33,833 MJ ha^−1 in barley system, respectively. Energy intensiveness in wheat fields (61.84 MJ $^−1) was higher than in barley fields (58.71 MJ $^−1). Also, benefit-to-cost ratio in wheat system (1.59) was higher than in barley system (1.35).

1189,Functional convergence in water use of trees from different geographical regions: a meta-analysis,"Functional convergence in water use of trees across species from diverse geographic locations was examined using data on tree water use parameters, with the intention of gaining an understanding on the capacity for water transport for trees with varying structural and functional traits. Wood density (ρ_w), which is reported to have a negative exponential relation with sap flow density (SFD), showed a bell-shaped curve when the daily SFD data from 101 tree species belonging to 35 angiosperm and gymnosperm families were plotted. The species came from 23 different geographical locations representing all continents. Trees were most efficient in water transport when the ρ_w was between 0.51 and 0.65 g cm^−3. When the ρ_w increased or decreased from this range, there was a gradual fall in their water transport rate as indicated by lower daily SFD. The unexpected reduction in SFD with decreasing ρ_w is explained in terms of reduced conductance in the transport pathway, which is a precaution taken by the tree for avoiding cavitation or implosion in larger conducting tubes, which is characteristic of low density wood. The development of severe leaf water potential variations, which is frequently reported in such trees, supports this notion. The SFD versus ρ_w relation has a potentially wide applicability in predicting water use by forest stands with varying ρ_w. In addition, the occurrence of a high number of tree species with ρ_w values in the range of 0.51–0.65 g cm^−3 across all continents examined points towards the importance of ρ_w in the evolutionary process as related to efficient functioning of the water transport mechanism.",2013-06-01,10.1007/s00468-012-0834-0,"['Kallarackal, Jose', 'Otieno, Dennis O.', 'Reineking, Björn', 'Jung, Eun-Young', 'Schmidt, Mark W.

1190,Bottom–Up Energy Analysis System (BUENAS)—an international appliance efficiency policy tool,"The Bottom–Up Energy Analysis System (BUENAS) calculates potential energy and greenhouse gas emission impacts of efficiency policies for lighting, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, appliances, and industrial equipment through 2030. The model includes 16 end use categories and covers 11 individual countries plus the European Union. BUENAS is a bottom–up stock accounting model that predicts energy consumption for each type of equipment in each country according to engineering-based estimates of annual unit energy consumption, scaled by projections of equipment stock. Energy demand in each scenario is determined by equipment stock, usage, intensity, and efficiency. When available, BUENAS uses sales forecasts taken from country studies to project equipment stock. Otherwise, BUENAS uses an econometric model of household appliance uptake developed by the authors. Once the business as usual scenario is established, a high-efficiency policy scenario is constructed that includes an improvement in the efficiency of equipment installed in 2015 or later. Policy case efficiency targets represent current “best practice” and include standards already established in a major economy or well-defined levels known to enjoy a significant market share in a major economy. BUENAS calculates energy savings according to the difference in energy demand in the two scenarios. Greenhouse gas emission mitigation is then calculated using a forecast of electricity carbon factor. We find that mitigation of 1075 mt annual CO_2 emissions is possible by 2030 from adopting current best practices of appliance efficiency policies.

1191,2020 emissions levels required to limit warming to below 2 °C,"A relatively wide range of emissions in 2020 could keep open the option of limiting long-term temperature increase to below 2 °C; however, a shortfall in critical technologies would narrow that range or eliminate it altogether. Reduced emissions in 2020 would hedge against this uncertainty. This paper presents a systematic scenario analysis of how different levels of short-term 2020 emissions would impact the technological and economic feasibility of achieving the 2 °C target in the long term. We find that although a relatively wide range of emissions in 2020—from 41 to 55 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO_2e yr^−1)—may preserve the option of meeting a 2 °C target, the size of this ‘feasibility window’ strongly depends on the prospects of key energy technologies, and in particular on the effectiveness of efficiency measures to limit the growth of energy demand. A shortfall of critical technologies—either for technological or socio-political reasons—would narrow the feasibility window, if not close it entirely. Targeting lower 2020 emissions levels of 41–47 Gt CO_2e yr^−1 would allow the 2 °C target to be achieved under a wide range of assumptions, and thus help to hedge against the risks of long-term uncertainties.",2013-04-01,10.1038/nclimate1758,"['Rogelj, Joeri', 'McCollum, David L.', 'O’Neill, Brian C.', 'Riahi, Keywan']",Nature Climate Change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1758.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1192,"Agriculture and greenhouse gases, a common tragedy. A review","Increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases has led to global warming and associated climatic changes. The problem has been aggravated by the perception that the atmosphere is an infinite and toll-free resource. The well-known concept proposed by Garrett Hardin—“The Tragedy of the Commons”—highlights the misuse of common resources, which ultimately lead to their depletion. This article emphasizes the relevance of the same concept to the current climatic changes and highlights the impact of agriculture on the environment. The specific focus is on field crop production and livestock husbandry that have resulted in deteriorating environmental services and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, the total amount of energy consumed by these sectors is enormous, encompassing 11 exajoules (EJ) annually. In addition, the article highlights possible impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity. Considering the foreseen growth of the global human population, it is expected that additional pressures will aggravate natural environments. Adoption of recommended management practices is crucial to reverse the environmental footprint of agriculture and lessen its impact on climate change. Regarding croplands, these practices can include reduced tillage systems, crop residue management, improved management of nutrients and pests, cover cropping, agroforestry, biochar application as soil amendment, and utilization of precision agriculture technologies. In the livestock sector, recommended management practices include changes in animals’ diet and appropriate management of manure. Adoption of these practices is also expected to decrease the on-farm and off-farm energy use. To encourage the adoption of these practices, authorities should provide the farmers with incentives, such as payments for improving environmental services. Also, international regulations must be enforced to instigate a notable shift in human diets with the goal of reducing the environmental impact of food production. Judicious implementation of related policies would be crucial for promoting the required links between agricultural production and environmental sustainability.",2013-04-01,10.1007/s13593-012-0110-0,"['Stavi, Ilan', 'Lal, Rattan']",Agronomy for Sustainable Development,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13593-012-0110-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1193,Reduction targets and abatement costs of developing countries resulting from global and developed countries’ reduction targets by 2050,"The European Union (EU) has advocated an emission reduction target for developed countries of 80% to 95% below the 1990 level by 2050, and a global reduction target of 50%. Developing countries have resisted the inclusion of these targets in both the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Copenhagen Accord and Cancún Agreements. This paper analyses what these targets would imply for emission targets, abatement costs and energy consumption of developing countries, taking into account the conditional emission reduction pledges for 2020. An 80% reduction target for developed countries would imply more stringent per capita emission targets for developing countries than developed countries by 2050. Moreover, abatement costs of developing countries would be higher than those of developed countries. An 85% to 90% reduction target for developed countries would result in similar per capita emission targets and abatement costs for developed and developing countries by 2050. Total reduction targets for developing countries would range from 30% to 40% below 2005 levels by 2050 and from 30% to 35% above 2005 levels by 2030. The 2030 target for China would be 40% to 45% above 2005 levels, compared to a target for the EU of 45% to 50% below 1990 and for the United States of America (USA) 30% to 35% below 1990. Emission target trajectories for Brazil, South Africa and China would peak before 2025 and for India by around 2025. From the analysis, we may conclude that from the viewpoint of developing countries either developed countries increase their target above 85%, and/or make substantial side-payments.",2013-04-01,10.1007/s11027-012-9371-9,"['Elzen, Michel G.

1194,Sustainable bioenergy production from marginal lands in the US Midwest,"Legislation on biofuels production in the USA^ 1 and Europe^ 2 , 3 is directing food crops towards the production of grain-based ethanol^ 2 , 3 , which can have detrimental consequences for soil carbon sequestration^ 4 , nitrous oxide emissions^ 5 , nitrate pollution^ 6 , biodiversity^ 7 and human health^ 8 . An alternative is to grow lignocellulosic (cellulosic) crops on ‘marginal’ lands^ 9 . Cellulosic feedstocks can have positive environmental outcomes^ 10 , 11 and could make up a substantial proportion of future energy portfolios^ 12 , 13 . However, the availability of marginal lands for cellulosic feedstock production, and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, remains uncertain. Here we evaluate the potential for marginal lands in ten Midwestern US states to produce sizeable amounts of biomass and concurrently mitigate GHG emissions. In a comparative assessment of six alternative cropping systems over 20 years, we found that successional herbaceous vegetation, once well established, has a direct GHG emissions mitigation capacity that rivals that of purpose-grown crops (−851 ± 46 grams of CO_2 equivalent emissions per square metre per year (gCO_2e m^−2 yr^−1)). If fertilized, these communities have the capacity to produce about 63 ± 5 gigajoules of ethanol energy per hectare per year. By contrast, an adjacent, no-till corn–soybean–wheat rotation produces on average 41 ± 1 gigajoules of biofuel energy per hectare per year and has a net direct mitigation capacity of −397 ± 32 gCO_2e m^−2 yr^−1; a continuous corn rotation would probably produce about 62 ± 7 gigajoules of biofuel energy per hectare per year, with 13% less mitigation. We also perform quantitative modelling of successional vegetation on marginal lands in the region at a resolution of 0.4 hectares, constrained by the requirement that each modelled location be within 80 kilometres of a potential biorefinery. Our results suggest that such vegetation could produce about 21 gigalitres of ethanol per year from around 11 million hectares, or approximately 25 per cent of the 2022 target for cellulosic biofuel mandated by the US Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, with no initial carbon debt nor the indirect land-use costs associated with food-based biofuels. Other regional-scale aspects of biofuel sustainability^ 2 , such as water quality^ 11 , 14 and biodiversity^ 15 , await future study. A comparative assessment of six alternative cropping systems over 20 years shows that, once well established, successional herbaceous vegetation grown on marginal lands has a direct greenhouse gas emissions mitigation capacity that rivals that of purpose-grown crops. Productive agricultural land that could otherwise be used to produce much-needed food crops is being diverted towards grain-based ethanol production in both Europe and the United States, partly in response to government legislation. An alternative is to grow cellulosic crops on so-called marginal lands. An evaluation of the potential of marginal lands in the Midwestern United States to produce biofuel while mitigating direct greenhouse gas emissions now finds that they have the capacity to produce a significant amount of biofuel energy without the initial carbon debt and indirect land-use costs associated with food-based biofuels.",2013-01-24,10.1038/nature11811,"['Gelfand, Ilya', 'Sahajpal, Ritvik', 'Zhang, Xuesong', 'Izaurralde, R.

1195,Life-Cycle Environmental Impacts of Biofuels and Co-products,"Issues of energy independence and security, global climate change, and the depletion of fossil resources drive research into biofuels and bioproducts. While emerging biofuels and biorefineries pursue lower carbon transportation fuels, careful consideration of a wide range of potential environmental impacts is necessary to avoid unintended consequences. These concerns can be addressed by holistic life-cycle evaluation of bioenergy/biofuel supply chains from raw materials acquisition, to fuel conversion and end use. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a promising tool for assessing the environmental sustainability of these biofuels. This chapter discusses current biofeedstocks and fuels, introduces the methodological framework of LCA, and explores challenges, critiques, benefits, and applications of LCA in evaluating the environmental performance and sustainability of emergent biofuels and co-product systems. An analysis of algal biodiesel production is presented as a case study, and the broader implications and potential of LCA to inform decision making are explored.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-34519-7_18,"['Zaimes, Gregory', 'Borkowski, Matthew', 'Khanna, Vikas']",Biofuel Technologies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-34519-7_18,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1196,A Comparison of Life Cycle Assessment Studies of Different Biofuels,"The intensive increase of biofuel demand has pushed the researchers to find a sustainable biofuel production system. LCA is the most accepted tool to assess the sustainability of biofuel production systems. The functional unit, scope, system boundary, reference system, data source, and allocation are the most important steps of an LCA study. Variations in these steps between studies affect the results significantly. Previous studies have shown that different biofuel feedstocks have different environmental burden hot spots, which refer to elevated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with a specific life cycle stage or facility process. The present chapter is an effort to compare various LCA studies on different biofuels. The well-to-wheel (cradle-to-grave) system is recommended for the assessment of biofuels production system. An LCA study of biofuels can demonstrate their sustainability and can guide the policy makers in adopting the policies for their promotions.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4471-5364-1_12,"['Rathore, Dheeraj', 'Pant, Deepak', 'Singh, Anoop']",Life Cycle Assessment of Renewable Energy Sources,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-5364-1_12,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1198,Land Use and Land Management Effects on Nitrous Oxide Fluxes,"The terrestrial ecosystems are the major source of N_2O contributing about 65% of global emissions. Agricultural activities are the most important anthropogenic N_2O emissions, accounting for 60–80% of the anthropogenic N_2O sources, mostly as N inputs to agricultural soils. Estimates of N_2O emissions from various agricultural systems vary widely due to variations in climatic and environmental factors, soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, soil texture, soil drainage, abundance of NO_3-N, soil pH, management practices, and crop type. Under managed pasture soils, N_2O is mainly generated from mineral N originating from urine, dung, and biologically fixed N. Fluxes of N_2O from grazed pastures are also highly variable due to patchiness of animal excreta. In grassland ecosystems, significant N_2O emissions could occur from the accumulation of mainly nitrate-N following mineralization of organic N from legume-based pastures. Tropical savannas contribute N_2O emissions from grazing animals and frequent fires. Unfertilized forestry systems may emit less but the fertilized plantations emit more N_2O than the extensive grazed pastures. Overall, there is a need to examine the emission factors used for estimating N_2O emissions. The ratio of N_2O:N_2 production depends on oxygen supply or water-filled pore space, decomposable organic carbon, N substrate supply, temperature, and pH and salinity. N_2O production from soil is sporadic both in time and space, and therefore, it is a challenge to scale up the measurements of N_2O emission from a given location and time to regional and national levels.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5364-8_6,"['Ussiri, David', 'Lal, Rattan']",Soil Emission of Nitrous Oxide and its Mitigation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5364-8_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1199,Mitigation Options for Livestock and Pasture Lands,"Nitrous oxide emissions from grazed pastures represent a significant source of atmospheric N_2O. Wastes from animal production systems contribute as much as 30–50% to the global N_2O emissions from agriculture. Improved understanding of sources and N transformation processes, and soil and climatic conditions controlling N_2O emissions under livestock production system helps in identifying management options to reduce N_2O emissions from grazed pasture systems. The mitigation options for livestock production systems includes optimum soil and grazing land management, limiting the amount of N fertilizer or effluent applied when soil is wet, animals dietary management to decrease the amount of N excreted in animal urine through feeding low-N feed supplements as an alternative to fertilizer N boosted grass. In addition, plant and animal selection for increased N use efficiency, using N transformation inhibitors to control urea to ammonium and ammonium to nitrate conversions in soil, as well as use of stand-off/feed pads or housing systems during high-risk periods of N loss are important strategies to minimize N_2O emissions from livestock system. The use of single or multiple mitigation options always needs to be evaluated in a whole farm system context and accounting for total greenhouse gas emissions including methane and carbon dioxide. Whole-system life-cycle-based environmental analysis should also be conducted to assess overall environmental emissions associated the N_2O mitigation options. The overall focus should be ensuring tighter N cycling and increasing N use efficiency through decreasing N losses per unit of animal production.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5364-8_9,"['Ussiri, David', 'Lal, Rattan']",Soil Emission of Nitrous Oxide and its Mitigation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5364-8_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1201,Conceptualising Climate Change Governance,"The projected impacts of climate change, not only flooding and the urban heat island, but also gradual changes, such as biodiversity loss or a reduction in the groundwater level, can become societal problems. The complex inter-relationships between stakeholders and societal coordination can be included under the term “governance”. The attributes of climate change governance will be outlined in this chapter. Attention is focused on societal scopes for designing and regulating climate change. Firstly, the specific demands for climate change governance are presented. Subsequently, the term governance is introduced, together with its various applications, and the different approaches and concepts regarding climate change governance are discussed. The conceptualisation of climate change governance is based on this spectrum. As this paper discusses, climate change governance is not an entirely new concept, but one that has many parallels with existing models for governance in other settings. Nevertheless, a re-evaluation of its role in this context still appears reasonable since climate change-related measures are characterised by specific features requiring their own regulatory framework. This includes the cooperation of different institutions and actors in addition to hierarchical forms of regulation, and describes the development of self-organising structures. Climate change governance can therefore be described as a broad range of options of coordination concerning climate change adaptation and mitigation.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-29831-8_2,"['Fröhlich, Jannes', 'Knieling, Jörg']",Climate Change Governance,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-29831-8_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1202,Environmental Aspects of Kenaf Production and Use,"This chapter outlines the environmental aspects of kenaf production and utilization, focusing on the impact on biotic and abiotic resources, through the analysis of the crop’s interaction with its environment and management practices. In this study, the assessment of data retrieved from literature was supplemented with results obtained from the Biokenaf project. As a bioenergy and biomaterials carrier, kenaf offers ecological advantages over fossil sources by contributing to reduction of greenhouse gases and energy savings. Nevertheless, a negative impact may be perceived in terms of acidifying emissions. Although the different indicators did not yield a common pattern, overall results suggest that kenaf crop have an advantage over other annual energy crop systems, namely regarding pesticides and fertilizers inputs. However, risks associated with soil quality, erodibility, use of resources, and biodiversity are equivalent to most annual energy crops. Crop management options can influence the outcomes, but site specific factors should be accurately assessed to evaluate the adequacy between crop and location.

South-eastern Mediterranean countries differ significantly in their demographic and economic development and projected climatic changes – in particular aridification – from northern Mediterranean countries, making them generally more vulnerable. Climate change is but one driver of change in the Mediterranean, which interacts with other drivers such as land use change, urbanization, tourism, globalization etc. In combination, these drivers cause increasing pressure and often land and natural resource degradation, most prominently desertification in the south-eastern Mediterranean.

1204,Climate Change Expectations in the Next Half Century of Turkey,"Turkey as one of the mid-latitude countries in sub-tropical climate belt of the world has a special location meteoro-hydrologically. Various air mass movements display their impacts over Turkey’s air, weather, and climate situations on a daily, monthly, or yearly base. Such a meteorologically interactive region is expected to have climate change signature variations as a result of various air movements in the future. A set of values from over three decades of observed temperatures, records from two overlapping periods 1960–1990 and 1970–2000 based on the records from the 30 years in the past, are taken. The basic time duration between 1960 and 1990 displays the actions as observed in the regular time period in the world. This time is considered as a base to determine the state of future temp changes. This study avoids statistical comparisons based on arithmetic averages and standard deviations; instead it adopts a method of interpreting the changes over the last three decades based on Special Report on Emissions Scenarios for different time intervals (5-, 10-, and 50-year). In this work, after establishing a special downscaling methodology, different General Climate Model results are coupled with local variables and following the verification and validation with measured data from almost 300 spatially distributed monthly temperature data, the significance of climate change impact is presented with relevant interpretations. The above explanations note that the greatest change in the last 40 years in terms of temperature is more visible in the highest temperatures rather than the average and lowest temperatures. Generally speaking, because the highest heats are observed in summer times (less rainfall month), one may conclude that there is rise in the number of drought incidents in these times in Istanbul and different cities of Turkey.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-7588-0_6,"['Sirdas, Sevinc', 'Şen, Zekâi', 'Öztopal, Ahmet']","Causes, Impacts and Solutions to Global Warming",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-7588-0_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1206,New Insights from the BIOKENAF Project,"This chapter summarizes the most important achievements of the European research project entitled “BIOKENAF—Biomass Production Chain and Growth Simulation Model for Kenaf” ( www.cres.gr/biokenaf ) that carried out for 2003–2007. The overall objective of the BIOKENAF project was to introduce and evaluate kenaf as a non-food crop through an integrated approach for alternative land use in South EU that will provide diversified opportunities for farmers and biological materials for the “bio-based industries” of the future. Several fields’ trials were carried out in South EU aiming to identify the appropriate crop management for yields maximization (sowing dates, plant densities, best varieties, irrigation and fertilization needs, harvesting time). A dynamic crop-growth simulation model was developed to produce quantitative estimates of the yielding potential of kenaf at regional level. The model was based on the detailed crop data that were collected from the field trials and were included in photosynthetic capacity, respiratory losses, phenology, dry matter distribution, and data on leaf area. The appropriate harvesting time for south EU countries that ensure the highest possible yields with the lowest possible moisture content investigated as well as best storage method in order to the minimum losses in the quality and quantity of the feedstock to be achieved. The suitability of kenaf for both selected industrial products (composites, building materials, nonwovens, paper, and board and absorption particles) and for thermo-chemical energy applications (combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis) was investigated. Following an environmental/economic assessment and market studies insight in the feasibility of kenaf for industrial and energy applications was provided that was used not only for comparison of the crop with other conventional crops with similar cultural practices but also for the development of scenarios for alternative land use and diversified opportunities for farmers in order to produce industrial bio-products that will supply the “bio-based industries” of the future.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4471-5067-1_8,"['Alexopoulou, E.', 'Cosentino, S.

1208,Energy budget and economic analysis in conventional and organic rice production systems and organic scenarios in the transition period in Iran,"Compared to conventional agriculture, organic agriculture is reported to be more efficient and effective in reducing water and soil pollution, greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission and risk of human health. In additional, field management under organic condition can be useful for increasing energy efficiency. Rice is one of the important crops which are cultivated in two forms, organic and conventional, in Iran. In order to compare the energy efficiency and economic analysis of rice production in organic and conventional systems in Iran, needed information was collected by face-to-face questionnaire in 2011 and three scenarios were designed to predict the changes of energy budget and economic analysis in the transition period that included: 25%, 50% and 75% organic management in rice production. The results showed that all energy indexes were improved in organic rice production compared to conventional condition. Higher values of benefit to cost ratio, gross and net return and lower value of total cost of production were obtained from organic rice production which indicated that the organic management of farm improved economically in comparison with the conventional rice production system. The shares of direct and renewable energies were increased by approach to organic management. Increase in energy efficiency and productivity was predicted for the transition period but decrease trend in economic indexes was projected for this period in all scenarios. The main reason for decreasing economic indexes in organic scenarios was that the market price of organic rice was the same as that of conventional rice in the transition period.",2012-12-01,10.1007/s11708-012-0206-x,"['Mansoori, Hamed', 'Moghaddam, Parviz Rezvani', 'Moradi, Rooholla']",Frontiers in Energy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11708-012-0206-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1209,Evaluating Local Crop Residue Biomass Supply: Economic and Environmental Impacts,"The increasing interest in energy production from biomass requires a better understanding of potential local production and environmental impacts. This information is needed by local producers, biomass industry, and other stakeholders, and for larger scale analyses. This study models biomass production decisions at the field level using a case example of a biomass gasification facility constructed at the University of Minnesota—Morris (UMM). This institutional-scale application has an anticipated feedstock demand of about 8,000 Mg year^−1. The model includes spatial impacts due to sub-field variation in soil characteristics and transportation costs. Results show that the amount of biomass producers could profitably supply within a 32.2-km radius of UMM increases as plant-gate biomass price increases from $59 to $84 Mg^−1, with 588,000 Mg annual biomass supply at $84 Mg^−1. Results also show that the most profitable tillage and crop rotation practices shift in response to increasing biomass price with producers shifting from a corn-soybean rotation toward continuous corn. While biomass harvest is conducive to increased soil erosion rates and reduced soil organic carbon levels, changes in crop production practices are shown to at least partially offset these impacts. Transportation costs tend to concentrate and intensify biomass production near the biomass facility, which also tends to concentrate environmental impacts near the facility.",2012-09-01,10.1007/s12155-012-9178-2,"['Archer, David W.', 'Johnson, Jane M.

1210,Quality of geological CO_2 storage to avoid jeopardizing climate targets,"We explore allowable leakage for carbon capture and geological storage to be consistent with maximum global warming targets of 2.5 and 3 °C by 2100. Given plausible fossil fuel use and carbon capture and storage scenarios, and based on modeling of time-dependent leakage of CO_2, we employ a climate model to calculate the long-term temperature response of CO_2 emissions. We assume that half of the stored CO_2 is permanently trapped by fast mechanisms. If 40 % of global CO_2 emissions are stored in the second half of this century, the temperature effect of escaped CO_2 is too small to compromise a 2.5 °C target. If 80 % of CO_2 is captured, escaped CO_2 must peak 300 years or later for consistency with this climate target. Due to much more CO_2 stored for the 3 than the 2.5 °C target, quality of storage becomes more important. Thus for the 3 °C target escaped CO_2 must peak 400 years or later in the 40 % scenario, and 3000 years or later in the 80 % scenario. Consequently CO_2 escaped from geological storage can compromise the less stringent 3 °C target in the long-run if most of global CO_2 emissions have been stored. If less CO_2 is stored only a very high escape scenario can compromise the more stringent 2.5 °C target. For the two remaining combinations of storage scenarios and climate targets, leakage must be high to compromise these climate targets.",2012-09-01,10.1007/s10584-012-0447-z,"['Torvanger, Asbjørn', 'Grimstad, Alv-Arne', 'Lindeberg, Erik', 'Rive, Nathan', 'Rypdal, Kristin', 'Skeie, Ragnhild Bieltvedt', 'Fuglestvedt, Jan', 'Tollefsen, Petter']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-012-0447-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1211,Willingness to pay and political support for a US national clean energy standard,"In 2010 and 2011, Republicans and Democrats proposed mandating clean power generation in the electricity sector^ 1 , 2 , 3 . To evaluate public support for a national clean energy standard (NCES), we conducted a nationally representative survey that included randomized treatments on the sources of eligible power generation and programme costs. We find that the average US citizen is willing to pay US$162 per year in higher electricity bills (95% confidence interval: US$128–260), representing a 13% increase^ 4 , in support of a NCES that requires 80% clean energy by 2035. Support for a NCES is lower among non-whites, older individuals and Republicans. We also employ our statistical model, along with census data for each state and Congressional district^ 5 , to simulate voting behaviour on a NCES by Members of Congress assuming they vote consistently with the preferences of their median voter. We estimate that Senate passage of a NCES would require an average household cost below US$59 per year, and House passage would require costs below US$48 per year. The results imply that an ‘80% by 2035’ NCES could pass both chambers of Congress if it increases electricity rates less than 5% on average. In 2010 and 2011, Republicans and Democrats in the United States proposed mandating clean electricity generation. Research has now analysed public support for a national clean energy standard (NCES) and found that the average US citizen is willing to bear an annual 13% increase in electricity bills in support of a NCES that requires 80% clean energy by 2035.",2012-08-01,10.1038/nclimate1527,"['Aldy, Joseph E.', 'Kotchen, Matthew J.', 'Leiserowitz, Anthony A.']",Nature Climate Change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1527.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1212,Physically based assessment of hurricane surge threat under climate change,"Focusing on New York City, this study investigates the impact of climate change on hurricane storm surges. The analysis shows that the frequency of surge-flooding events is likely to increase greatly owing to the combined effects of storm-climatology change and sea-level rise. Storm surges are responsible for much of the damage and loss of life associated with landfalling hurricanes. Understanding how global warming will affect hurricane surges thus holds great interest. As general circulation models (GCMs) cannot simulate hurricane surges directly, we couple a GCM-driven hurricane model with hydrodynamic models to simulate large numbers of synthetic surge events under projected climates and assess surge threat, as an example, for New York City (NYC). Struck by many intense hurricanes in recorded history and prehistory, NYC is highly vulnerable to storm surges. We show that the change of storm climatology will probably increase the surge risk for NYC; results based on two GCMs show the distribution of surge levels shifting to higher values by a magnitude comparable to the projected sea-level rise (SLR). The combined effects of storm climatology change and a 1 m SLR may cause the present NYC 100-yr surge flooding to occur every 3–20 yr and the present 500-yr flooding to occur every 25–240 yr by the end of the century.",2012-06-01,10.1038/nclimate1389,"['Lin, Ning', 'Emanuel, Kerry', 'Oppenheimer, Michael', 'Vanmarcke, Erik']",Nature Climate Change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1389.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

All scenarios are consistent with the spatial distribution of effects, exacerbating regional disparities and current vulnerability to climate. Since the results assume no restrictions on the use of water for irrigation or on the application of agrochemicals, they may be considered optimistic from the production point of view and somewhat pessimistic from the environmental point of view.

1214,Setting priorities for land management to mitigate climate change,"Background No consensus has been reached how to measure the effectiveness of climate change mitigation in the land-use sector and how to prioritize land use accordingly. We used the long-term cumulative and average sectorial C stocks in biomass, soil and products, C stock changes, the substitution of fossil energy and of energy-intensive products, and net present value (NPV) as evaluation criteria for the effectiveness of a hectare of productive land to mitigate climate change and produce economic returns. We evaluated land management options using real-life data of Thuringia, a region representative for central-western European conditions, and input from life cycle assessment, with a carbon-tracking model. We focused on solid biomass use for energy production. Results In forestry, the traditional timber production was most economically viable and most climate-friendly due to an assumed recycling rate of 80% of wood products for bioenergy. Intensification towards ""pure bioenergy production"" would reduce the average sectorial C stocks and the C substitution and would turn NPV negative. In the forest conservation (non-use) option, the sectorial C stocks increased by 52% against timber production, which was not compensated by foregone wood products and C substitution. Among the cropland options wheat for food with straw use for energy, whole cereals for energy, and short rotation coppice for bioenergy the latter was most climate-friendly. However, specific subsidies or incentives for perennials would be needed to favour this option. Conclusions When using the harvested products as materials prior to energy use there is no climate argument to support intensification by switching from sawn-wood timber production towards energy-wood in forestry systems. A legal framework would be needed to ensure that harvested products are first used for raw materials prior to energy use. Only an effective recycling of biomaterials frees land for long-term sustained C sequestration by conservation. Reuse cascades avoid additional emissions from shifting production or intensification.",2012-03-16,10.1186/1750-0680-7-5,"['Böttcher, Hannes', 'Freibauer, Annette', 'Scholz, Yvonne', 'Gitz, Vincent', 'Ciais, Philippe', 'Mund, Martina', 'Wutzler, Thomas', 'Schulze, Ernst-Detlef']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/1750-0680-7-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1215,Adaptation of California’s electricity sector to climate change,"Climate change is likely to pose considerable new challenges to California’s electricity sector. This paper primarily focuses on the adaptation challenges of an important component of the energy arena: electricity demand in the residential and commercial sectors and electricity supply. The primary challenge to California’s electricity sector will likely be the increase in demand for air conditioning as a result of rising temperatures. In addition, renewable energy sources, which are an increasing share of the electricity portfolio, are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Many of the key players have been actively considering the implications of climate change. Because electricity generation accounts for nearly 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, this sector has been a target of the state’s efforts to reduce emissions. Fortunately, many of the same tools can simultaneously improve the sector’s resilience to a changing climate. Demand management strategies and supply diversification are both important strategies. Local governments can play a central role in encouraging the adoption of more energy efficient building codes and the use of more renewable sources, such as solar energy. The positive steps taken by many local governments are encouraging. Steps to increase public awareness are an important, often missing component, however. Increases in research, development, and demonstration to improve system resiliency and develop new energy conservation tools are also needed.",2012-03-01,10.1007/s10584-011-0242-2,"['Vine, Edward']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-011-0242-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1219,"Ethanol Production, Food and Forests","This paper investigates the direct and indirect impacts of ethanol production on land use, deforestation and food production. A partial equilibrium model of a national economy with two sectors and two regions, one of which includes a forest, is developed. It analyses how an exogenous increase in the ethanol price affects input allocation (land and labor) between sectors (energy crop and food). The total effect of ethanol prices on food production and deforestation is decomposed into three partial effects. First, the well-documented effect of direct land competition between rival uses arises; it increases deforestation and decreases food production. Second, an indirect displacement of food production across regions, possibly provoked by the reaction of international food prices, increases deforestation and reduces the food sector’s output. Finally, labor mobility between sectors and regions tends to decrease food production but also deforestation. The total impact of ethanol production on food production is negative while there is an ambiguous impact on deforestation.",2012-01-01,10.1007/s10640-011-9516-4,"['Andrade de Sá, Saraly', 'Palmer, Charles', 'Engel, Stefanie']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-011-9516-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1221,Supporting greenhouse gas mitigation in developing cities: a synthesis of financial instruments,"One of the major concerns with the post-2012 global climate regime is to reach consensus on how to finance actions needed in fast-growing developing economies for significant greenhouses gases emissions mitigation. International financial and technology transfer are bound to bridge the gap under well-designed institutional framework to facilitate the transition to low(er) carbon development trajectories in developing countries. So far, cities, which contribute nearly 80% of global emissions, have not yet been recognised as a legitimate entity to implement different greenhouse gas mitigation policies and measures with relevant technical and financial abilities. Here we discuss the scope and scale of different climate-relevant financial mechanisms and describe their comparative advantages and weakness in financing climate resilient urban infrastructures (buildings and transport in particular). We show the limitations of current instruments available in scaling up necessary financial flows into developing cities to achieve the long term climate stabilisation targets. Lastly, the paper examines the feasibility of factoring the sector-wise and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA) mechanisms into local authorities’ long-term mitigation strategy by raising necessary funds to facilitate shifting the business as usual trajectories in developing cities in the next decades.",2011-08-01,10.1007/s11027-011-9288-8,"['Li, Jun']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-011-9288-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1222,Beneficial management practices and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture of the Canadian Prairie: a review,"Climate change is one of the main global issues of modern time. Ever increasing demand for food/feed and the need for higher environmental standards require shaping of the agricultural activities toward ecological and more sustainable efficient systems. One of the principal ways of attaining higher productivity and environmental standards is identification and adoption of beneficial management practices (BMP) by reviewing the conventional agricultural activities. The BMP are agricultural practices that promote sustainable land stewardship and maintain/increase profitability of farms. The BMP are from both crop and animal production systems and tradeoffs between the two systems could provide several opportunities in reducing, removing and/or avoiding of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Despite that, few reviews have presented them together. This review covers GHG emissions related to the BMP in the crop and animal production systems of farms relevant to Canadian Prairie. These BMP include: (1) use of inorganic N fertilizers, (2) livestock and feed management, (3) manure management, (4) cropping systems, (5) tillage practices and (6) improved pasture and grazing management. In addition, sources of variations, quantification methods and adoptability are discussed. Quantified GHG emissions from direct and indirect measurements of researches from Canada and other part of the world are included. Since most experiments are conducted under multiple biophysical scenarios while adopting various methodologies, summarizing the findings was difficult. The effect of BMP on GHG is determined by ecological processes. Such determinants are discussed and knowledge gaps are identified. Integration of crop and livestock production systems could further lead toward higher energy and resource use efficiency; hence less GHG emissions.",2011-07-01,10.1007/s13593-011-0016-2,"['Asgedom, Haben', 'Kebreab, Ermias']",Agronomy for Sustainable Development,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13593-011-0016-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1223,The economics of health and climate change: key evidence for decision making,"Background In responding to the health challenges of climate change, those responsible for health policies and resource allocations need to know the resource consequences of their decisions. This article examines the availability and strength of economic evidence for policy makers to draw on in making health policy decisions. Methods Relevant literature was obtained using a Medline and INTERNET search of key terms and institutions working in health and climate change. Eighteen available economic studies are presented under three categories of economic evidence: health damage cost, health adaptation cost and health economic evaluation. Results In economic studies valuing the predicted increased mortality from climate change, the health damages represent an important fraction of overall economic losses. Similarly, when considering broader health protection measures beyond the health sector (e.g. agriculture, water supply) health considerations are central. Global adaptation cost studies carried out so far indicate health sector costs of roughly US$2-5 billion annually (mid-estimates). However, these costs are expected to be an underestimate of the true costs, due to omitted health impacts, omitted economic impacts, and the costs of health actions in other sectors. No published studies compare the costs and benefits of specific health interventions to protect health from climate change. Conclusions More economic studies are needed examining the costs and benefits of adaptation measures to inform policy making. There is an urgent need for climate change-specific health economic guidelines to ensure robust methods are used, giving comparable results. Broader advocacy and focused training of decision makers is needed to increase the uptake of economic evidence in decision making. Until further climate change-specific economic studies have been conducted, decision makers should selectively draw on published studies of the costs and benefits of environmental health interventions.",2011-06-27,10.1186/1744-8603-7-18,"['Hutton, Guy']",Globalization and Health,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/1744-8603-7-18,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1224,Potential Environmental Impacts of Increased Reliance on Corn-Based Bioenergy,"This paper integrates economic and physical models to assess: a) how increases in agricultural commodity prices, driven by ethanol production and other factors, affect land use and cropping systems in the US Midwest, and b) how the changes in land use and cropping systems in turn affect environmental quality in the region. The empirical framework includes a set of econometric models that predict land conversion, crop choices, and crop rotations at the parcel level based on commodity prices, land quality, climate conditions, and other physical characteristics at the sites. The predictions are then combined with site-specific environmental production functions to determine the effect of rising commodity prices on nitrate runoff and leaching, soil water and wind erosion, and carbon sequestration. Results suggest that increasing commodity prices will result in widespread conversions of non-cropland to cropland. Fifty percent of the region’s pasture and range land will be converted to cropland with $6 corn. Rising commodity prices will also result in dramatic changes in crop mix and rotation systems in the Midwest. With $6 corn, the total acreage of corn will increase by 23% and 40% in the Corn Belt and Lake States, respectively; the acreage of continuous corn will increase considerably in both regions as well. These changes in land use and crop mix will have a large impact on agricultural pollution.

1225,Mechanized thinning of walnut plantations established on ex-arable land,"The study compares two product strategies—chips versus firewood—and two technological levels—manual versus mechanized—as applied to the thinning of walnut agroforestry plantations, established on ex-arable land. Such plantations are widespread all across Europe, and their establishment was subsidized under the provisions of EU Directive 2080/90, and of regional grant schemes. Field test data were used to build a simple deterministic model for estimating thinning productivity and cost under varying work and economic conditions. This model can assist prospective users when checking the profitability of an operation, or when assessing the competitiveness of alternative options. Removing nurse alder from young walnut plantations yields between 25 and 50 t of fresh biomass per hectare and is crucial to the good development of the stand. The study shows that the removal of nurse alder from walnut plantations is economically viable, and it can also offer some profits if stand and market conditions are favourable. As a rule, the average DBH of removal trees should not be smaller than 12 cm. Best results are obtained with mechanized harvesting, which does not seem to cause heavier stand and soil damage than manual harvesting. Manual harvesting is preferable only if the annual utilization of machinery is very low, and in this case it should be geared to firewood production. The manual whole-tree harvesting (WTH) method used in this study offers the lowest performance under all conditions, and should be replaced with some other manual alternative to WTH. Mechanized WTH offers a significant cost reduction over mechanized short-wood (SWS) harvesting, but this difference is still rather limited: hence, other parameters come into play when deciding what system to apply, and namely product price and mass output. In this respect, one also has to consider the cost of managing the harvesting residue, and that of fertilizing, if soil nutrient depletion is to be feared.",2011-05-01,10.1007/s10457-010-9348-1,"['Magagnotti, Natascia', 'Nati, Carla', 'Picchi, Gianni', 'Spinelli, Raffaele']",Agroforestry Systems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10457-010-9348-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1227,"Biofuels, the Role of Biotechnology to Improve Their Sustainability and Profitability","Energy supply and environmental change are the challenges facing humanity today. The need to develop new, carbon neutral forms of energy is now urgent. Bio-energy is a promising option that offers both energy sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. In 2005 biomass provided 13.4% of current world energy needs, mainly as a heating and cooking fuel in rural communities, However, even with the increasing contribution from industrially produced biomass fired heat and power, the use of bio-diesel from oil crops and ethanol derived from maize and sugar-cane, the overall percentage contribution of bio-energy to world energy needs diminishes with time. Increasing bio-energy use to supplement the world’s energy needs will require the growing of energy crops on a large scale, entailing changes to agricultural and forestry production techniques and the identification of new bio-energy feed-stocks. The use of ethanol from maize and sugar cane to replace petrol has more than tripled in 6 years and biodiesel from the esters of oil from crops such as palm, soya and oil seed rape now contributes 4% of Europe’s diesel needs. However these first generation biofuels use valuable arable land and food crops in competition with human food needs and are not efficient energy producers per hectare of land nor do they effectively mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Ligno-cellulosic ethanol, bio-butanol, bio-gas and biodiesel from gas to liquid bio-refineries using native grasses, Miscanthus , wood processing waste and short rotation coppice willow and non-food oil seed plants such as Jatropha enable non arable land and non food crops to be used for second generation biofuels. In addition, autotrophic algae have been shown to exceed productivity of many oil crops in using sunlight and carbon dioxide for oil accumulation.Microbial oils can also be used as feedstock for biodiesel productions with ­advantages like short life cycle, less labour intensive, less seasonal, geographical and climatic variability and easy scale up.

1228,Capital assets and institutional constraints to implementation of greenhouse gas mitigation options in agriculture,"Agriculture is one of the major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. It accounts for approximately 15% of the total global anthropogenic emissions of GHGs. Emissions could be twice as much if indirect emissions are also taken into the consideration. However, unlike other high emitting sectors such as transport or energy, agriculture is potentially a significant carbon “sink”. It has high technical potential as a carbon sink and if tapped, can substantially enhance global sequestration efforts. The technical potential, however, may not translate into actual GHG reduction because of the capital assets and institutional constraints faced by the smallholder farmers in the developing countries. In this paper we develop a capital assets based framework of physical, financial, social, human and natural barriers to agricultural carbon mitigation initiatives and through analysis of current initiatives, we set out policy based options to reduce each of these barriers. Fundamentally, barrier removal will entail designing agricultural carbon mitigation initiatives in collaboration with farmer communities, through strengthening local institutions, understanding land tenure and natural resource cultures, ensuring legitimacy and equity in payments and fast tracking training and information. We provide a framework that simultaneously aids the dual objectives of alleviating poverty in the poor farming communities of developing countries and lowering global greenhouse gas emissions.",2011-01-01,10.1007/s11027-010-9250-1,"['Dulal, Hari Bansha', 'Brodnig, Gernot', 'Shah, Kalim U.']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-010-9250-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1229,Adapting Cities to Climate Change,"As our urban systems get more complex and interdependent, they become more vulnerable to both external and internal disturbances. These disturbances have the potential to qualitatively change the system; but, if the system is resilient, it can absorb the disturbance and continue its operation. Due to climate change, cities are currently facing unprecedented environmental change and previous models designed around a linear understanding of change as incremental and predictable might not be flexible enough to respond to this change. Therefore, a new, fundamentally nonlinear, way of dealing with change in cities is required. While a great uncertainty prevails regarding the impacts of climate change particularly at the local level, it is agreed that climate change amplifies already existing threats and magnifies the needs of the most poor. However, climate change can also serve as an opportunity. The extent to which institutions and citizens take an advantage of this opportunity depends on two fundamental pillars of adaptation: the ability to understand and the ability to respond to change, both of which are addressed in the detail in this chapter.",2011-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-1770-1_12,"['Yumagulova, L.']",Climate,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-1770-1_12,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1231,Behavior of Enzymatic Activity in Chilean Volcanic Soil and Their Interactions with Clay Fraction,"Volcanic soil, Andisols, and Ultisols comprise clays with physico-chemical differences, which is crucial for the immobilization of enzymes and their catalytic properties. The properties of volcanic soils related to enzyme immobilization are described. Specifically, the characteristics of allophane, the predominant clay in Andisols, and kaolinite, the most representative clay in Ultisols, are considered. The mechanisms by which enzymes are immobilized in Andisol and Ultisol clays are described, with particular emphasis on acid phosphatase. In addition, the values of enzyme activities in volcanic soil affected by management practices such as tillage system, application of herbicides, and manganese (Mn) and molybdenum (Mo) micronutrient application are reported.",2011-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-14225-3_17,"['Rosas, Analí', 'López, Ada', 'López, Roxana']",Soil Enzymology,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-14225-3_17,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1232,The Use of Weight of Evidence for Environmental Quality Assessment in Sediments Above Sub-Seabed Geological Formations for the Storage of Carbon Dioxide,"The need for short-term measures to reduce the amounts of CO_2 in the atmosphere has led to consider CO_2 sequestration as an essential measure to be able to meet nowadays targets. However, uncertainties related to this option, in particular in relation to control on impurities of the stored gas stream, site selection and characterization, monitoring, allowed leakage rates, estimation of potential impacts and remediation of local damages in the short and long term, etc. have led the international community to develop some guidelines and frameworks within which to regulate this activity. Permanent containment of the storage sites is expected, however it is necessary to determine the risk of leakage to the marine environment and its effects. The application of the Weight-of-Evidence approach for environmental quality assessment in sediments above sub-seabed geological formations for the storage of carbon dioxide can be of paramount importance to determine the effects and potential consequences of the leakage of CO_2. This methodology satisfies the requirements set by the 1992 OSPAR Convention and 1996 London Protocol to ensure permanent containment and to guarantee the integrity of the marine environment and human health.",2011-01-01,10.1007/978-90-481-9821-4_8,"['Casillas, Tomás-Ángel DelValls', 'Tayá, Diana Fernández de la Reguera', 'López, Maria Inmaculada Riba', 'Pajares, Jesus María Forja']",Oceans and the Atmospheric Carbon Content,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-90-481-9821-4_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1233,Social participation and climate change,"Social participation has been broadly analysed by comparing case studies of different types of socio-economic developments in Brazil and the United Kingdom (UK). A key objective has been to consider how effective social participation has been in incorporating society’s points of view in the decision making process. In most cases, it would appear that very little can be done by stakeholders to change big decisions on development policies that support public and private development because in reality social participation often only provides an opportunity for discussion and agreement on specific issues regarding how development will be undertaken and how stakeholders will be affected. Although Brazil and the United Kingdom have socio-economic and cultural differences, it is necessary to emphasize that education, self-organization and knowledge of civil rights are crucial for an effective social participation process. As climate change is an important topic for present and future generations and that some of the development activities analysed in this study will emit greenhouse gases, this study also attempts to investigate if climate change mitigation strategies have been integrated into the social participation process. Investigation shows that there is little evidence that climate change mitigation actions involving stakeholders have been integrated into development strategies or have been part of social participation schemes in the case studies analysed. Having said that, the study also describes positive examples of climate change mitigation actions in different parts of the world that involve local people in ‘carbon-neutral’ or ‘social-carbon’ projects and proposes the creation of a carbon - neutral committee that would be responsible for coordinating climate change mitigation measures within development proposals such as the ones analysed in this study.",2010-10-01,10.1007/s10668-009-9224-1,"['Braun, Ricardo']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-009-9224-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1234,Planning hydrological restoration of peatlands in Indonesia to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions,"Extensive degradation of Indonesian peatlands by deforestation, drainage and recurrent fires causes release of huge amounts of peat soil carbon to the atmosphere. Construction of drainage canals is associated with conversion to other land uses, especially plantations of oil palm and pulpwood trees, and with widespread illegal logging to facilitate timber transport. A lowering of the groundwater level leads to an increase in oxidation and subsidence of peat. Therefore, the groundwater level is the main control on carbon dioxide emissions from peatlands. Restoring the peatland hydrology is the only way to prevent peat oxidation and mitigate CO_2 emissions. In this study we present a strategy for improved planning of rewetting measures by dam constructions. The study area is a vast peatland with limited accessibility in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Field inventory and remote sensing data are used to generate a detailed 3D model of the peat dome and a hydrological model predicts the rise in groundwater levels once dams have been constructed. Successful rewetting of a 590 km² large area of drained peat swamp forest could result in mitigated emissions of 1.4–1.6 Mt CO_2 yearly. This equates to 6% of the carbon dioxide emissions by civil aviation in the European Union in 2006 and can be achieved with relatively small efforts and at low costs. The proposed methodology allows a detailed planning of hydrological restoration of peatlands with interesting impacts on carbon trading for the voluntary carbon market.",2010-03-01,10.1007/s11027-010-9214-5,"['Jaenicke, Julia', 'Wösten, Henk', 'Budiman, Arif', 'Siegert, Florian']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-010-9214-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

Furthermore, growing evidence suggests that combustion of fossil fuels is precipitating climate change (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007).

1237,Three Paths to Forest Expansion: A Comparative Historical Analysis,"During the past century forests have expanded in three ways, through spontaneously regenerated secondary forests, planted forest monocultures, and planted but biodiverse household agro-forests. Each type of forest emerges out of a distinct human geographical situation. Forests regenerate spontaneously, usually after people have left the land for one reason or another. Forest plantations frequently occupy landscapes where a few landowners control much of the land. Finally, agro-forests sprout in densely populated, smallholder dominated landscapes close to urban markets. This chapter describes each set of forest generating circumstances and the associated sets of causal conditions in some detail, paying particular attention to the human geographical forces that continue to drive spontaneous reforestation in some places at the same time that they have induced people to plant trees (promoted reforestation) in other places. A final section describes policy initiatives that would encourage or expedite the expansion of forests.",2010-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4020-9656-3_3,"['Rudel, Thomas K.']",Reforesting Landscapes,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4020-9656-3_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1239,Effects of forest conversion on soil labile organic carbon fractions and aggregate stability in subtropical China,"Soil labile fractions play an important role in improving soil quality due to its ability of maintaining soil fertility and minimizing negative environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of forest transition (conversion of natural broadleaf forests into monoculture tree plantations) on soil labile fractions (light fraction organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, and microbial biomass carbon). Soil samples were collected from a natural forest of Castanopsis kawakamii Hayata (NF) and two adjacent 36-year-old monoculture plantations of C. kawakamii (CK) and Cunninghamia lanceolata Lamb. (Chinese fir) (CF) at Xinkou Experimental Forestry Centre, southeastern China. In the 0–100 cm depth, the light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were significantly lower in the CK and CF than in the NF ( P  < 0.05). Generally, LFOC, POC and MBC contents declined consistently with profile depth. Significant differences in LFOC, POC and MBC concentrations between the native forest and two plantations were detected at 0–40 cm depth, especially the top 10 cm, whereas there was less change below 40 cm, indicating that labile fraction losses due to forest transition mainly occurred in the surface soils. The three indices of labile organic carbon were closely correlated, suggesting they are interrelated properties. Labile fractions (LFOC, POC and MBC) were more sensitive indicators of SOC change resulting from the forest transition. We also found that forest types significantly affected the water stable aggregate >0.25 mm content (WSA) at the 0–10 cm depth. It suggested that converting old-growth native forest to intensively-managed plantations would reduce labile organic C, which may be attributed to a combination of factors including quantity of litter materials, microbial activity and management disturbances, which would change greatly with the forest conversion. How long these changes would persist needs the further study.",2009-10-01,10.1007/s11104-009-9921-4,"['Yang, Yusheng', 'Guo, Jianfen', 'Chen, Guangshui', 'Yin, Yunfeng', 'Gao, Ren', 'Lin, Chengfang']",Plant and Soil,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11104-009-9921-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1240,Winter mulch increases soil CO_2 efflux under Phyllostachys praecox stands,"Purpose The bamboo species Phyllostachys praecox has been planted in large areas of southern China for the production of edible bamboo shoots. In recent years, high rates of fertilizer application and heavy winter mulch have been employed to achieve an earlier harvest of the shoots and a better economic return. Little is known about the potential impact of these intensive management practices on the receiving environment. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted to quantify the effect of winter mulch on soil CO_2 efflux, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Materials and methods The field study was established in 6-year-old P. praecox stands for the period between December 2006 and February 2007 in Lin’an County, Zhejiang Province, China. The treatments included a 200-mm mulch with rice straw and rice husks, and a control without mulch. Soil CO_2 efflux rates and soil temperature changes were measured monthly and comparisons were made between the treatments. Results and discussion Soil CO_2 efflux rates in the mulch treatment were 10.98 and 4.27 µmol m^−2 s^−1 in December 2006 and January 2007, respectively, which was eight times greater than soil CO_2 efflux rates measured in the non-mulch control treatment in the corresponding months. The significantly higher temperature and increased dissolved organic carbon in the mulch treatment were considered to have contributed to the enhanced soil CO_2 emission. Conclusions Heavy winter mulch in a P. praecox plantation can greatly enhance soil respiration rates due to increases in both soil temperature and readily mineralizable labile organic matter. The increased CO_2 emissions from soil respiration under winter mulch treatments can potentially reduce the greenhouse gas emission mitigation function of the bamboo forest plantations. It is recommended that new management practices be developed to alleviate the impacts of winter mulch on the environment.",2009-09-25,10.1007/s11368-009-0134-5,"['Jiang, Peikun', 'Wang, Hailong', 'Wu, Jiasen', 'Xu, Qiufang', 'Zhou, Guomo']",Journal of Soils and Sediments,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11368-009-0134-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

This paper reviews agricultural options to reduce energy intensities and their impacts, discusses important accounting issues related to system boundaries, land scarcity, and measurement units and compares agricultural energy intensities and improvement potentials on an international level. Agricultural development in recent decades, while increasing yields, has led to lower average energy efficiencies when comparing the 1960s and the mid 1980s. In the two decades thereafter, energy intensities in developed countries increased, but with little impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Efficiency differences across countries in the year 2000 suggest a maximum improvement potential of 500 million tons of CO_2 annually. If only below average countries would increase their energy efficiency to average levels of the year 2000, the resulting emission reductions would be below 200 million tons of CO_2 annually.",2009-05-01,10.1007/s12053-008-9035-5,"['Schneider, Uwe A.', 'Smith, Pete']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12053-008-9035-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1243,Environmental Costs and Benefits of Transportation Biofuel Production from Food-and Lignocellulose-Based Energy Crops: A Review,"Transportation biofuel production in the United States is currently dominated by ethanol from the grain of maize and, to a much lesser extent, biodiesel from soybeans. Although using these biofuels avoids many of the environmentally detrimental aspects of petroleum-based fossil fuels, biofuel production has its own environmental costs, largely related to fossil fuel use in converting crops to biofuels and crop cultivation itself, including ecological damages caused by nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers, pesticides, and erosion. A new generation of biofuels derived from lignocellulosic sources offers greatly reduced environmental impacts while potentially avoiding conflicts between food and energy production. In particular, diverse mixtures of native prairie species offer biomass feedstocks that may yield greater net energy gains than monoculture energy crops when converted into biofuels, while also providing wildlife habitat and enriching degraded soils through carbon sequestration and nitrogen fixation. Ultimately, as demand for both food and energy rise in the coming decades, greater consideration will need to be given to how land can best be used for the greater benefit of society.",2009-01-01,10.1007/978-90-481-2666-8_10,"['Hill, Jason']",Sustainable Agriculture,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-90-481-2666-8_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1245,Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential of Corn Ethanol: Accounting for Corn Acreage Expansion,"Combustion of corn-based ethanol substantially offsets net Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by the recycling of carbon dioxide (CO_2) stored as biomass. However, the GHG mitigation effect may be partially countered by the growth of CO_2 emissions from the increased corn production resulting from the increased demand for corn and higher corn prices. This study assesses the effect for a major U.S. crop production region, the Boone River watershed in Iowa. We use economic models on GIS-based land use and soils data for some 8,275 fields in the watershed to estimate the effect of an increase in corn prices on crop rotations and tillage intensity. The associated changes in soil carbon are estimated using the field-scale Environmental Policy Impact Climate simulation model by comparing soil organic carbon content under the baseline with that under the simulated cropping patterns. A corn price increase from $2 to $4 per bushel ($78.74 to $157.47 per t) is predicted to lead to the switch from the corn-soybean rotation to continuous corn and from the mulch to conventional tillage on the most of the watershed. The associated CO_2 emissions are estimated at 63,711 tons (57,799 t) per year higher than under the baseline.",2009-01-01,10.1007/978-0-387-88483-7_34,"['Kurkalova, Lyubov A.', 'Secchi, Silvia', 'Gassman, Phillip W.']",Proceedings of the 2007 National Conference on Environmental Science and Technology,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-0-387-88483-7_34,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

Posterity brings great uncertainties. Even massive losses, such as human extinction, however, do not merit infinite negative utility. Given learning, greater uncertainties about damages could increase or decrease the optimal level of current mitigation activities.

1248,"Population, uncertainty, and learning in climate change decision analysis","The prospect of learning about various uncertainties relevant to analyses of the climate change issue is important because it can affect estimates of the costs of both damages and mitigation, and it can influence the optimal timing of emissions reductions. Baseline scenarios representing future emissions in the absence of mitigation are one of the major sources of uncertainty. Here we investigate how fast we might realistically expect to learn about the outlook for long-term population growth, as one determinant of future baseline emissions. That is, we estimate how long it might take to substantially revise current estimates of the likelihood of various population size outcomes over the twenty-first century. We draw on recent work showing that, because population growth is path dependent, we can learn about the long term outlook by waiting to observe how population changes in the short term. We then explore the implications of uncertainty and of this learning potential for mitigation costs and for optimal emissions. Using a simple model, we show that uncertainty in population growth translates into an uncertainty in the optimal tax rate of about $200/tC by 2050 for a range of stabilization levels. When learning is taken into account, it allows for mitigation strategies to change in response to new information, leading to a slight reduction in the expected value of mitigation costs, and a substantial reduction in the likelihood of high cost outcomes. We also find that while learning can lead to large revisions over the next few decades in anticipated population growth, this potential does not imply large changes in near-term optimal emissions reductions. Results suggest that further work on the potential for learning about other determinants of emissions could have larger effects on expected mitigation costs.",2008-06-10,10.1007/s10584-008-9419-8,"['O’Neill, Brian C.', 'Sanderson, Warren']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-008-9419-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1249,The role of carbon plantations in mitigating climate change: potentials and costs,"A methodology is presented to construct supply curves and cost–supply curves for carbon plantations based on land-use scenarios from the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE 2). A sensitivity analysis for assessing which factors are most important in shaping these curves is also presented. In the IPCC SRES B2 Scenario, the carbon sequestration potential on abandoned agricultural land increases from 60 MtC/year in 2010 to 2,700 MtC/year in 2100 for prices up to 1,000 $/tC, assuming harvest when the mean annual increment decreases and assuming no environmental, economical or political barriers in the implementation-phase. Taking these barriers into consideration would reduce the potential by at least 60%. On the other hand, the potential will increase 55 to 75% if plantations on harvested timberland are considered. Taking into account land and establishment costs, the largest part of the potential up to 2025 can be supplied below 100 $/tC (In this article all dollar values are in US dollars of 1995, unless indicated otherwise.). Beyond 2050, more than 50% of the costs come to over 200 $/tC. Compared to other mitigation options, this is relative cheap. So a large part of the potential will likely be used in an overall mitigation strategy. However, since huge emission reductions are probably needed, the relative contribution of plantations will be low (around 3%). The largest source of uncertainty with respect to both potentials and costs is the growth rate of plantations compared to the natural vegetation.",2008-06-01,10.1007/s10584-007-9334-4,"['Strengers, Bart J.', 'Minnen, Jelle G.', 'Eickhout, Bas']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-007-9334-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1251,Quantifying the effectiveness of climate change mitigation through forest plantations and carbon sequestration with an integrated land-use model,"Background Carbon plantations are introduced in climate change policy as an option to slow the build-up of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO_2) concentrations. Here we present a methodology to evaluate the potential effectiveness of carbon plantations. The methodology explicitly considers future long-term land-use change around the world and all relevant carbon (C) fluxes, including all natural fluxes. Both issues have generally been ignored in earlier studies. Results Two different baseline scenarios up to 2100 indicate that uncertainties in future land-use change lead to a near 100% difference in estimates of carbon sequestration potentials. Moreover, social, economic and institutional barriers preventing carbon plantations in natural vegetation areas decrease the physical potential by 75–80% or more. Nevertheless, carbon plantations can still considerably contribute to slowing the increase in the atmospheric CO_2 concentration but only in the long term. The most conservative set of assumptions lowers the increase of the atmospheric CO_2 concentration in 2100 by a 27 ppm and compensates for 5–7% of the total energy-related CO_2 emissions. The net sequestration up to 2020 is limited, given the short-term increased need for agricultural land in most regions and the long period needed to compensate for emissions through the establishment of the plantations. The potential is highest in the tropics, despite projections that most of the agricultural expansion will be in these regions. Plantations in high latitudes as Northern Europe and Northern Russia should only be established if the objective to sequester carbon is combined with other activities. Conclusion Carbon sequestration in plantations can play an important role in mitigating the build-up of atmospheric CO_2. The actual magnitude depends on natural and management factors, social barriers, and the time frame considered.

1252,A data support infrastructure for Clean Development Mechanism forestry implementation: an inventory perspective from Cameroon,"Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) forestry project development requires highly multi-disciplinary and multiple-source information that can be complex, cumbersome and costly to acquire. Yet developing countries in which CDM projects are created and implemented are often data poor environments and unable to meet such complex information requirements. Using Cameroon as an example, the present paper explores the structure of an enabling host country data support infrastructure for CDM forestry implementation, and also assesses the supply potential of current forestry information. Results include a conceptual data model of CDM project data needs; the list of meso- and macro-level data and information requirements (Demand analysis); and an inventory of relevant data available in Cameroon (Supply analysis). From a comparison of demand and supply, we confirm that data availability and the relevant infrastructure for data or information generation is inadequate for supporting carbon forestry at the micro, meso and macro-levels in Cameroon. The results suggest that current CDM afforestation and reforestation information demands are almost impenetrable for local communities in host countries and pose a number of cross-scale barriers to project adoption. More importantly, we identify proactive regulatory, institutional and capacity building policy strategies for forest data management improvements that could enhance biosphere carbon management uptake in poor countries. CDM forestry information research needs are also highlighted.",2008-02-01,10.1007/s11027-007-9084-7,"['Minang, Peter A.', 'McCall, Michael K.', 'Skutsch, Margaret M.', 'Verplanke, Jeroen J.']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-007-9084-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1253,Methane Emissions from Large Dams as Renewable Energy Resources: A Developing Nation Perspective,"By means of a theoretical model, bootstrap resampling and data provided by the International Commission On Large Dams (ICOLD ( 2003 ) World register of dams. http://www.icold-cigb.org) we found that global large dams might annually release about 104 ± 7.2 Tg CH_4 to the atmosphere through reservoir surfaces, turbines and spillways. Engineering technologies can be implemented to avoid these emissions, and to recover the non-emitted CH_4 for power generation. The immediate benefit of recovering non-emitted CH_4 from large dams for renewable energy production is the mitigation of anthropogenic impacts like the construction of new large dams, the actual CH_4 emissions from large dams, and the use of unsustainable fossil fuels and natural gas reserves. Under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, such technologies can be recognized as promising alternatives for human adaptations to climate change concerning sustainable power generation, particularly in developing nations owning a considerable number of large dams. In view of novel technologies to extract CH_4 from large dams, we estimate that roughly 23 ± 2.6, 2.6 ± 0.2 and 32 ± 5.1 Tg CH_4 could be used as an environmentally sound option for power generation in Brazil, China and India, respectively. For the whole world this number may increase to around 100 ± 6.9 Tg CH_4.",2008-02-01,10.1007/s11027-007-9086-5,"['Lima, Ivan B. T.', 'Ramos, Fernando M.', 'Bambace, Luis A.

1254,Climate or development: is ODA diverted from its original purpose?,"We analyze the interaction of climate and development policy that has taken place since the early 1990s. Increasing dissatisfaction about the results of traditional development cooperation and the appeal of climate policy as a new policy field led to a rapid reorientation of aid flows. At the turn of the century, over 7% of aid flows were spent on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. However, the contribution of emissions mitigation projects to the central development objective of poverty reduction as specified in the Millennium Development Goals is limited and other project types are likely to be much more effective. Adaptation to climate change can be expected to have higher synergies with poverty alleviation than mitigation, primarily through its impact on health, the conservation of arable land and the protection against natural disasters. An analysis of the Clean Development Mechanism shows that projects addressing the poor directly are very rare; even small renewable energy projects in rural areas tend to benefit rich farmers and the urban population. Use of development aid for CDM projects and / or their preparation via capacity building is thus clearly not warranted. We further analyze whether the use of development aid for climate policy could be justified as a countermeasure against the emission increase related to successful development itself. However, countries that are achieving an improvement of human development from a low level are unlikely to increase their energy consumption substantially. Only at a level where the middle class expands rapidly, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions soar. Thus targeting middle class energy consumption by appliance efficiency standards and public transport-friendly urban planning are the most effective measures to address developing country emissions. Rural renewable energy provision in poor countries has a much higher impact on poverty, but a much lower impact on greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that while there are valid reasons for long-term collaboration with emerging economies on greenhouse gas mitigation, there should be a separate budget line for such activities to avoid “obfuscation” of a decline of resources aimed at poverty alleviation. Nevertheless, mitigation will remain attractive for donors because it ensures quick disbursements and relatively simple measures of success. Moreover, mitigation activities in developing countries provide politicians in industrialized countries with a welcome strategy to divert the attention of their constituencies from the lack of success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions domestically.",2007-09-01,10.1007/s10584-007-9270-3,"['Michaelowa, Axel', 'Michaelowa, Katharina']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-007-9270-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1255,Application of the “Climafor” baseline to determine leakage: the case of Scolel Té,"The acceptance of forestry-based project activities to mitigate greenhouse gases emissions has been subjected to a number of methodological questions to be answered, of which the most challenging are baseline establishment and identification of and measuring leakage. Here we pose hypotheses for and quantify leakage of the Scolel Té project in Chiapas, Mexico. In this project small-scale farmers are implementing forestry, agroforestry, and forest conservation activities, with carbon sequestration as one of the goals. The main leakage monitoring domain is defined as the area owned by the participating farmers or communities outside the area where the specific project activities take place. The null-hypothesis (no leakage) is that non-project land owned by the farmer or community will experience the same carbon stock changes as predicted by the regional baseline, specifically developed for the project. First we assessed the most likely causes and sources of leakage that may occur in the project. From this analysis, one type of leakage seems to be important, i.e., activity shifting. Second we estimated the leakage of a sample of participating farmers and communities. Actual land use was then compared with expected land use derived from the baseline. The Plan Vivo of each participant, complemented with readily available tools to identify the main sources and drivers of leakage are used to develop simple leakage assessment procedures, as demonstrated in this paper. Negative leakage was estimated to be negligible in this study. Incorporating these procedures already in the project planning stage will reduce the uncertainties related to the actual carbon mitigation potential of any forestry project.",2007-07-01,10.1007/s11027-006-9068-z,"['Jong, B.

1256,Nitrate accumulation and greenhouse gas emissions during compost storage,"Greenhouse gases (CO_2, CH_4 and N_2O) are emitted during livestock manure handling, including composting, storage and land application. However, published data on emission rates of these gases during storage are sparse. In this study, the levels of GHG emissions and N levels during compost storage were investigated. The compost materials were produced by composting livestock manure for 133 d with 0, 10, 20 and 30% phosphogypsum (PG) or 10, 20 and 30% sand amendment. These compost materials were then stored on a clay pad for 233 d. Results from this study indicated that TN content did not change but mineral N content increased significantly during the 233 d storage for all treatments. The higher mineral N content in compost increases its agronomic value. There were only trace amounts of CH_4 and N_2O emissions. The C loss during storage was mainly as CO_2 and accounted for about 2.9 to 10% of total C initially in the compost. This information is vital to livestock manure life cycle analysis, and can be used to develop best manure management strategies that reduce GHG emissions from livestock production.",2007-06-01,10.1007/s10705-006-9084-0,"['Hao, Xiying']",Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10705-006-9084-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1257,A scenario based analysis of land competition between food and bioenergy production in the US,"Greenhouse gas abatement policies will increase the demand for renewable sources of energy, including bioenergy. In combination with a global growing demand for food, this could lead to a food-fuel competition for bio-productive land. Proponents of bioenergy have suggested that energy crop plantations may be established on less productive land as a way of avoiding this potential food-fuel competition. However, many of these suggestions have been made without any underlying economic analysis. In this paper, we develop a long-term economic optimization model (LUCEA) of the U.S. agricultural and energy system to analyze this possible competition for land and to examine the link between carbon prices, the energy system dynamics and the effect of the land competition on food prices. Our results indicate that bioenergy plantations will be competitive on cropland already at carbon taxes about US $20/ton C. As the carbon tax increases, food prices more than double compared to the reference scenario in which there is no climate policy. Further, bioenergy plantations appropriate significant areas of both cropland and grazing land. In model runs where we have limited the amount of grazing land that can be used for bioenergy to what many analysts consider the upper limit, most of the bioenergy plantations are established on cropland. Under the assumption that more grazing land can be used, large areas of bioenergy plantations are established on grazing land, despite the fact that yields are assumed to be much lower (less than half) than on crop land. It should be noted that this allocation on grazing land takes place as a result of a competition between food and bioenergy production and not because of lack of it. The estimated increase in food prices is largely unaffected by how much grazing land can be used for bioenergy production.",2007-06-01,10.1007/s10584-006-9208-1,"['Johansson, Daniel J.

We examine the possibility for regional sustainable agricultural management practice that combines both maintenance and gain in soil carbon level with profit maximization. Future scenarios of Regional Agricultural Production Systems (RAPS) were constructed for 2000–2070 based on linking the effects of global climate change, predicted change in productivity parameters for the main agricultural crops, land-use and soil database parameters. The RAPS were used to examine profitability and feasibility of alternative agricultural scenarios, based on an economic model.

1259,Potential conflicts for the reuse of rice husk in Thailand,"This study aims to investigate the impact of rice-husk power generation on agricultural uses of rice husk and its ash. We conducted case studies at a rice-husk power plant and organic farming groups in northeast Thailand. The case study on a rice-husk power plant showed that rice husk was useful in generating electricity without consuming fossil fuel, while husk ash, the by-product, could be utilized as silicate supplement for farmland soils. The case study on organic farming groups indicated that rice husk was one of the indispensable materials in conducting organic farming with locally available resources. On the basis of these findings, an analytical study on possible husk uses in Thailand was conducted, in which three potential major uses of rice husk were considered: i.e. (1) fuel use inside rice mills followed by husk-ash reuse, (2) fuel use at power plants followed by husk-ash reuse, and (3) direct reuse of husk for compost production. The result indicated that there would be conflicting demands for rice husk among those uses in the future. Therefore, there needs to be a strategy for balancing husk uses among them.",2007-06-01,10.1007/s10333-007-0069-7,"['Ueda, Tatsuki', 'Kunimitsu, Yoji', 'Shinogi, Yoshiyuki']",Paddy and Water Environment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10333-007-0069-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1260,Leakage and Comparative Advantage Implications of Agricultural Participation in Greenhouse Gas Emission Mitigation,"The world is moving toward efforts to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. Reduction efforts may involve the agricultural sector through options such as planting of trees, altering crop and livestock management, and increasing production of biofuels. However, such options can be competitive with domestic food production. In a free trade arena, reduced domestic food production could stimulate increased production and exports in other countries, which are not pursuing net emission reductions. As a consequence, emission reduction efforts in implementing countries may be offset by production increases stimulated in other countries. We examine the competitive effects of agriculturally related emission reduction actions on agricultural production and international trade. In doing this, we employ the assumption that U.S. emission reduction caused cost increases will also occur in other reducing countries. We consider emission reduction: 1) unilaterally by the U.S., 2) by all Kyoto Protocol Annex B countries, and 3) globally. The results, which are only suggestive of the types of effects that would be observed due to the simplifying cost assumptions, indicate compliance causes supply cutbacks in regulated countries and increases in non-regulated countries. The study results show that producers in regulating countries are likely to benefit and consumers lose due to commodity price increases.",2007-05-01,10.1007/s11027-006-2941-y,"['Lee, Heng-Chi', 'McCarl, Bruce A.', 'Schneider, Uwe A.', 'Chen, Chi-Chung']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-006-2941-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1261,Environmental costs and benefits of transportation biofuel production from food- and lignocellulose-based energy crops. A review,"Transportation biofuel production in the United States is currently dominated by ethanol from the grain of maize and, to a much lesser extent, biodiesel from soybeans. Although using these biofuels avoids many of the environmentally detrimental aspects of petroleum-based fossil fuels, biofuel production has its own environmental costs, largely related to fossil fuel use in converting crops to biofuels and crop cultivation itself, including ecological damages caused by nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers, pesticides, and erosion. A new generation of biofuels derived from lignocellulosic sources offers greatly reduced environmental impacts while potentially avoiding conflicts between food and energy production. In particular, diverse mixtures of native prairie species offer biomass feedstocks that may yield greater net energy gains than monoculture energy crops when converted into biofuels, while also providing wildlife habitat and enriching degraded soils through carbon sequestration and nitrogen fixation. Ultimately, as demand for both food and energy rise in the coming decades, greater consideration will need to be given to how land can best be used for the greater benefit of society.",2007-03-01,10.1051/agro:2007006,"['Hill, Jason']",Agronomy for Sustainable Development,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1051/agro:2007006,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1262,Stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations at low levels: an assessment of reduction strategies and costs,"On the basis of the IPCC B2, A1b and B1 baseline scenarios, mitigation scenarios were developed that stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at 650, 550 and 450 and – subject to specific assumptions – 400 ppm CO_2-eq. The analysis takes into account a large number of reduction options, such as reductions of non-CO_2 gases, carbon plantations and measures in the energy system. The study shows stabilization as low as 450 ppm CO_2-eq. to be technically feasible, even given relatively high baseline scenarios. To achieve these lower concentration levels, global emissions need to peak within the first two decades. The net present value of abatement costs for the B2 baseline scenario (a medium scenario) increases from 0.2% of cumulative GDP to 1.1% as the shift is made from 650 to 450 ppm. On the other hand, the probability of meeting a two-degree target increases from 0%–10% to 20%–70%. The mitigation scenarios lead to lower emissions of regional air pollutants but also to increased land use. The uncertainty in the cost estimates is at least in the order of 50%, with the most important uncertainties including land-use emissions, the potential for bio-energy and the contribution of energy efficiency. Furthermore, creating the right socio-economic and political conditions for mitigation is more important than any of the technical constraints.",2007-03-01,10.1007/s10584-006-9172-9,"['Vuuren, Detlef P.', 'Elzen, Michel G.

1263,Understanding public complacency about climate change: adults’ mental models of climate change violate conservation of matter,"Public attitudes about climate change reveal a contradiction. Surveys show most Americans believe climate change poses serious risks but also that reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions sufficient to stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations can be deferred until there is greater evidence that climate change is harmful. US policymakers likewise argue it is prudent to wait and see whether climate change will cause substantial economic harm before undertaking policies to reduce emissions. Such wait-and-see policies erroneously presume climate change can be reversed quickly should harm become evident, underestimating substantial delays in the climate’s response to anthropogenic forcing. We report experiments with highly educated adults – graduate students at MIT – showing widespread misunderstanding of the fundamental stock and flow relationships, including mass balance principles, that lead to long response delays. GHG emissions are now about twice the rate of GHG removal from the atmosphere. GHG concentrations will therefore continue to rise even if emissions fall, stabilizing only when emissions equal removal. In contrast, most subjects believe atmospheric GHG concentrations can be stabilized while emissions into the atmosphere continuously exceed the removal of GHGs from it. These beliefs – analogous to arguing a bathtub filled faster than it drains will never overflow – support wait-and-see policies but violate conservation of matter. Low public support for mitigation policies may arise from misconceptions of climate dynamics rather than high discount rates or uncertainty about the impact of climate change. Implications for education and communication between scientists and nonscientists (the public and policymakers) are discussed.",2007-02-01,10.1007/s10584-006-9107-5,"['Sterman, John D.', 'Sweeney, Linda Booth']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-006-9107-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1264,Competitiveness of terrestrial greenhouse gas offsets: are they a bridge to the future?,"Activities to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by biological soil or forest carbon sequestration predominantly utilize currently known, readily implementable technologies. Many other greenhouse gas emission reduction options require future technological development or must wait for turnover of capital stock. Carbon sequestration options in soils and forests, while ready to go now, generally have a finite life, allowing use until other strategies are developed. This paper reports on an investigation of the competitiveness of biological carbon sequestration from a dynamic and multiple strategy viewpoint. Key factors affecting the competitiveness of terrestrial mitigation options are land availability and cost effectiveness relative to other options including CO_2 capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, fuel switching, and non-CO_2 greenhouse gas emission reductions. The analysis results show that, at lower CO_2 prices and in the near term, soil carbon and other agricultural/forestry options can be important bridges to the future, initially providing a substantial portion of attainable reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions, but with a limited role in later years. At higher CO_2 prices, afforestation and biofuels are more dominant among terrestrial options to offset greenhouse gas emissions. But in the longer run, allowing for capital stock turnover, options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy system and biofuels provide an increasing share of potential reductions in total US greenhouse gas emissions.",2007-01-01,10.1007/s10584-006-9168-5,"['McCarl, Bruce A.', 'Sands, Ronald D.']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-006-9168-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1265,Positive Spillovers of Energy Policies on Natural Areas in Poland: an AGE Analysis,"Current climate policies in Poland target for an increase in bioelectricity share in total electricity production. In Poland most of the renewable energy comes from biomass (around 90%). Most probably, in the future, biomass will continue to play a dominant role within the renewable energy sources. Except of their primary functions, such as providing CO_2 neutral fuels and decreasing dependency on oil, biomass plantations can positively influence the environment. They carry similar functions to natural areas e.g. they can contribute to the improvement of soil and water quality, sequester carbon in the soil and create an environment for many species. However, an often-heard concern is that large-scale biomass plantations might increase pressure on the productive land and might cause a substantial increase of food prices. The aim of this chapter is to investigate the impact of different energy policies, focused on increasing the shares of bioelectricity in the total electricity production, on production and prices of agricultural goods and electricity and on changes in land cover.",2007-01-01,10.1007/978-3-540-35484-0_16,"['Ignaciuk, Adriana M.']",Regional Externalities,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-540-35484-0_16,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1266,Estimating the economic potential for agricultural soil carbon sequestration in the Central United States using an aggregate econometric-process simulation model,"The purpose of this paper is to develop and apply a new method to assess economic potential for agricultural greenhouse gas mitigation. This method uses secondary economic data and conventional econometric production models, combined with estimates of soil carbon stocks derived from biophysical simulation models such as Century, to construct economic simulation models that estimate economic potential for carbon sequestration. Using this method, simulations for the central United States show that reduction in fallow and conservation tillage adoption in the wheat-pasture system could generate up to about 1.7 million MgC/yr, whereas increased adoption of conservation tillage in the corn–soy–feed system could generate up to about 6.2 million MgC/yr at a price of $200/MgC. About half of this potential could be achieved at relatively low carbon prices (in the range of $50 per ton). The model used in this analysis produced estimates of economic potential for soil carbon sequestration potential similar to results produced by much more data-intensive, field-scale models, suggesting that this simpler, aggregate modeling approach can produce credible estimates of soil carbon sequestration potential. Carbon rates were found to vary substantially over the region. Using average carbon rates for the region, the model produced carbon sequestration estimates within about 10% of those based on county-specific carbon rates, suggesting that effects of spatial heterogeneity in carbon rates may average out over a large region such as the central United States. However, the average carbon rates produced large prediction errors for individual counties, showing that estimates of carbon rates do need to be matched to the spatial scale of analysis. Transaction costs were found to have a potentially important impact on soil carbon supply at low carbon prices, particularly when carbon rates are low, but this effect diminishes as carbon prices increase.",2007-01-01,10.1007/s10584-006-9176-5,"['Antle, John M.', 'Capalbo, Susan M.', 'Paustian, Keith', 'Ali, Md Kamar']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-006-9176-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1267,Emissions scenarios database and regional mitigation analysis: a review of post-TAR mitigation scenarios,"The objectives of this study were to carry out a review of mitigation scenarios that have emerged since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report (TAR), to update the current Emissions Scenarios Database with these scenarios, and to analyze emissions and mitigation scenarios. This article first discusses the characterization of mitigation scenarios and systematically classifies mitigation scenarios. Second, quantitative analyses on gross domestic product (GDP), population, carbon intensity, energy intensity, and carbon taxes are conducted at the regional level in the four regional aggregations used by the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios. Results show that the range of emissions trajectories is extensive and that the maximum potential mitigation of global CO_2 emissions from the baseline level by 2100 is around 95%. There is a correlation between GDP growth and energy intensity improvement. The relationship between energy intensity improvement and carbon intensity reduction changes over the 21st century, with energy intensity improvement outweighing carbon intensity reduction in the first half of the century and carbon intensity reduction becoming more dominant in the latter half. Predicted carbon tax levels for 2100 range from around 50 to 1400 US$/t-C, although a uniform level of carbon tax brings about widely varying CO_2 mitigation outcomes across different regions. The range of GDP loss, resulting from CO_2 emissions mitigation, varies from −10% to 40% in 2100, with GDP losses in developing regions more evident than those in developed regions.",2006-09-01,10.1007/BF03354008,"['Hanaoka, Tatsuya', 'Kainuma, Mikiko', 'Kawase, Reina', 'Matsuoka, Yuzuru']",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/BF03354008,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1269,The Potential Impact of Agricultural Management and Climate Change on Soil Organic Carbon of the North Central Region of the United States,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) represents a significant pool of carbon within the biosphere. Climatic shifts in temperature and precipitation have a major influence on the decomposition and amount of SOC stored within an ecosystem. We have linked net primary production algorithms, which include the impact of enhanced atmospheric CO_2 on plant growth, to the Soil Organic Carbon Resources And Transformations in EcoSystems (SOCRATES) model to develop a SOC map for the North Central Region of the United States between the years 1850 and 2100 in response to agricultural activity and climate conditions generated by the CSIRO Mk2 Global Circulation Model (GCM) and based on the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) IS92a emission scenario. We estimate that the current day (1990) stocks of SOC in the top 10 cm of the North Central Region to be 4692 Mt, and 8090 Mt in the top 20 cm of soil. This is 19% lower than the pre-settlement steady state value predicted by the SOCRATES model.

By using a farm-type, supply-side oriented, linear-programming model of the European agriculture, the baseline levels of methane and nitrous oxide emissions are assessed at the regional level in the EU-15. For a range of CO_2-equivalent prices, we assess the potential abatement, as well as the resulting optimal mix of emission sources in the total abatement. Furthermore, we show that the spatial variability of the abatement achieved at a given carbon price is large, indicating that abatement cost heterogeneity is a fundamental feature in the design of a mitigation policy.

1272,Water Quality Co-Effects of Greenhouse Gas Mitigation in U.S. Agriculture,"This study develops first-order estimates of water quality co-effects of terrestrial greenhouse gas (GHG) emission offset strategies in U.S. agriculture by linking a national level agricultural sector model (ASMGHG) to a national level water quality model (NWPCAM). The simulated policy scenario considers GHG mitigation incentive payments of $25 and $50 per tonne, carbon equivalent to landowners for reducing emissions or enhancing the sequestration of GHG through agricultural and land-use practices. ASMGHG projects that these GHG price incentives could induce widespread conversion of agricultural to forested lands, along with alteration of tillage practices, crop mix on land remaining in agriculture, and livestock management. This study focuses on changes in cropland use and management. The results indicate that through agricultural cropland about 60 to 70 million tonnes of carbon equivalent (MMTCE) emissions can be mitigated annually in the U.S. These responses also lead to a 2% increase in aggregate national water quality, with substantial variation across regions. Such GHG mitigation activities are found to reduce annual nitrogen loadings into the Gulf of Mexico by up to one half of the reduction goals established by the national Watershed Nutrient Task Force for addressing the hypoxia problem.",2005-08-01,10.1007/s10584-005-5925-0,"['Pattanayak, Subhrendu K.', 'McCarl, Bruce A.', 'Sommer, Allan J.', 'Murray, Brian C.', 'Bondelid, Timothy', 'Gillig, Dhazn', 'DeAngelo, Benjamin']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-005-5925-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

On a productive site in south-central Illinois (U.S.A.), experimental interplantings of European black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.) and black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) were established and maintained under a factorial combination of two initial densities and two thinning regimes. This study evaluated the growth response of the alder component of this system. Although alder consistently overtopped walnut, alder mortality began to increase dramatically during the seventh growing season and was nearly complete following the nineteenth growing season. Mean alder cumulative dry mass through year 14 ranged from 19.05 to 58.62 Mg/ha among initial density and thinning treatments. Carbon sequestered in useable bolewood constituted approximately 25 of total biomass. The productivity of the interplanted alder was comparable to that of native forests while constituting only a portion of the stand and without negatively impacting walnut growth or bole quality.

1274,Impact of Human Activities on Carbon Dioxide (CO_2) Emissions: A Statistical Analysis,"The balance of evidence suggests a perceptible human influence on global ecosystems. Human activities are affecting the global ecosystem, some directly and some indirectly. If researchers could clarify the extent to which specific human activities affect global ecosystems, they would be in a much better position to suggest strategies for mitigating against the worst disturbances. Sophisticated statistical analysis can help in interpreting the influence of specific human activities on global ecosystems more carefully. This study aims at identifying significant or influential human activities (i.e. factors) on CO_2 emissions using statistical analyses. The study was conducted for two cases: (i) developed countries and (ii) developing countries. In developed countries, this study identified three influential human activities for CO_2 emissions: (i) combustion of fossil fuels, (ii) population pressure on natural and terrestrial ecosystems, and (iii) land use change. In developing countries, the significant human activities causing an upsurge of CO_2 emissions are: (i) combustion of fossil fuels, (ii) terrestrial ecosystem strength and (iii) land use change. Among these factors, combustion of fossil fuels is the most influential human activity for CO_2 emissions both in developed and developing countries. Regression analysis based on the factor scores indicated that combustion of fossil fuels has significant positive influence on CO_2 emissions in both developed and developing countries. Terrestrial ecosystem strength has a significant negative influence on CO_2 emissions. Land use change and CO_2 emissions are positively related, although regression analysis showed that the influence of land use change on CO_2 emissions was still insignificant. It is anticipated, from the findings of this study, that CO_2 emissions can be reduced by reducing fossil-fuel consumption and switching to alternative energy sources, preserving exiting forests, planting trees on abandoned and degraded forest lands, or by planting trees by social/agroforestry on agricultural lands.",2005-03-01,10.1007/s10669-005-3093-4,"['Salam, Md.

1277,Designing Energy Conservation Voluntary Agreements for the Industrial Sector in China: Experience from a Pilot Project with Two Steel Mills in Shandong Province,"China faces a significant challenge in the years ahead to continue to provide essential materials and products for a rapidly growing economy while addressing pressing environmental concerns. China's industrial sector consumes about 70% of the nation's total energy each year and is heavily dependent on the country's abundant, yet polluting, coal resources. Industrial production locally pollutes the air with emissions of criteria pollutants, uses scarce water and oil resources, emits greenhouse gases contributing to climate change, and produces wastes. Fostering innovative approaches that are tailored to China's emerging market-based political economy to reduce the use of polluting energy resources and to diminish pollution from industrial production is one of the most important challenges facing the nation today. The use of Voluntary Agreements as a policy for increasing energy-efficiency in industry, which has been a popular approach in many industrialized countries since the early 1990s, is being tested for use in China through a pilot project with two steel mills in Shandong Province. The pilot project was developed through international collaboration with experts in China, the Netherlands, and the U.S. Designing the pilot project involved development of approaches for energy-efficiency potential assessments for the steel mills, targetsetting to establish the Voluntary Agreement energy-efficiency goals, preparing energy-efficiency plans for implementation of energy-saving technologies and measures, and monitoring and evaluating the project's energy savings.",2005-01-01,10.1007/1-4020-3356-7_11,"['Price, L.', 'Worrell, E.', 'Sinton, J.']",The Handbook of Environmental Voluntary Agreements,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/1-4020-3356-7_11,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

The development of the model was motivated by the need to analyze international energy and environmental issues such as climate change, using a detailed, technology rich modeling framework. We then present three different types of application. First, the model is applied to conduct the cost-effectiveness analysis of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission abatement, whereby constraints on CO_2 emissions are added to the base case formulation. The model then computes the cost-efficient response of the energy system to these emission targets. Second, we address the issue of “who pays”’ for emission reductions (whereas the cost-effictiveness analysis addressed the “who acts” issue). More precisely, we use the model to devise and evaluate certain allocation rules for attributing initial emission rights to regions in a cap-and-trade system. Third, we use World MARKAL in a cost-benefit mode, i.e. we augment the model with damage costs resulting from climate change, and run the integrated model without any pre-set targets on emissions or concentration. We then analyse cooperative and non-cooperative decisions by regions when confronted to the threat of damages.

1279,Sensitivity Analysis of Emissions Corridors for the 21st Century,"We investigate the sensitivity of emissions corridors for the 21st century to various factors that are currently under debate in the climate change arena. Emissions corridors represent the range of admissible emissions futures that observe some predefined guardrails on the future development of the human-climate system. They are calculated on the conceptual and methodological basis of the tolerable windows approach. We assess the sensitivity of the corridors to the choice of time-resolved as well as intertemporally aggregated guardrails that exclude an intolerable amount of climate change on the one hand and unbearable mitigation burdens on the other. In addition, we investigate the influence of climate sensitivity on the corridors. Results show a large dependence of emissions corridors on the choice of guardrails and the value of climate sensitivity T _2CO _2. If the guardrail on climate change is specified in terms of a maximum admissible global mean temperature increase T _max to be observed at any time, the size of the corridors is predominantly determined by a climate impact resilience parameter κ= T _max/ T _2CO _2. As κ is varied from values below 0.5 to values above 1.5, we move from cases where no emissions profile whatsoever can observe all guardrails, to cases where no significant emissions reduction seems necessary given the range of emissions scenarios for the 21st century. The limits on admissible mitigation efforts influence predominantly the timing and the economic viability of emissions reductions. A large mitigation flexibility allows for ‘wait then run’ emissions paths, while low flexibility asks for a significantly more prudent approach.",2004-10-01,10.1023/B:CLIM.0000044615.75251.02,"['Kriegler, Elmar', 'Bruckner, Thomas']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/B:CLIM.0000044615.75251.02,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

Enhancing Agriculture’s Potential to Sequester Carbon: A Framework to Estimate Incentive Levels for Reduced Tillage","The objectives of this study are to develop and test a framework to estimate the cost of enhancing agriculture’s potential as a carbon sink through the implementation of reduced tillage productive systems. A major factor inhibiting the adoption of reduced tillage practices is the additional risk perceived by farmers and its effect on net revenues. The expected utility model provides a useful means for evaluating risk–return tradeoffs of agricultural production systems. Incentive levels required to induce implementation of reduced tillage practices are calculated using estimated certainty equivalents. The framework developed is applied to eight case studies across the United States. Results indicate that in the Corn Belt, the required incentive payment for corn/soybeans would have to be $10.20 and $8.30 per acre for poorly drained and well-drained soils, respectively. Continuous corn incentive payments for poorly drained soils were found to be $40.40 and $26.70 for well-drained soils. In the central Great Plains, an incentive level of $14.60 per acre was required for continuous sorghum. Although the mean yields for conventional and reduced tillage practices are fairly close in this case, the higher costs associated with no-till sorghum result in the high incentive level. In the wheat/fallow and wheat/sorghum/fallow rotations of the western Great Plains, the yields associated with no-till were higher than intensive till. Thus, incentive levels near $6.00 per acre are the result of higher costs of no-till in these rotations. In the Mississippi River Corridor region, results show that the switch from corn/soybean to the same no-till rotation would require an incentive level of $7.90 per acre.",2004-07-01,10.1007/s00267-003-9133-2,"['Torre Ugarte, Daniel G.

1282,International Emission Trading and the Cost of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Mitigation and Sequestration,"The deployment of carbon capture and sequestration (CC&S) technologies is greatly affected by the marginal cost of controlling carbon emissions (also the value of carbon, when emissions permits are traded). Both the severity and timing of emissions limitations and the degree to which emissions limitation obligations can be traded will affect the value of carbon and thereby the timing and magnitude of CC&S technology deployment. Emissions limits that are more stringent in the near term imply higher near-term carbon values and therefore encourage the local development and deployment of CC&S technologies.Trade in emissions obligations lowers the cost of meeting any regional or global emissions limit and so affects the rate of penetration of CC&S technologies. Trade lowers the marginal value of carbon and CC&S penetration in high cost regions and raises the marginal value of carbon and CC&S penetration in low cost regions. The net impact on the world CC&Stechnologies depends on whether their increased use in low-cost regions exceeds the reduced use in high-cost regions.In the long term, CC&S technologies must not only remove carbon but permanently sequester it. If reservoirs are not permanent, then the emissions and costs of control are merely displaced into the future. The paper presents quantitative estimates for the impacts of trade in emissions limitation obligations on the timing, magnitude, and geographic distribution of CC&S technologies and the marginal and total costs of carbon control.",2004-06-01,10.1023/B:CLIM.0000025747.12101.37,"['Scott, Michael J.', 'Edmonds, James A.', 'Mahasenan, Natesan', 'Roop, Joseph M.', 'Brunello, Anthony L.', 'Haites, Erik F.']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/B:CLIM.0000025747.12101.37,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

1285,Potential Soil C Sequestration on U.S. Agricultural Soils,"Soil carbon sequestration has been suggested as a means to help mitigate atmospheric CO_2 increases, however there is limited knowledge aboutthe magnitude of the mitigation potential. Field studies across the U.S. provide information on soil C stock changes that result from changes in agricultural management. However, data from such studies are not readily extrapolated to changes at a national scale because soils, climate, and management regimes vary locally and regionally. We used a modified version of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) soil organic C inventory method, together with the National Resources Inventory (NRI) and other data, to estimate agricultural soil C sequestration potential in the conterminous U.S. The IPCC method estimates soil C stock changes associated with changes in land use and/or land management practices. In the U.S., the NRI provides a detailed record of land use and management activities on agricultural land that can be used to implement the IPCC method. We analyzed potential soil C storage from increased adoption of no-till, decreased fallow operations, conversion of highly erodible land to grassland, and increased use of cover crops in annual cropping systems. The results represent potentials that do not explicitly consider the economic feasibility of proposed agricultural production changes, but provide an indication of the biophysical potential of soil C sequestration as a guide to policy makers. Our analysis suggests that U.S. cropland soils have the potential to increase sequestered soil C by an additional 60–70 Tg (10^12g) C yr^− 1, over present rates of 17 Tg C yr^−1(estimated using the IPCC method), with widespread adoption of soil C sequestering management practices. Adoption of no-till on all currently annually cropped area (129Mha) would increase soil C sequestration by 47 Tg C yr^−1. Alternatively, use of no-till on 50% of annual cropland, with reduced tillage practices on the other 50%, would sequester less – about37 Tg C yr^−1. Elimination of summer fallow practices and conversionof highly erodible cropland to perennial grass cover could sequester around 20 and 28Tg C yr^−1, respectively. The soil C sequestration potentialfrom including a winter cover crop on annual cropping systems was estimated at 40Tg C yr^−1. All rates were estimated for a fifteen-yearprojection period, and annual rates of soil C accumulations would be expected to decrease substantially over longer time periods. The total sequestration potential we have estimated for the projection period (83 Tg C yr^−1) represents about 5% of 1999total U.S. CO_2 emissions or nearly double estimated CO_2 emissionsfrom agricultural production (43 Tg C yr^−1). For purposes ofstabilizing or reducing CO_2 emissions, e.g., by 7% of 1990 levels asoriginally called for in the Kyoto Protocol, total potential soil C sequestration would represent 15% of that reduction level from projected 2008 emissions(2008 total greenhouse gas emissions less 93% of 1990 greenhouse gasemissions). Thus, our analysis suggests that agricultural soil C sequestration could play a meaningful, but not predominant, role in helping mitigate greenhouse gas increases.",2003-04-01,10.1023/A:1022888832630,"['Sperow, M.', 'Eve, M.', 'Paustian, K.']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1022888832630,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer

Fluxes of CO_2, CH_4 and N_2O ranged widely. The highest CO_2 emission occurred in August, whereas almost 90% of the whole year emission occurred in the growing season. But the variations of CH_4 and N_2O fluxes did not show any clear patterns over the one-year-experiment. During a daily variation, the maximum CO_2 emission occurred at 16:00, and then decreased to the minimum emission in the early morning.

1289,Long-term Scenarios based on AIM Model,"In order to respond to climate change, it is essential to describe possible future trajectories of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in terms of both nonintervention and intervention strategies. This chapter analyzes long-term GHG emissions scenarios according to alternative development paths for the world and major regions, based on the nonintervention emissions scenarios quantified by the Asian-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM). AIM has been revised and applied to the quantification of story lines for scenarios of socioeconomic development, and GHG emissions from energy use, land use changes, and industrial production processes are simulated. A wide range of mitigation policies have been adopted as responses to climate change. The results show that to achieve stabilization at a different GHG concentration level, it is essential to have a policy package to reach the target concentration level, rather than a single policy. Energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy introduction make a key contribution to the reduction of GHG emissions as a result of such a policy package. The mitigation costs could be small without a significant reduction in economic growth. The developing world could substantially reduce GHG emissions compared with nonintervention scenarios with sufficient knowledge transfer from the developed countries.",2003-01-01,10.1007/978-4-431-53985-8_2,"['Morita, Tsuneyuki', 'Jiang, Kejun', 'Masui, Toshihiko', 'Matsuoka, Yuzuru', 'Rana, Ashish']",Climate Policy Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-4-431-53985-8_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1290,Criteria for Evaluation of Burden-sharing Rules in International Climate Policy,"This article presents nine criteria for assessing, comparing, and ranking burden-sharing rules and conceptual frameworks used in climate policy negotiations and agreements. Three of the criteria are concerned with fairness principles and six criteria are operational requirements. The application of these criteria is illustrated in the context of six different burden-sharing schemes. The Multi-sector Convergence approach and the Triptych approach received highest average score of the six schemes. The Brazilian proposal received a similar total score, but unevenly distributed with a high score on fairness principles and low score on operational requirements. The European Union member countries employed the Triptych approach when they differentiated their national abatement targets prior to the 1997 Kyoto meeting. The Multi-sector Convergence approach was developed in a joint ECN (Netherlands Energy Research Foundation) and CICERO (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research – Oslo) project. It is a sector-based, global approach that comprises convergence of per capita emissions at the same level in all countries. Sector-based approaches have a distinct advantage compared to other approaches because they reflect the economic structure of countries rather well. Such approaches could play a useful role in future climate policy negotiations, not the least in discussions on binding climate targets for developing countries.",2002-09-01,10.1023/A:1021370606451,"['Torvanger, Asbjørn', 'Ringius, Lasse']",International Environmental Agreements,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1021370606451,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1291,Costs of greenhouse gas abatement: meta-analysis of post-SRES mitigation scenarios,"Economic analyses have produced widely differing estimates of the economic implications of policies for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, ranging from high costs to modest benefits. The main reason for the differences appears to be differences in approaches and assumptions. This paper analyzes the extent to which the post-SRES^1 (after the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) model results for the global costs of GHG mitigation can be explained by the model’s characteristics and the assumptions adopted. The research applies meta-analysis methodology combined with scatter plots of the data to identify the ranges of the results and outlying data points. A database of scenarios and results was compiled for the post-SRES scenarios, which has the major advantage that all seven models for which suitable data are available have been run using the same, independently defined scenarios. The results are strongly clustered, with only a few results outside the range of −4% to 0% gross domestic product (GDP), with a strong correlation between CO_2 reduction and GDP reduction. A set of model characteristics is found to be highly significant (1% level), explaining some 70% of the variance. The main conclusion is that all modeling results regarding “GDP costs of mitigating climate change” should be qualified by the key assumptions leading to the estimates. The treatment of these assumptions can lead to the mitigation being associated with increases in GDP or with reductions.",2002-06-01,10.1007/BF03354027,"['Barker, Terry', 'Köhler, Jonathan', 'Villena, Marcelo']",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/BF03354027,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas emissions mitigation"")",springer
1292,Towards global climate change mitigation: assessment of an afforestation option for Nigeria,"This paper assesses the potential of an intensive afforestation program as a measure of reducing the atmospheric concentration of carbon in Nigeria. The results presented are based on the recently completed Nigerian Country Studies Program on Climate Change Mitigation. A comprehensive mitigation analysis process (COMAP) model was employed to carry out detailed cost/benefit evaluation of the mitigation option. The end-use based scenario adopted was considered the most appropriate strategy to sustainably implement the mitigation option in Nigeria. The analyses showed that the country could significantly reduce net carbon emission while at the same time meet all her essential domestic wood needs, if approximately 7.5×10^6 ha of wasteland could be committed to an afforestation program over the 40 year period of projection. The initial cost of establishing such forest plantations, taking cognisance of the opportunity cost of land averaged at about US$500/ha, or in carbon terms, a unit cost of about $13 per tonne of carbon. In terms of carbon flow, if all the end-product based plantations considered ( i.e. fuelwood, poles, pulpwood, sawlogs and veneer) were fully established and maintained, it was estimated that by the year 2030, the total carbon stored in the afforested land would be about 638.0×10^6 t of carbon with an annual incremental rate of 16.0×10^6 t of carbon. Other economic indicators ( i.e. net present value of benefits, present value of costs and benefit for reduced atmospheric carbon) when evaluated showed that the afforestation option could be economically viable even when the investment capital was discounted at rates ranging from 9 to 33 percent for different wood products. It should be noted, however that implementation of such a program would require huge sums of money and a high degree of commitment on the part of Federal, State and Local governments if the associated financial, social and environmental benefits were to be derived.",2002-03-01,10.1023/A:1014528326762,"['Siyanbola, W.

1294,The Kyoto Protocol Emission Allocations: Windfall Surpluses for Russia and Ukraine,"The emission targets adopted in the Kyoto Protocol^1 far exceed thelikely level of emissions from Russia and Ukraine. These countries could selltheir surplus if the Protocol is followedand industrialized countries establish an international emission tradingsystem. Critics have condemned the potentialsale and dubbed the surplus ‘hot air’ because it does not represent anyreduction in emissions below the level thatwould have occurred anyway. Using the most recent, comprehensive regionalscenarios^2 for the emissions of carbon dioxide from the energysystem, we estimate that during the Protocol's2008–2012 ‘budget period’ the surplus will range from 9 MtC (milliontons of carbon) to 900 MtC for Russia andfrom 3 MtC to 200 MtC for Ukraine. Even scenarios with high economic growthand carbon-intensive technologies donot exhaust the surplus before the budget period. In the central (‘middlecourse’) scenario, the total carbon surplusexceeds 1000 MtC and is worth 22 to 170 billion U.S. dollars (4 to 34 billionU.S. dollars per year). This flow ofrevenues, which could exceed Russian earnings from natural gas exports($10 billion in 1997^3), is comparable with the projectedtotal investmentsof the Russian energy system for 2008–2012.

In this paper, we briefly describe two top-down models that were adapted for India and show some key results from them. Working with more than one model gives us a better understanding of the differences in model structures and puts us in a good position for appreciating the differences in results from these models due to this fact. We project the long-term energy and emission trajectories from the global model (ERB) and the national model (SGM) and come to a conclusion that India’s energy system will remain largely dependent on coal in BAU case and is open to change under a regime of carbon taxes towards less carbon-emitting fuels like gas and renewables.

1298,Selling Clean Air,"In 1997 Costa Rica created a new kind of environmental bond to be introduced in the international financial markets, becoming the first country to issue environmental bonds. The bonds, called Greenhouse Gas Emission Mitigation Certificate, aim to sell the world the clean air generated by Costa Rican forests. The scheme is based on the air purifying process of trees through their fixation of carbon dioxide. The bonds’ value depends on the amount of carbon dioxide fixed, using cubic meters of wood as a measurement unit. Several difficulties have been faced: setting a price basis (measurement of carbon dioxide fixed), creating market value (property rights, global agreements, value-creating schemes), and avoiding moral hazard problems (verification process). The objective of the project is to channel its revenue to the territorial consolidation and funding of national parks. In addition, the scheme recognizes the market value of a positive externality, increasing the likelihood of applying market solutions to the world’s environmental problems. This paper studies: (a) the theoretical background behind the carbon bonds; (b) the original scheme proposed by Costa Rica and the global and local requirements of the scheme; (c) the implementation problems faced by the program and; (d) the preliminary results of the project.

1299,Evolving an Industrial Digital Ecosystem: A Transformative Case of Leather Industry,"Advances in information technology have made delivering e-content easier to subject experts and to publish on the Web with minimal technical skills and assistance. The development of multimedia e-Learning content is no more labour-intensive process, requiring a team of Web designers and developers responsible for the technical development of these resources, thereby limiting its widespread adoption. Tools such as Adobe Captivate, Camtasia, Snap, Articulate, Lectora, etc., provide an easy way of developing e-contents. This exercise has triggered the idea of creating a knowledge system for an industry, namely leather industry. Digital libraries are large organized collection of digitized objects comprising of texts, images, graphs, data which in new technical terms are referred to as “Big Data”. Well-defined digital software has the potential to disseminate this information worldwide through Internet technologies. The emergence of World Wide Web makes the unprecedented volumes of data freely available to the entire society. This helps in building a domain-specific knowledge portal. The digital economy ( also called the Internet economy , the new economy , or the Web economy ) is an economy based on digital technologies, including communication networks (the Internet, Intranets, and Extranets), computers, software, and other related technologies. The digital infrastructures provide a global platform over which people and organizations interact, communicate, collaborate, and search for information. Creating new sources of revenue, rationalizing cost structures, enhancing the speed of technology adaptation are considered to be the three wheels of digital ecosystems. Knowledge management is about creating an environment where information can be readily shared. This information is not just the text information but also includes the data at the unit level generated out of research endeavours. Creating a learning organization culture is critical. The Web can now integrate learning and mission-critical business applications while delivering timely knowledge to each desktop. The end result is a knowledge management structure which includes an inventory of knowledge objects and a system in which these can be shared. This is an approach paper to illustrate the content development for a few aspects in leather industry, taking advantage of tools available and a portraying schematically the knowledge portal for this industry. The paper considers knowledge management system (KMS) and the IT tools for leather and allied industry and networking of academic institutes with industries to create knowledge hub and technology innovation centre using digital ecosystem eventually leading to digital transformation.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-981-10-7515-5_18,"['Anantharaman, Latha', 'Sridharan, M.

1300,Ethics in Education for Sustainable Finance,"In order to achieve the UN’s SDGs which was adopted in 2015, demand for affluent private investments compatible with ESG factors is growing in international communities. Given the lack of evidence on higher performance and cheaper cost of green financial products than conventional products, to change peoples’ mind-set toward long-termism is a prerequisite for developing sustainable finance, so that they consider benefits of future generation and the people outside their own communities with a mind of altruism, when making financial decisions. In this respect, ethics can play key roles. Financial education needs to be upgraded to incorporate it. “Financial education for sustainability” is a very new concept. However, there are early attempts to link financial education with sustainable finance in Europe, while lack of active involvement of EU institutions is an obstacle for such activities to spread. On the other hand, Japan has a centralized platform for financial education and formalized ethics classes at schools, although relatively low level of the financial literacy among the citizens needs to be overcome. This chapter explores to clarify the standpoints of the two jurisdictions for achieving this new social challenge. Academic literature directly related is limited in this area. That said, valuable insights and implications can be derived from classic and contemporary work on ethics in finance, in the sense that they touch upon importance of moral education. How to incorporate altruism in traditional financial education is an imperative to establish a firm basis for developing sustainable finance on it.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-00001-1_13-1,"['Kaneko, Jutaro']",Handbook on Ethics in Finance,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-00001-1_13-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon greenhouse gas emissions"")",springer
1301,Climate,"There is no doubt that climate change nowadays is considered one of the hottest spots worldwide. These changes in climate penetrated all fields in our life including agriculture, soil, water, air, etc. and climate has a deciding role in all agricultural systems. The distribution of crops in different geographical regions and the selection of cropping patterns mainly depend on climate. All plant growth stages including seed germination and its growth, flowering, fruiting, and ripening are also mainly controlled by different climatic elements (e.g., moisture, temperature Temperature and day length). Therefore, the cultivation and management of cultivated crops require a proper weather and suitable climatic conditions. Due to the mismanagement of soil and burning fossil fuels, emissions of greenhouse gases have alarmingly increased. In Egypt, climate changes have three serious dimensions representing in the threat of sinking of the Nile Delta, water crisis Water crisis and the decrease in crop production. Therefore, this chapter will focus on climate and its parameter variations in Egypt as well as expected effects from these changes mainly on water crisis and the production of crops.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-95516-2_5,"['El-Marsafawy, Samia', 'Bakr, Noura', 'Elbana, Tamer', 'El-Ramady, Hassan']",The Soils of Egypt,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-95516-2_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon greenhouse gas emissions"")",springer
1302,Case Studies of Ecological Restoration and Conservation Strategies for Marshes and Peatlands,"Wetlands are being degraded and destroyed at a faster rate than any other ecosystem on earth. Many key functions and values that wetlands provide have already been lost. Since the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, the crucial benefits of wetland restoration and creation have been recognized by an increasing number of countries around the world. The goal of this chapter is to illuminate the ecological restoration and conservation strategies for marshes and peatlands using case studies. General principles and guidelines based on experience under different settings can offer a useful starting point for new restoration projects. We summarize eight key principles applied to different stages of a restoration project, from early planning to post-implementation monitoring that can be used widely. These principles focus on scientific and technical issues, but as in all environmental management activities, the importance of community perspectives and values should not be overlooked. We present an in-depth look at four different wetland restoration case studies. We acknowledge that every restoration project is unique and that there is no “cookbook” for restoring wetlands. Even so, these case studies provide a general outline regarding the historical causes of wetland degradation, the goal-setting required for successful restoration, and the details involved in significant wetland restoration efforts across different sites. In addition, the valuable lessons and challenges faced by the Chinese government in response to these case studies will be discussed.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-14861-4_9,"['Zhu, Xiaoyan', 'Jiang, Ming', 'Yuan, Yuxiang', 'Verhoeven, Jos T.

An intermittent micro-aeration control system was used to control methane emissions from an integrated vertical-flow constructed wetland (IVCW) to treat agricultural domestic wastewater pollution in this study. The optimized intermittent micro-aeration conditions were a 20-min aeration time and 340-min non-aeration time, 3.9 m^3 h^−1 aeration intensity, evenly distributed micro-aeration diffusers at the tank bottom, and an aeration period of every 6 h. Methane flux emission by intermittent micro-aeration was decreased by 60.7% under the optimized conditions. The average oxygen transfer efficiency was 26.73%. The control of CH_4 emission from IVCWs was most strongly influenced by the intermittent micro-aeration diffuser distribution, followed by aeration intensity, aeration time, and water depth. Scaling up of IVCWs is feasible in rural areas by using intermittent micro-aeration control as a mitigation measure for methane gas emissions for climate change.",2018-08-01,10.1007/s11356-018-2226-5,"['Liu, Xiaoling', 'Zhang, Ke', 'Fan, Liangqian', 'Luo, Hongbing', 'Jiang, Mingshu', 'Anderson, Bruce C.', 'Li, Mei', 'Huang, Bo', 'Yu, Lijuan', 'He, Guozhu', 'Wang, Jingting', 'Pu, Aiping']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-018-2226-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon greenhouse gas emissions"")",springer
1304,Study on the removal of hormones from domestic wastewaters with lab-scale constructed wetlands with different substrates and flow directions,"Eight wastewater samples from a university campus were analysed between May and July of 2014 to determine the concentration of 14 natural and synthetic steroid hormones. An on-line solid-phase extraction combined with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (on-line SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS) was used as extraction, pre-concentration and detection method. In the samples studied, three oestrogens (17β-estradiol, estrone and estriol), two androgens (boldenone and testosterone), three progestogens (norgestrel, progesterone and norethisterone) and one glucocorticoid (prednisone) were detected. The removal of hormones was studied in primary and secondary constructed wetland mesocosms. The porous media of the primary constructed wetlands were palm tree mulch. These reactors were used to study the effect of water flow, i.e. horizontal (HF1) vs vertical (VF1). The latter was more efficient in the removal of 17β-estradiol (HF1: 30%, VF1: 50%), estrone (HF1: 63%, VF1: 85%), estriol (100% both), testosterone (HF1: 45%, VF1: 73%), boldenone (HF1:-77%, VF1: 100%) and progesterone (HF1: 84%, VF1: 99%). The effluent of HF1 was used as influent of three secondary constructed wetland mesocosms: two double-stage vertical flow constructed wetlands, one with gravel (VF2gravel) and one with palm mulch (VF2mulch), and a mineral-based, horizontal flow constructed wetland (HFmineral). VF2mulch was the most efficient of the secondary reactors, since it achieved the complete removal of the hormones studied with the exception of 17ß-estradiol. The significantly better removal of BOD and ammonia attained by VF2mulch suggests that the better aeration of mulch favoured the more efficient removal of hormones.",2018-07-01,10.1007/s11356-017-9307-8,"['Herrera-Melián, José Alberto', 'Guedes-Alonso, Rayco', 'Borreguero-Fabelo, Alejandro', 'Santana-Rodríguez, José Juan', 'Sosa-Ferrera, Zoraida']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-017-9307-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon greenhouse gas emissions"")",springer

1308,Methane emissions proportional to permafrost carbon thawed in Arctic lakes since the 1950s,"Permafrost thaw exposes previously frozen soil organic matter to microbial decomposition. This process generates methane and carbon dioxide, and thereby fuels a positive feedback process that leads to further warming and thaw^ 1 . Despite widespread permafrost degradation during the past ∼40 years^ 2 , 3 , 4 , the degree to which permafrost thaw may be contributing to a feedback between warming and thaw in recent decades is not well understood. Radiocarbon evidence of modern emissions of ancient permafrost carbon is also sparse^ 5 . Here we combine radiocarbon dating of lake bubble trace-gas methane (113 measurements) and soil organic carbon (289 measurements) for lakes in Alaska, Canada, Sweden and Siberia with numerical modelling of thaw and remote sensing of thermokarst shore expansion. Methane emissions from thermokarst areas of lakes that have expanded over the past 60 years were directly proportional to the mass of soil carbon inputs to the lakes from the erosion of thawing permafrost. Radiocarbon dating indicates that methane age from lakes is nearly identical to the age of permafrost soil carbon thawing around them. Based on this evidence of landscape-scale permafrost carbon feedback, we estimate that 0.2 to 2.5 Pg permafrost carbon was released as methane and carbon dioxide in thermokarst expansion zones of pan-Arctic lakes during the past 60 years. Warming thaws permafrost, releasing carbon that can cause more warming. Radiocarbon, soil carbon, and remote sensing data suggest that 0.2–2.5 Pg of carbon has been emitted from permafrost as CO_2 and CH_4 around Arctic lakes since the 1950s.",2016-09-01,10.1038/ngeo2795,"['Walter Anthony, Katey', 'Daanen, Ronald', 'Anthony, Peter', 'Schneider von Deimling, Thomas', 'Ping, Chien-Lu', 'Chanton, Jeffrey P.', 'Grosse, Guido']",Nature Geoscience,https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2795.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon greenhouse gas emissions"")",springer
1309,Stable forest carbon stocks support current assumption of biogenic carbon neutrality in the case of European-manufactured beverage cartons,"Purpose Life cycle assessments (LCAs) of forest-based products, such as beverage cartons, generally demonstrate lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuel-based alternatives and often contain the implicit assumption that removal of carbon dioxide (CO_2) by a growing forest and emission of CO_2 at the end of a product’s life cancel each other out such that the net emission is zero. This study aims to test the validity of this assumption of biogenic CO_2 neutrality in relation to beverage cartons by examining whether carbon stocks of the source forests are stable. The fact that over 95 % of the cartonboard used in their manufacture is sourced from the boreal forests of Sweden and Finland provides a scenario with a straightforward relationship between forest and product thus avoiding issues surrounding the complexities of global supply chains. Methods The reviewed LCAs conclude that beverage cartons have lower greenhouse gas emissions than alternatives, although non-forest-derived components such as plastic caps and aluminium laminate often contribute disproportionately to those emissions. We discuss issues surrounding the assumption of biogenic CO_2 neutrality and explore the factors that influence carbon stocks in boreal forests that supply much of the raw material for beverage cartons. Results and discussion An analysis of published rates of carbon sequestration in the managed forests of Finland and Sweden reveals that forest carbon is stable under current harvest rates. This lends support to the assumption of biogenic CO_2 neutrality in the case of beverage cartons produced from these forests. We conclude that greenhouse gas emissions would not change if an LCA included forest carbon. However, future forest dynamics and thus carbon stocks are predicted to alter in response to climate change, for example, which will have knock on effects for greenhouse gas emissions from packaging derived from forests. Conclusions This review combines current thinking on inclusion of forest carbon in LCAs with an analysis of issues that will influence carbon stocks in managed forests. Although current assumptions of biogenic CO_2 neutrality are valid in the case of European-manufactured beverage cartons, we argue that this assumption needs to be explicitly addressed in LCAs. While there is no accepted methodology for integrating biogenic forest carbon uptake into LCA, our assessment of current trends in forest carbon stocks allows for assumptions of biogenic CO_2 neutrality to be tested, although our approach may not be practical for more complex supply chains.",2016-01-01,10.1007/s11367-015-0989-1,"['O’Sullivan, Odhran S.', 'Hopkinson, Lisa', 'Crockatt, Martha E.', 'Laird, Paul', 'Bebber, Daniel P.']",The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11367-015-0989-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon greenhouse gas emissions"")",springer
1310,Methane and Carbon Dioxide in the Sediment of a Eutrophic Reservoir: Production Pathways and Diffusion Fluxes at the Sediment–Water Interface,"The estimated diffusion fluxes of methane (CH_4) and carbon dioxide (CO_2) at the sediment–water interface in the Rzeszów Reservoir in southeastern Poland are presented. The relevant studies were conducted during 2009, 2010, and 2011. Calculated fluxes ranged from 0.01 to 2.19 mmol m^−2 day^−1 and from 0.36 to 45.33 mmol m^−2 day^−1 for methane and carbon dioxide, respectively. While the values for calculated diffusion fluxes of methane are comparable with those reported for other eutrophic reservoirs, much higher values were obtained here for carbon dioxide. The resulting values of δ^13C-CH_4 and the fractionation coefficients between methane and carbon dioxide (αCH_4-CO_2) suggest that methane in the sediment of the Rzeszów Reservoir is produced by acetate fermentation, while the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic process is of successively greater importance with increasing depth. In the top layer of the sediment, 24–72 % of CO_2 came from methanogenesis, while the contribution made by the degradation of organic matter by methanogenesis to CO_2 was greater in the deeper layer.",2015-02-05,10.1007/s11270-014-2268-3,"['Gruca-Rokosz, Renata', 'Tomaszek, Janusz A.']","Water, Air, & Soil Pollution",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11270-014-2268-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon greenhouse gas emissions"")",springer
1311,Modeling Differential Growth in Switchgrass Cultivars Across the Central and Southern Great Plains,"Switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum L. ) has been recognized as a potential biofuel crop, because it is adapted to a wide range of environmental and climatic conditions. Zones of adaptation for many switchgrass cultivars are well documented and attributed to local adaptation to the temperature and photoperiod at the location of origin. The objective of this study is to develop cultivar-specific growth parameters for the Agricultural Land Management and Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) model based on location of origin and use these parameters to predict the biomass production of two lowland cultivars (Alamo and Kanlow) and two upland cultivars (Blackwell and Cave-in-Rock) in the central and southern Great Plains (TX, AR, LA, OK, KS, and MO). The plant parameters adjusted for each cultivar’s origin include average growing season temperature (22–27 °C), photoperiod at growth onset (11.46–13.12 h), maximum number of heat units (1,500–2,300), maximum leaf area index (6–12), and light extinction coefficient (0.33–0.50). The absolute difference between the average simulated and measured yields across all seven field locations for each cultivar is less than 0.5 Mg ha^−1. Performance of the cultivar-specific parameters varies by location, but the parameters do a reasonable job of estimating the average yield (less than 15 % difference) of each cultivar for a majority of field locations. In addition, regional simulations of the four cultivars each show realistic spatial variation in yield across the central and southern Great Plains. The parameters derived in this project for the ALMANAC model provide a tool for optimizing choice of switchgrass cultivar on different soils, in different climates, and with different management across large geographic regions.",2014-12-01,10.1007/s12155-014-9450-8,"['Behrman, Kathrine D.', 'Keitt, Timothy H.', 'Kiniry, James R.']",BioEnergy Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12155-014-9450-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon greenhouse gas emissions"")",springer
1312,A review on the mechanism and affecting factors of nitrous oxide emission in constructed wetlands,"Constructed wetlands (CWs) are considered important sources of nitrous oxide (N_2O). Various reports in the literature indicate that CWs have high N_2O emission rates. The release of N_2O from CWs treating wastewater emissions range from −16.7 to 188 mg N_2O m^−2day^−1. N_2O in CWs is produced mainly by nitrification, denitrification, nitrifier denitrification, and nitrate-ammonification. Denitrification is considered the major source of N_2O under most conditions. In recent years, two main methods of sampling N_2O gas in CWs have been employed, including the headspace equilibration technique and the closed static chambers technique. N_2O emission may be affected by various operating parameters and environmental conditions. One of the main environmental factors affecting the removal of nitrogen in CWs is dissolved oxygen, which affects nitrification and denitrification processes, thus greatly influencing N_2O emission. CW gas dynamics is affected mainly by season and weather conditions, especially temperature and moisture. Aquatic plants, flow regime, oxidation–reduction potential, nitrate concentration, C/N ratio and other factors can affect N_2O emission in CWs.",2013-04-01,10.1007/s12665-012-1900-z,"['Huang, Lei', 'Gao, Xu', 'Guo, Jinsong', 'Ma, Xiaoxia', 'Liu, Ming']",Environmental Earth Sciences,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12665-012-1900-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon greenhouse gas emissions"")",springer
1313,Increasing Food Production Sustainably in a Changing Climate: Understanding the Pressures and Potential,Australian agriculture is faced with the dilemma of increasing food production for a growing domestic and world population while decreasing environmental impacts and supporting the social and economic future of regional communities. The challenge for farmers is compounded by declining rates of productivity growth which have been linked to changes in climate and decreasing investment in agricultural research. The answer must lie in understanding the ecological functionality of landscapes and matching management of agricultural systems and use of natural resources to landscape capacity in a changing climate. A simplified mixed grain and livestock farm case study is used to illustrate the challenges of assessing the potential for shifts in land allocation between commodities to achieve sustainable intensification of nutrition production. This study highlights the risks associated with overly-simplistic solutions and the need for increased investment in research to inform the development of practical strategies for increasing food production in Australian agro-ecosystems while managing the impacts of climate change and addressing climate change mitigation policies.,2013-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-4484-8_13,"['Henry, Beverley', 'Conant, Richard', 'Carter, John', 'Droulez, Veronique', 'Grace, Peter']",Food Security in Australia,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-4484-8_13,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon greenhouse gas emissions"")",springer
1314,Understanding the metabolism of urban-rural ecosystems,"A Multi-sectoral Systems Analysis (MSA) methodology is presented as a tool for identifying the level of importance of flows of energy and materials (water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon) as they pass through an anthropogenically manipulated system. That system comprises a web of processes, across a total of five industrial sectors: water, forestry, food, energy and waste management. Given the heterogeneous nature and quality of data sources, the propagation of data uncertainty is considered through a Regionalized Sensitivity Analysis (RSA) procedure, based on the Monte Carlo simulation approach. The MSA reveals the advantages of studying different material cycles simultaneously, in addition to interpreting them individually, while gaining insight into the magnitude of the associated flows. The proposed framework is illustrated for a case study of the Upper Chattahoochee Watershed, in which parts of Metro Atlanta are located. Results show that natural flows are predominant in the water and energy cycles. Direct human manipulations of water, i.e., withdrawals for public supply and power generation, are less than 25% of the amount received as precipitation. Solar input is 200 times the total demand for electricity. Apart from sun-light, gasoline for transportation is the flow with the largest content of energy; it is responsible for providing 71% of the total demand of fuels for uses other than power generation. In contrast, cycles of nutrients such as N and C are strongly related to the flows of fuels, mainly coal and natural gas. In a second tier, fertilizer use and the poultry industry in the region are significant for the use of nitrogen. Phosphorus fluxes are similarly dominated by the food sector and, as a consequence, to a lesser extent by the water sector, because of water’s role as a waste-conveyance medium.",2012-12-01,10.1007/s11252-012-0241-8,"['Villarroel Walker, R.', 'Beck, M.

1315,Life cycle assessment (LCA) applied to the process industry: a review,"Purpose Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is a well-established analytical method to quantify environmental impacts, which has been mainly applied to products. However, recent literature would suggest that it has also the potential as an analysis and design tool for processes, and stresses that one of the biggest challenges of this decade in the field of process systems engineering (PSE) is the development of tools for environmental considerations. Method This article attempts to give an overview of the integration of LCA methodology in the context of industrial ecology, and focuses on the use of this methodology for environmental considerations concerning process design and optimization. Results The review identifies that LCA is often used as a multi-objective optimization of processes: practitioners use LCA to obtain the inventory and inject the results into the optimization model. It also shows that most of the LCA studies undertaken on process analysis consider the unit processes as black boxes and build the inventory analysis on fixed operating conditions. Conclusions The article highlights the interest to better assimilate PSE tools with LCA methodology, in order to produce a more detailed analysis. This will allow optimizing the influence of process operating conditions on environmental impacts and including detailed environmental results into process industry.",2012-09-01,10.1007/s11367-012-0432-9,"['Jacquemin, Leslie', 'Pontalier, Pierre-Yves', 'Sablayrolles, Caroline']",The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11367-012-0432-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon greenhouse gas emissions"")",springer
1316,Participatory foresight analysis of the cash crop sector at the regional level: case study from southwestern France,"Following the request of local stakeholders, a multidisciplinary group of experts was formed to implement a foresight analysis of the cash crop sector in the Midi-Pyrénées region. The group developed a four-step multidisciplinary and participatory methodology that defined the objectives, established a shared diagnosis of the issue raised in the regional cash crop sector, implemented a foresight analysis, and then created a graphical summary. Three types of working groups (steering, restricted, and expanded) were involved with well-assigned tasks. The dynamic interactions between the different groups of stakeholders and scientists and the use of graphics and maps as a medium to identify critical areas, such as zones in which production or environmental issues, are declining or evolving, enabled a shared view of regional problems. The main contribution of this paper is the presentation of a participative methodology that enabled co-construction of three shared scenarios based on the combination of five major uncertainties: (i) change in agricultural markets and international trade; (ii) urbanization and regional planning; (iii) changing patterns of consumption and product processing; (iv) environmental issues in public policies; and (v) ability of farmers to implement innovative tools and methods.",2011-12-01,10.1007/s10113-011-0232-y,"['Bergez, Jacques-Eric', 'Carpy-Goulard, Françoise', 'Paradis, Sylvie', 'Ridier, Aude']",Regional Environmental Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10113-011-0232-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon greenhouse gas emissions"")",springer

Carbon Management Response Curves: Estimates of Temporal Soil Carbon Dynamics
","Measurement of the change in soil carbon that accompanies a change in land use (e.g., forest to agriculture) or management (e.g., conventional tillage to no-till) can be complex and expensive, may require reference plots, and is subject to the variability of statistical sampling and short-term variability in weather. In this paper, we develop Carbon Management Response (CMR) curves that could be used as an alternative to in situ measurements. The CMR curves developed here are based on quantitative reviews of existing global analyses and field observations of changes in soil carbon. The curves show mean annual rates of soil carbon change, estimated time to maximum rates of change, and estimated time to a new soil carbon steady state following the initial change in management. We illustrate how CMR curves could be used in a carbon accounting framework while effectively addressing a number of potential policy issues commonly associated with carbon accounting. We find that CMR curves provide a transparent means to account for changes in soil carbon accumulation and loss rates over time, and also provide empirical relationships that might be used in the development or validation of ecological or Earth systems models.",2004-08-01,10.1007/s00267-003-9108-3,"['West, Tristram O.', 'Marland, Gregg', 'King, Anthony W.', 'Post, Wilfred M.', 'Jain, Atul K.', 'Andrasko, Kenneth']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-003-9108-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon greenhouse gas emissions"")",springer

1321,Climate agreements and India: aligning options and opportunities on a new track,"The Climate negotiations in Copenhagen in December 2009 witnessed the emerging power of Brazil, South Africa, India, and China (BASIC). Although still focussed on domestic development goals, BASIC countries have made important steps toward a greater engagement in the global climate agenda. For India, the shift was marked by a voluntary, but conditional, target of reducing emission intensity, away from the past normative position based on “equal per capita,” emissions entitlements. The new track aims at finding cost-effective mitigation strategies that align national development goals and climate actions. This paper examines the mitigation potential of a domestic sustainable development policy using a suite of integrated assessment models. The long-term goal is to keep temperature increase below 2°C. This article shows that it is possible to match domestic development goals and climate mitigation. Win–win options exist and side benefits—in terms of energy security and local pollution—are important. However, development policies are not sufficient to achieve the desired emissions reductions. We find that it is necessary to introduce a constraint on the carbon budget. The price of carbon that emerges is however much lower than in a conventional mitigation scenario. Finally, this paper proposes to shift the negotiations away from the current climate-centric focus toward “development,” in order to reduce conflicts and deliver greater global and national benefits.",2011-07-15,10.1007/s10784-011-9158-6,"['Shukla, P.

1322,Towards a more effective climate policy on international trade,"In the literature on the attribution of responsibilities for greenhouse gas emissions, two accounting methods have been widely discussed: production-based accounting (PBA) and consumption-based accounting (CBA). It has been argued that an accounting framework for attributing responsibilities should credit actions contributing to reduce global emissions and should penalize actions increasing them. Neither PBA nor CBA satisfy this principle. Adapting classical Ricardian trade theory, we consider ex post measurement and propose a scheme for assigning credits and penalties. Their size is determined by how much CO_2 emissions are saved globally due to trade. This leads to the emission responsibility allotment (ERA) for assigning responsibilities. We illustrate the differences between ERA and PBA and CBA by comparing their results for 41 countries and regions between 1995–2009. The Paris Agreement (COP21) proposed new market mechanisms; we argue that ERA is well suited to measure and evaluate their overall mitigation impact. Partners who actually reduce global emissions can be penalized under carbon accounting methods based on production or consumption give an idea of responsibility. Here the authors propose a new framework, emission responsibility allotment that penalizes/credits those that increase/decrease global emissions.",2020-02-28,10.1038/s41467-020-14837-5,"['Dietzenbacher, Erik', 'Cazcarro, Ignacio', 'Arto, Iñaki']",Nature Communications,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14837-5.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit emissions"")",springer

1324,"Carbon recovery following selective logging in tropical rainforests in Kalimantan, Indonesia","Background The knowledge gap regarding post-logging carbon recovery by increased growth is becoming more crucial to understand the significant contribution of forest to climate change mitigation. We assessed the ability of tropical forests in Indonesia to recover carbon following conventional logging. We evaluated carbon re-growth of 10,415 trees in permanent sample plots (PSPs) in East Kalimantan. Four different post-harvesting silvicultural treatments including liberation, refining, thinning, and control were applied in the PSPs. We estimated the carbon recovery period using three different scenarios of total carbon losses due to logging. In the first scenario, we used an existing factor of logging damage and increased it for assuming the range of carbon losses due to different logging practices. Results Under the existing conventional logging practice, the concession annually emits 51.18 tC∙ha^− 1, of which 16.8% are extracted from the forest as raw timber, 38% are logging losses, and 45.2% are emissions due to infrastructure development for logging operation. Increasing the logging damage factor two and three times led to an increase in carbon emission to 70.76 and 90.34 tC∙ha^− 1, respectively. The recovery time of the aboveground carbon is 26 years in Scenario 1, 36 years in Scenario 2, and 46 years in Scenario 3. We found no significant effect of the silvicultural treatment type on carbon recovery, but significant effect of the sites was observed. Conclusions We found that the time taken to restore the carbon to the level found in undisturbed forests is considerably longer than the current intervention cycles. The time needed to recover biomass and carbon-stock noticeably depends on the intensity of logging interventions, demonstrating the benefits of using improved harvesting e.g., reduced impact logging to reduce emissions. The study found that site variability has a significant effect on the carbon recovery time. Different silvicultural treatments, on the other hand, have no effect on the recovery time. The study suggests that it is not appropriate to establish an intervention cycle based on arbitrary choice; the time between interventions must be based on logging losses and site specific growth potential to ensure sustainable management of forests.",2019-09-02,10.1186/s40663-019-0195-x,"['Butarbutar, Tunggul', 'Soedirman, Soeyitno', 'Neupane, Prem Raj', 'Köhl, Michael']",Forest Ecosystems,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40663-019-0195-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit emissions"")",springer
1325,A systematic review on the aboveground biomass and carbon stocks of Indian forest ecosystems,"Background Tropical forests play a crucial role as source and sink in global carbon cycle. Development and other anthropogenic activities have led to degradation of forest land, and ultimately, it results in loss of biodiversity and increases concentration of CO_2 in atmospheres. Therefore, there is urgent need to estimate regional and national level carbon stock for making forest-based policies and strategies for mitigation of CO_2. Patchy and sporadic information is available on biomass and carbon stock of Indian forests. The paper presents a systematic review and comprehensive account of studies conducted in different forest types in India. Result There are six major forest types found in India consisting of 15 groups and other subgroups with peculiar characteristics. Methodologies used by researchers for biomass/carbon stock estimation are destructive, nondestructive, tree inventories data, species-specific biomass estimation, and remote sensing. Majority of estimates are based on nondestructive allometric equation approach. Studies showed positive correlation between tree species, diameter at breast height, and biomass/carbon stock. Small- and medium-sized growing trees, invasive species, mixed forest, Agroforestry, and Agrosilviculture also play an important role in atmospheric carbon assimilation. The results of diverse forest carbon stock studies are broadly categorized in North, Central, and Southern India. Present review will be helpful for developing conservation policies and decision to increase carbon stock and also REDD+ program for particular forest ecosystem. Conclusion The systematic literature review was carried out to gather and summarize information from different studies conducted on forest ecosystems and quantification methods used for biomass estimation and carbon stock in different forests types and states of India. In general, great variability occurs in aboveground biomass and carbon stock on account of climatic and geographic differences. To obtain good and accurate estimations, following nondestructive approach, species-specific density-based equations are required from different habitats and also in relation to degradation status of forests. As such regional volume equations would increase error of estimations.

1327,An appraisal on commercial farming of Kappaphycus alvarezii in India: success in diversification of livelihood and prospects,"There is an urgent need for diversifying livelihood of low-income artisanal fishermen due to rapidly dwindling fishery resources. CSIR-Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute takes pride in being first for pioneering Kappaphycus alvarezii cultivation, heralding an era of commercial seaweed farming in India. The invention of liquefying fresh seaweed biomass to obtain two products in an integrated manner, one being a granular residue rich in κ-carrageenan and the other being sap rich in potash and micronutrients (ca. 2 % w / v ), with proven efficacy has provided a boost to commercial farming. The production has been substantially increased from 21 dry tonnes in 2001 to 1490 dry tonnes in 2013 with concomitant purchase value of <4.5 to 35 Rs kg^−1 (dry). India is fast emerging as important production center in Southeast Asia for K. alvarezii production with estimated 765,000 man-days of employment, having annual turnover of around Rs 2 billion. At present, commercial farming is carried out following three techniques, namely floating bamboo raft, tube net, and longline method of which former two are widely practiced. The cultivation activity is well established in southern state of Tamil Nadu and progressing rapidly to other areas namely Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. The socioeconomic benefits accrued in this project are overwhelmingly positive, but evidence-based policies are required for addressing prevailing environmental issues.

1328,Assessing the impact of ETS trading profit on emission abatements based on firm-level transactions,"The EU Emission Trading System (ETS) is the oldest and currently the largest carbon market in the world, but its purpose of stimulating carbon emissions via trading profits remains unexamined. Based on the complete firm-level transaction records of the EU ETS Phases I and II, here we show that the participating firms’ trading profits and their emission abatements are positively correlated, and the correlation becomes stronger in Phase II than Phase I. Specifically, we observe that non-linearity exists in the correlation; higher firm-level emission abatements can realize larger trading profits. This pattern affects the market fairness, though it may be helpful to incentivise emission abatements. The correlation is more regulated in Phase II than it is in Phase I, thereby indicating that the Phase II is more mature. We also observe that the state-level abatements are largely driven by industrial giants. Carbon emission trading is an important market-based policy instrument to reduce GHG emission using reward-punishment mechanism.

1330,Linking with Uncertainty: The Relationship Between EU ETS Pollution Permits and Kyoto Offsets,"Carbon offsets from the Kyoto Flexible Mechanisms can be used by firms in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for compliance in lieu of EU allowances, making these carbon assets interchangeable. We offer an explanation of the price spread using a structural model of the price for Certified Emissions Reductions that combines three features: a limit for the use of Kyoto offsets within the EU ETS; a disconnect between the current price of offsets and their marginal cost of production for institutional reasons; and uncertainty about future supply and demand of offsets. Our model expresses the offset price as an average of the EU allowance price and an offset’s outside value, weighted by the probability of a binding import limit. Using a monthly series of the United Nation’s Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation about offset supply and demand, we provide empirical support for our theory of offset price formation. Counterfactual simulations suggest that the price process is dominated by uncertainty.",2019-10-01,10.1007/s10640-019-00346-7,"['Hintermann, Beat', 'Gronwald, Marc']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-019-00346-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1331,Labor Market Distortions and Welfare-Decreasing International Emissions Trading,"Using a multi-region, multi-sector computable general equilibrium model, this paper analyzes the effects of international emissions trading (IET) with a focus on labor market distortions. We construct four separate models with several different labor market specifications: (1) a model without labor market distortions; (2) a model with taxinteraction effects in the labor market; (3) a model with a minimum wage; and (4) a model in which a wage curve determines wages. We use these models to analyze how the effects of IET change according to model specification. The main results from the analysis are as follows. First, we found that IET generates gains for all participants in the model without labor market distortions. Second, even in the models with labor market distortions, importers of emissions permits are highly likely to benefit. Conversely, we show that the possibility of a welfare loss from IET is not as small for exporters of permits. In particular, in the minimum wage and wage curve models, we found that the exporters of emissions permits are likely to be disadvantaged. However, this also depends on the region in question. For example, China is likely to suffer under IET, whereas Russia is likely to benefit. Finally, if we implement policies to alleviate labor market distortion simultaneously with emissions regulation, all regions receive benefit from IET.",2019-09-15,10.1007/s10640-018-00317-4,"['Takeda, Shiro', 'Arimura, Toshi H.', 'Sugino, Makoto']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-018-00317-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1332,Behavioral sources of the demand for carbon offsets: an experimental study,"Voluntary carbon markets present firms and individuals with the opportunity to offset all or part of their carbon footprints. We report on a controlled laboratory experiment to understand the behavioral motivations driving the purchase of carbon offsets, in addition to investigating the effect of the introduction of voluntary carbon markets on emission-causing activities. We find a stable demand for offsets when the price is sufficiently low. Behavior is, however, heterogeneous. Individuals with a high (low) personal-responsibility index increase their offset purchases as their own damage (total damages) increases, but do not condition their offsetting behavior on the total damages (own damage) generated. We also show that, when individuals trade in competitive markets, the availability of offsets does not affect the total damages generated. Introduction of carbon offsets increases individuals’ earnings by eliminating some of the damages ex-post, but does not increase economic efficiency.",2019-09-01,10.1007/s10683-018-09601-y,"['Kuhn, Kai-Uwe', 'Uler, Neslihan']",Experimental Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10683-018-09601-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1333,The sensitivity of the costs of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) to future socioeconomic drivers and its implications for mitigation policy design,"Climate change mitigation policies for the land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) sector are commonly assessed based on marginal abatement cost curves (MACC) derived from optimization models or engineering approaches. Yet, little is known about the space of validity of MACCs and how they are influenced by changes in main underlying drivers. In this study, we apply the Global Forest Model (G4M) to explore the sensitivity of MACCs to variation of socioeconomic drivers of deforestation, afforestation, and forest management activities. Particularly, three key factors are considered: (I) wood price, as an indicator of timber market developments; (II) agricultural land price, as a proxy representing the developments on agricultural markets; and (III) corruption coefficient, representing the progress in institutional development and measuring abatement costs use efficiency. The results indicate that the MACCs are more sensitive to the corruption coefficient than to agricultural land price and wood price. Furthermore, we find that the MACCs are more robust with high carbon dioxide (CO_2) price and that the sensitivity of the MACCs is higher at low CO_2 prices. In general, it can be concluded that when assessing medium-term mitigation policies characterized by low CO_2 prices, MACCs need to be developed in-line with institutions currently in place. When designing long-term mitigation policy characterized by high CO_2 prices, the role of the analyzed drivers in MACCs estimation is less important.",2019-08-15,10.1007/s11027-018-9817-9,"['Gusti, Mykola', 'Forsell, Nicklas', 'Havlik, Petr', 'Khabarov, Nikolay', 'Kraxner, Florian', 'Obersteiner, Michael']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-018-9817-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1334,"Behavioral and Experimental Agri-Environmental Research: Methodological Challenges, Literature Gaps, and Recommendations","Insights from behavioral and experimental economics research can inform the design of evidence-based, cost-effective agri-environmental programs that mitigate environmental damages and promote the supply of environmental benefits from agricultural landscapes. To enhance future research on agri-environmental program design and to increase the speed at which credible scientific knowledge is accumulated, we highlight methodological challenges, identify important gaps in the existing literature, and make key recommendations for both researchers and those evaluating research. We first report on four key methodological challenges—underpowered designs, multiple hypothesis testing, interpretation issues, and choosing appropriate econometric methods—and suggest strategies to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we emphasize the need for more detailed planning during the experimental design stage, including power analyses and publishing a pre-analysis plan. Greater use of replication studies and meta-analyses will also help address these challenges and strengthen the quality of the evidence base. In the second part of this paper, we discuss how insights from behavioral and experimental economics can be applied to improve the design of agri-environmental programs. We summarize key insights using the MINDSPACE framework, which categorizes nine behavioral effects that influence decision-making (messenger, incentives, norms, defaults, salience, priming, affect, commitment, and ego), and we highlight recent research that tests these effects in agri-environmental contexts.

The environment is a uniform-price sealed-bid auction for 2 identical objects, followed by a free-form bargaining resale market, with one positive-value bidder, and either one or two speculators who may choose simultaneously whether to enter the auction. We show that the bidder accommodates speculators by reducing demand in the auction and subsequently purchasing in the resale market, which encourages entry by speculators. The presence of multiple speculators induces each speculator to enter less often, but increases competition in the auction and the auction price. Speculators earn positive profits on average, except when multiple speculators enter the auction.",2019-06-15,10.1007/s10683-018-9564-5,"['Pagnozzi, Marco', 'Saral, Krista J.']",Experimental Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10683-018-9564-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1336,Double Free-Riding in Innovation and Abatement: A Rules Treaty Solution,"In addressing climate change, both abatement itself and the innovation of superior abatement technologies are exposed to free-riding. To examine this double free-riding problem, we develop a multi-country model with an international market for emission permits and licenses for abatement technologies. We show that the two problems are mutually reinforcing. To address the double free-riding problem we propose a rules treaty for innovation and abatement that consists of two rules, an allocation rule and a refunding rule. The allocation rule determines the share of issued emission permits that each country can directly allocate to its domestic firms, while the remainder is handed over to an international agency. The refunding rule determines how the agency’s revenues from selling these permits to firms are redistributed. A fraction is given to those countries that successfully develop superior abatement technologies provided they license the technology free of charge to all countries. The remaining revenues are redistributed to all countries. These rules can approximate globally optimal abatement and innovation levels.",2019-06-01,10.1007/s10640-018-0270-8,"['Gersbach, Hans', 'Oberpriller, Quirin', 'Scheffel, Martin']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-018-0270-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1337,Prices Versus Quantities Versus Hybrids in the Presence of Co-pollutants,"We investigate the optimal regulation of a pollutant given its abatement interaction with another pollutant under asymmetric information about firms’ abatement costs. We take a policy-relevant, second-best approach by assuming that the co-pollutant is regulated exogenously, but perhaps not efficiently. Our focus is on optimal policy choice in this setting, and we derive rules for determining whether a pollutant should be regulated with an emissions tax, an emissions market, or a market with price controls, given the regulation of its co-pollutant. We find that the policy choice for a pollutant is unaffected by its interaction with a co-pollutant that is controlled with a fixed number of tradable permits, because changes in emissions of the primary pollutant do not affect aggregate emissions of the co-pollutant. However, when a co-pollutant is controlled with a tax, the policy choice for the primary pollutant must account for its effect on expected co-pollutant damage through changes in the variance of co-pollutant emissions. Consequently, standard conclusions about the environmental policy choice problem must be modified in this case. Our results have important implications for designing policies for greenhouse gases under uncertainty.",2019-06-01,10.1007/s10640-018-0266-4,"['Stranlund, John K.', 'Son, Insung']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-018-0266-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

The permit allocation rule is the main treatment variable, with permits being fully auctioned or grandfathered. The experimental results show significant investment under both allocation rules in the presence of ex ante uncertainty over the actual investment outcome.

1339,Investment perspectives on costs for air pollution control affect the optimal use of emission control measures,"Abstract Cost-effective air pollution emission control has been in focus for decades in international air pollution regulations. Despite large observed emission reductions for many air pollutants, environmental and human health problems persist and more efforts are needed. However, some stakeholders are concerned that the costs for remaining emission control measures are prohibitively high. There are several reasons for concern, and one can be the difference in investment perspectives—i.e. costs of borrowing and time constraints—held by stakeholders. By using the integrated assessment model GAINS, we study whether differences in investment perspectives of Nordic stakeholders influence measures selected for cost-effective emission control and can motivate concerns for high costs of emission control. We distinguish the control cost calculations between a social planner perspective and a corporate perspective and apply these to the GAINS model database on emission control measures. A cost-minimized selection of measures in 2030 is then calculated for increasing environmental and health ambitions for both perspectives. The results show an irregular pattern, but for a range of ambition levels the corporate perspective affects the selection of measures and implies surplus costs for the Nordic social planner of up to 120 million € per year. This is 36% more expensive than the costs of the social planners’ selection. Conversely, from a corporate perspective the social planners’ selection can imply cost increases of up to 180 million €. We therefore suggest that control of investment perspective effects should be standard in analysis of cost-effective air pollution measures.

1340,"Which performs better under trader settings, double auction or uniform price auction?","A marketable permit system (MPS) has been suggested as a solution to environmental problems. Although the properties of MPSs under non-trader settings, in which each player is exclusively either a seller or a buyer, are well documented, little research has explored how MPSs perform under trader settings, in which each player can be both a seller and a buyer. We institute two auctions of trader settings in MPS experiments: a double auction (DA) and a uniform price auction (UPA). We then evaluate and compare their performances both with each other and with those under non-trader settings. The main results are as follows: DAs under trader settings perform much worse than do DAs under non-trader settings, whereas UPAs perform well, regardless of the trader and non-trader settings. UPAs are more efficient and generate more stable prices than do DAs under trader settings, and a considerable proportion of trades in DAs under trader settings consist of “flips” that could be considered speculation or errors. Thus, UPAs are likely to work better than DAs under trader settings.",2019-03-15,10.1007/s10683-018-9585-0,"['Kotani, Koji', 'Tanaka, Kenta', 'Managi, Shunsuke']",Experimental Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10683-018-9585-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1341,"Economics of Global Funds: United Nations Specialized Funds and Other Crypto, Crowdfunding, Green Funds","This final chapter of the book expands the discussion of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to other global funds. Four important old and new global funds are reviewed: United Nations funds and specialized programs, crowdfunding, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and various green funds such as the European Union’s CO2 permit. The review shows that many UN specialized programs share similar characteristics with the GCF and have overlapping areas of funding. The GCF is a type of crowdfunding for the global climate programs in which member nations are donors, but a majority of the crowdfunding projects are politically motivated appealing to a certain segment of the society. The Bitcoin system is transparent in creating and determining the value of a bitcoin through currency exchanges, but the GCF system relies on the GCF Board’s implicit determination of the value of a ton of CO2-equivalent emissions. Many green funds such as the EU’s emission trading scheme or the sulfur dioxide allowance trading in the US can be adapted to match the GCF’s project funding allocations, but the global scope of the GCF works would still remain the biggest challenge.

1343,Methods of Environmental Risk Management for Land Contamination Problems: Suggestions for Japan,"In Japan, the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act was enacted in 2002. Since then, implementation of the required countermeasures to tackle land contamination in urban areas has improved considerably. However, the pollution of soil on private land may spread undetected. Moreover, contaminated land may be left untreated because ridding soil of contamination is very expensive. Therefore, further countermeasures to reduce the environmental risk of land contamination in urban areas are necessary. This study’s purpose is to suggest methods of environmental risk management for urban land contamination in Japan. First, we consider sources of contamination, differentiating point sources and nonpoint sources, to evaluate how best to manage the environmental risk of land contamination. The characteristics of these two source types are explained through the concept of transaction costs. Second, we discuss how Japan has approached land contamination problems and adopted regulations since the period of high economic growth. We also briefly discuss foreign countries’ regulations. We then examine what kinds of typical environmental policy measures are effective in environmental risk management for land contamination. Finally, we suggest practical methods of environmental risk management for land contamination in urban areas. This requires efficient methods to reduce contamination with low transaction costs. In particular, the costs of monitoring and enforcing to reduce contamination caused by nonpoint sources are high. Therefore, it is important to manage these sources appropriately.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-981-13-7619-1_9,"['Ebisu, Miwa', 'Hagihara, Kiyoko']",Building Resilient Regions,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-13-7619-1_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

1345,Emission Trading with Fiscal Externalities: The Case for a Common Carbon Tax for the Non-ETS Emissions in the EU,"A government is fiscally constrained if it is unable to raise sufficient tax revenue to finance the first-best level of public spending. When involved in emission trading, a fiscally constrained government will potentially seek to close its fiscal gap through emission permit sales. This fiscal incentive therefore generates a fiscal externality in the permit market that is endogenous to the extent of fiscal constrainedness among the participating countries. Our theory explains how, and when, fiscal externalities may be expected to arise. Moreover, we show that in a permit market equilibrium with fiscal externalities, the initial allocation of emission permits between countries will affect: (1) the price of emission permits, (2) the global distribution of abatement effort, and (3) total greenhouse gas mitigation costs. This is contrary to the textbook model of emission permit markets. Our findings are especially relevant for the EU which is about to allow for trading in emission rights between EU member countries for all emissions outside the European Emissions Trading System.",2018-11-01,10.1007/s10640-017-0184-x,"['Andersen, Jørgen Juel', 'Greaker, Mads']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-017-0184-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1346,Non-linear Pass-Through of the CO2 Emission-Allowance Price onto Wholesale Electricity Prices,"This article considers the evidence for threshold effects in the relationship between electricity and emission-permit prices in France and Germany during the second phase of the EU ETS. Specifically, we compare linear and non-linear threshold models of electricity prices using the sample-splitting and threshold estimation approach in Hansen ( Econometrica, 64 575–603 2000 ). We find evidence of non-linear threshold effects in both countries. The estimated carbon-price thresholds are 14.94€ and 12.57€ in France and Germany respectively. The carbon-price threshold in France perfectly matches the well-known carbon spot-price structural break of October 2008. This is not the case for the carbon-price threshold in Germany. Further analysis reveals that carbon prices before October 2008 were not reflected in electricity prices in either country. This is mainly due to uncertainty about the future of the EU ETS that led electricity producers to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. After October 2008, French electricity producers passed the price of emission permits through to electricity prices in a linear way, while their German counterparts did so non-linearly. Finally, we suggest improvements to the design of the EU ETS. Our recommendations are to strengthen the price signal to make it more clear and reliable and provide sufficient incentives for energy transition.",2018-10-01,10.1007/s10666-018-9603-9,"['Ahamada, Ibrahim', 'Kirat, Djamel']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10666-018-9603-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

1348,The erratic behaviour of the EU ETS on the path towards consolidation and price stability,"The Kyoto Protocol envisages the use of various instruments to achieve emission reduction targets, one of which is the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), the most important market worldwide for CO_2 emission allowances. The volume of European Union Allowances traded represents over 45% of all the carbon dioxide generated by human activity within the continent. In its first two phases (2005–2012), the behaviour of the EU ETS was erratic, as a result of discretionary policies, an oversupply of allowances and reduced economic activity due to the global crisis. These factors caused excessively low prices that distorted the initial goals of achieving low-carbon solutions. From 2013, changes were made to the market regulation mechanisms in order to correct these structural deficiencies. Empirical analysis of daily prices in the two central phases of the market, following the pattern of ARCH and GARCH models, shows that the measures taken within the EU generated greater confidence and stability in the market and thus reduced volatility. Subsequent price behaviour, following a bullish path, has confirmed the success of the measures taken and their contribution to fulfilling emission reduction targets.",2018-10-01,10.1007/s10784-018-9411-3,"['Galán-Valdivieso, Federico', 'Villar-Rubio, Elena', 'Huete-Morales, María-Dolores']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-018-9411-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1349,Intertemporal Emission Permits Trading Under Uncertainty and Irreversibility,"This paper analyzes the effect of emission permit banking on clean technology investment and abatement under conditions where the stringency of the future cap is uncertain. We examine the problem of heterogeneous firms minimizing the cost of intertemporal emission control in the presence of stochastic future pollution standards and emission permits that are tradable across firms and through time. A firm can invest in clean capital (an improved pollution abatement technology) to reduce its abatement cost. We consider two possibilities: that investment is reversible or irreversible. Uncertainty is captured within a two period model: only the current period cap is known. We show that if banking is positive and marginal abatement costs are sufficiently convex, there will be more abatement and investment in clean technology under uncertainty than there would be under certainty and no banking. These results are at odds with the common belief that uncertainty on future environmental policy is a barrier to investment in clean capital. Moreover, under uncertainty and irreversibility, we find that there are cases where banking enables firms to invest more in clean capital.",2018-09-01,10.1007/s10640-017-0137-4,"['Pommeret, Aude', 'Schubert, Katheline']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-017-0137-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

Low volume trading in carbon financial instruments (CFI) can lead to disproportionately high levels of price discovery; however, the generated pricing has low-efficiency levels. This is associated with high levels of informed trades coupled with low levels of liquidity trades. Results obtained show evidence of higher trading volume per minute and higher price efficiency for after-hours when compared with regular trading hours (RTH). As a result of a higher proportion of informed trades, adverse selection costs for trades during the after-hours are significantly larger than those for trades during the regular trading day.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-72847-6_3,"['Ibikunle, Gbenga', 'Gregoriou, Andros']",Carbon Markets,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-72847-6_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

In this paper, we examine the key features of an optimal policy to manage environmental externalities that are both lagged and stochastic. We develop a two-period, two-polluter model and obtain closed-form solutions for optimal emissions levels under different combinations of damage functions and stochastic processes. These solutions show that it is not obvious whether greater control should be exerted on polluters that generate externalities with longer lags or on polluters that generate externalities with shorter lags. We find that the optimal ranking of polluters with respect to the length of the time lag associated with their externality will depend on (a) the discount rate, (b) conditional expectations of future states of the polluted resource, (c) persistence of the pollutant, and (d) initial conditions.",2017-11-01,10.1007/s10640-016-0026-2,"['Kuwayama, Yusuke', 'Brozović, Nicholas']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-016-0026-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

We compare the consequences of emission quotas and emission taxes under trade liberalization on location of two manufacturing sectors with different emission intensities and degrees of carbon leakage. With low trade costs, further trade liberalization increases global emissions by facilitating carbon leakage. Regulation by quotas leads to spatial sorting, resulting in less carbon leakage and less global emissions than regulation by taxes.",2017-08-01,10.1007/s10640-015-9991-0,"['Ishikawa, Jota', 'Okubo, Toshihiro']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-015-9991-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1354,Emission trading for air pollution hot spots: getting the permit market right,"Conventional emission permit markets are inefficient for non-uniformly mixed pollutants that create geographic ‘hot spots’ of different ambient emission concentrations and environmental damage. Economically efficient ambient concentration contribution markets involve difficult interactions among multiple markets that makes them practically infeasible. Extending economic theory by Muller and Mendelsohn (Am Econ Rev 99(5):1714–1739, 2009 . doi: 10.1257/aer.99.5.1714 ) and others about ‘getting the prices right’ through bilateral trading ratios, this paper introduces theoretical simplifications and a novel type of single permit market with a hybrid price-quantity instrument that addresses the dual heterogeneity of firm-specific abatement costs and regional variation in damage. This paper shows how to ‘get the market right’ robustly through simplicity, liquidity, and gradualism. Analytic solutions and simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the novel market concept. Also discussed is the potential applicability of the market design to interstate trading in the United States in the wake of the recently implemented Cross-State Air Pollution Rule .",2017-01-01,10.1007/s10018-015-0138-x,"['Antweiler, Werner']",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10018-015-0138-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1355,Market Power in Emission Permit Markets: Theory and Evidence from the EU ETS,"A well-known result about market power in emission permit markets is that efficiency can be achieved by full free allocation to the dominant firm. I show that this result breaks down when taking the interaction between input and output markets into account, even if the dominant firm perceives market power in the permit market alone. I then examine the empirical evidence for price manipulation by the ten largest electricity firms during phase I of the EU ETS. I find that some firms’ excess allowance holdings are consistent with strategic price manipulation, and that they cannot be explained by price speculation or by precautionary purchases to insure against uncertain future emissions. My results suggest that market power is likely to be an empirically relevant concern during the early years of emission permit markets.",2017-01-01,10.1007/s10640-015-9939-4,"['Hintermann, Beat']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-015-9939-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1356,Some Economics of International Climate Policy,"This chapter discusses economic aspects of international efforts to curb the global warming threat. The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol expired in 2012, which has until then been the dominant climate agreement although competing – or allegedly complement – international climate protection schemes like the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate also existed. While as of 5 April 2011, the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP) Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP) formally concluded its joint work, tangible preparations for a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol started at the climate conference in Montreal (comprising MOP and COP-11) in 2005. In Montreal, a new working group was established for the discussion of future commitments (after 2012). And at the COP-18 in Doha in 2012, an agreement on a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol for 2013–2020 could be reached. In this chapter, we describe the main features of Kyoto and APP schemes and their failure to establish an efficient global climate protection regime, and we elaborate on the disincentives for countries to commit to efficient climate protection efforts in an international agreement. In doing so we also take into account the growing importance of Adaptation to climate change adaptation to climate change in the international climate policy arena. The situation in international negotiations on climate change mitigation faced by national governments is depicted in game theoretic settings, and private ancillary benefits of climate policy are identified to raise the likelihood for countries joining an international agreement. Yet, it remains quite disputable to which extent ancillary benefits can be an impetus for more action in international climate policy. Finally, after dedicating a large part of the chapter to agreements, like the Kyoto Protocol, stipulating abatement quantities, alternative schemes are presented which were coined “price ducks” since they influence the effective prices of climate protection. By manipulating prices, e.g., via an international carbon tax, incentives are generated for producing higher climate protection levels. Recently, the so-called matching schemes influencing effective prices of climate protection raised much attention in the scientific literature. Such schemes may attenuate free- or easy-rider incentives in international climate policy and may even induce a globally efficient climate protection level.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_4,"['Pittel, Karen', 'Rübbelke, Dirk', 'Altemeyer-Bartscher, Martin', 'Otte, Sebastian']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-14409-2_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1357,Sixty Years of Economics: Some Lessons for the Future,"Economics is contextual and evolves. For this reason, in this chapter, I have selected some relevant milestones of a long period of 60 years. The choice, the questions and the conclusions are personal and probably controversial. The chapter begins with the great failure of the Economy: the gap in the distribution of wealth even in developed countries. It continues asking the following questions: What have we learned from the seventies crisis? What are we learning from the current crisis? What is wrong with Economics as a social science? Can Experimental Economics allow us to understand and accommodate the social complexity of the Economy? What is the scope of Artificial Economics? Finally, since Artificial Economics provides solutions to complex problems, can we export socially inspired methods to other areas of Management Engineering? I conclude that there are tools to improve Economics and to help us in designing proper institutional frameworks. However, solving the actual economic challenges will require changes in methods and institutions far beyond Economic Policy. The changes must be institutional and can not be delayed.

1358,Uncertainty and speculators in an auction for emissions permits,"Auctions have become popular as means of allocating emissions permits in the emissions trading schemes developed around the world. Mostly, only a subset of the regulated polluters participate in these auctions along with speculators, creating a market with relatively few participants and, thus, incentive for strategic bidding. I characterize the bidding behavior of the polluters and the speculators, examining the effect of the latter on the profits of the former and on the auction outcome. It turns out that in addition to bidding for compliance, polluters also bid for speculation in the aftermarket. While the presence of the speculators forces the polluters to bid closer to their true valuations, it also creates a trade-off between increasing the revenue accrued to the regulator and reducing the profits of the auction-participating polluters. Nevertheless, the profits of the latter increase in the speculators’ risk aversion.",2016-06-01,10.1007/s11149-016-9299-1,"['Haita-Falah, Corina']",Journal of Regulatory Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11149-016-9299-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1359,An Experimental Investigation of Hard and Soft Price Ceilings in Emissions Permit Markets,"Tradable emissions permits have been implemented to control pollution levels in various markets and represent a major component of legislative efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions. Because permits are supplied for a fixed level of pollution, allowing the market for permits to determine the price, price control mechanisms may be needed to protect firms from price spikes caused by fluctuations in the demand for permits. We test permit markets in an experimental laboratory setting to determine the effectiveness of several price control mechanisms, with special attention on the soft price ceiling. We focus on a static setting similar to some of the earliest experimental work focused on price ceilings. Results indicate that both permit supply adjustments and price ceilings (hard ceilings) effectively limit elevated prices in this setting. By contrast, reserve auctions to implement soft ceilings do not consistently control prices, especially when a minimum reserve permit price is applied. Furthermore, the grandfathering of permits allows permit sellers to realize significant welfare gains at the expense of buyers under a soft ceiling policy. Our results thus highlight several advantages of hard ceilings for controlling short term price increases.",2016-04-01,10.1007/s10640-014-9810-z,"['Perkis, David F.', 'Cason, Timothy N.', 'Tyner, Wallace E.']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-014-9810-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1360,Incentive-Based Policy Design for Pollution Control and Biodiversity Conservation: A Review,"This paper provides a succinct review of the main developments in the literature on incentive-based policy mechanisms in the contexts of pollution control and biodiversity conservation, dating from the early beginnings of the science in the 1960s. A focal point in the review is on the design features of these policy mechanisms. Key developments in policy design were originally established in controlling externalities arising from pollution and have since been extended to policy design tailored towards biodiversity conservation. Special emphasis is given to the spatial characteristics of the environmental problems underlying both pollution control and biodiversity conservation. The paper concludes by drawing some lessons and setting out elements of a future research agenda in both policy domains.",2016-04-01,10.1007/s10640-015-9996-8,"['Vries, Frans P.', 'Hanley, Nick']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-015-9996-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1361,The Case for an Emissions-Trading System to Help Resolve the Climate Change Crisis,"To deal adequately with the climate change crisis, an emissions-regulating system is required to help resolve the following policy goals: (i) ecological sustainability—which requires, among other things, stabilising the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases at no more than 450 ppm of CO_2-e; (ii) distributional equity—which involves efforts to narrow the income gap between rich and poor and to ensure the needy have access to basic necessities; and (iii) allocative efficiency—which requires a price to be assigned to greenhouse gas emissions to induce a shift away from fossil fuels; maximise the use value generated from the emission of greenhouse gases; and encourage the development and use of greenhouse gas-abatement technologies. The system must also be designed to resolve these policy goals in the above order. It is argued in this chapter that these requirements can only be satisfied by implementing an emissions-trading system. There are, however, many observers who believe that an emissions-trading system is inferior to an emissions tax. The preference for an emissions tax is based on a number of assertions. Following a brief outline of the key features of an effective emissions-trading system, this chapter repudiates these assertions and explains the many advantages that emissions-trading systems have over emissions taxes. Because of market imperfections and non-market barriers, assigning a price to greenhouse gas emissions via an emissions-trading system does not guarantee the realisation of all economically viable abatement potential. In response, this chapter concludes with complementary forms of government intervention to help a nation cost-effectively achieve its emissions targets.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-94-017-7502-1_7,"['Lawn, Philip']",Resolving the Climate Change Crisis,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-017-7502-1_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1362,A Post-2020 Protocol and Emissions-Trading Framework to Resolve the Climate Change Crisis,"This chapter outlines the various elements of a post-Kyoto protocol and the global emissions-trading framework that would accompany it. Built on a modified version of the existing Kyoto architecture and guided by the ecological economic principles of ecological sustainability, distributional equity, and allocative efficiency, the protocol recommended in this chapter includes provisions and reforms pertaining to: (i) the emissions cuts required to achieve a safe atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases; (ii) compliance institutions; (iii) border-tax adjustments; (iv) the treatment of land use, land-use change, and forestry activities; (v) the existing Kyoto flexibility mechanisms; (vi) the transfer of funds from high-GDP to low-GDP nations to assist the latter with their future mitigation and adaptation needs; (vii) the rudiments of a national emissions-trading system; and (viii) how national emissions-trading systems would be linked into a group-level system initially, and a single global system eventually. The chapter continues with a section showing that should countries make the transition to a qualitatively steady-state economy, very few would have difficulty meeting their emissions obligations. For those that might, which are likely to be the world’s poorest nations, they would be singled out and provided with additional financial assistance. The book concludes with the message that dealing with climate change will require greater government intervention in the future. Although it is important for governments to harness the efficiency-yielding benefits of markets, it is equally important for governments to preclude markets from resolving sustainability and distributional issues and exploit their spending and taxation powers, just as governments in high-GDP nations did in the immediate post-World War II period, to shift the global economy on the path required to resolve the climate change crisis.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-94-017-7502-1_10,"['Lawn, Philip']",Resolving the Climate Change Crisis,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-017-7502-1_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

1364,A Robust Noncooperative Meta-game for Climate Negotiation in Europe,"In this paper we define and solve a ‘robust game design’ problem that could be used to assess the fair sharing of the abatement burden among the 28 EU countries in their coming climate negotiations. The problem consists in finding a distribution of a global ‘safety emission budget’ for the panning period 2010–2050, among the 28 countries in such a way to obtain a balanced relative loss of welfare (computed in percent of the discounted consumption in the reference case) when the countries supply strategically their permit endowment on a permit trading system with full banking and borrowing. We assume that the countries play a noncooperative game, where the payoffs are constituted of the gains from the terms of trade plus the gains in the permit trading and minus the abatement cost, expressed as the compensative variation of income. These payoff functions are estimated from an ensemble of numerical simulations of a detailed CGE model, GEMINI-E3 representing the economic interactions among the 28 EU countries. To deal with the uncertainty introduced by the statistical emulation technique we propose to use the concept of robust equilibrium, where the results of robust optimization are exploited in the definition of an equilibrium solution, when the payoff is subject to uncertainties. A numerical illustration is performed and an interpretation of the impact of the robustification approach on the solution of the game design problem is provided.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-28014-1_15,"['Babonneau, Frédéric', 'Haurie, Alain', 'Vielle, Marc']",Advances in Dynamic and Evolutionary Games,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-28014-1_15,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

1367,Sustainable systems - game theory as a tool for preserving energy resources,"Background Mankind is highly dependent upon fossil fuels for its ever-increasing energy demands. The future supply is unreliable mainly due to the fact that it is a finite resource which is becoming more and more expensive to produce. As a reaction to this current threat and uncertainty, a mathematical model is developed in this study in order to identify more sustainable quantities. The main objective of this study was to provide companies with a tool to assist in the prevention of overproduction, in other words, to minimize unsalable production quantities and to preserve natural resources. Method Regression analysis, game theory - Cournot game. Results The study was carried out in cooperation with the Italian company PintInox, S. p. A., located in the Italian region of Lombardia. After the implementation of sustainability measurement metrics into the company's processes and the discovery of a profitable market niche (market principles applying value to sustainable development) for PintInox, S. p. A., a natural grouping (oligopoly) of Italian cutlery producers was identified. Entrance barriers posed by this group (oligopoly) are all kinds of inabilities to prove a verifiable concept of their Corporate Social Responsibility practices. Companies that failed to communicate their commitment regarding sustainable development to their business-to-business (B2B) partners cannot enter this oligopoly and are, consequently, excluded from markets placing value on sustainability principles. Based on economic effectiveness, the marketable output of every oligopoly member was calculated. Conclusions The desire to preserve natural resources is driven by incentives within the marketplace. These incentives were identified through the game theory. The companies firstly concentrate themselves on social responsibility and environmental safety and then, as oligopoly members, on economic effectiveness. The study reconfirms that also the economic dimension plays an important role in a ‘triple bottom line’ philosophy.",2015-02-12,10.1186/s13705-014-0030-8,"['Dolinsky, Martin']","Energy, Sustainability and Society",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13705-014-0030-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

R&D investments influence the future GHG abatement choices of both industrialized and developing countries. We distinguish between investments that reduce industrialized countries’ abatement costs and investments that reduce developing countries’ abatement costs. Unlike earlier contributions, we include global trading in emission permits. This changes the nature of the game. With global permit trading, industrialized countries should in many cases invest strategically in technologies that only reduce abatement costs at home. This comes in addition to investments abroad. Second, we show that R&D investments always decrease total emissions.

The experimental analysis is performed under varying market structures: firstly, in a market that is exclusive to compliance companies and subsequently, in a market that is open to both compliance and non-compliance entities. In line with theoretical models on irreversible abatement investment, the paper shows that regulated companies trade permits at a premium. Also, steep per unit penalties for excess emissions prompt early investments in irreversible abatement technologies. Further, the paper shows that by contributing to the permit demand and supply, non-compliance companies (i) enhance the exchange of permits, helping the system to achieve a zero-excess permit position, (ii) increase the price levels, but has no apparent effect on price variability.",2014-08-01,10.1007/s11149-013-9238-3,"['Taschini, Luca', 'Chesney, Marc', 'Wang, Mei']",Journal of Regulatory Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11149-013-9238-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1371,Using the allocation of emission permits for strategic trade purposes,"We show that the presence of transaction costs in emission permit markets challenges the common presumption that grandfathering permits corresponds to lump-sum transfers with no strategic effects on output. Fixed transaction-costs influence firms’ decision to participate in the permits market, while variable transaction-costs affect firms’ output choice by creating a wedge between buyers’ and sellers’ opportunity cost of using permits. Thus, permit grandfathering can be used as a strategic trade instrument even when firms are price takers in the permit markets.

In the traditional auction models, the basic assumption is that the government, i.e., the auctioneer, only pursues the maximum economic revenue. In this paper, we consider a hybrid auction-bargaining model, which gives new insights on how the government’s economic and social goals effect the equilibrium strategies. For this model, we find a symmetric bidding strategy equilibrium for the firms in a sealed bid auction form, which is closely related to the classical results in the auction. Our most important finding is that, compared with the classical auction mechanism, the final trading price is based on not only firm’s bidding strategy, but also the application quality of emission permits in the energy consumption market. The results also show that this auction-bargaining mechanism can alleviate distortion by excessive allowance in initial emission permits auction market and promote the social goals in both auction market and consumption market.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-07956-1_30,"['Ding, Lili', 'Wang, Xiaoling', 'Kang, Wanglin']",Algorithmic Aspects in Information and Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-07956-1_30,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

1377,Interactive Spatial Decision Support for Agroforestry Management,"Forest managers, stakeholders and investors want to be able to evaluate economic, social and environmental information in order to improve the outcomes of their decisions and enhance sustainable forest management. We propose a spatial information system that provides: (1) an approach to identifying the most beneficial locations for agroforestry projects based on the biophysical properties and evaluate its economic, social and environmental impact; (2) a simulation environment that enables evaluation via a simple dashboard and with the opportunity to perform straight forward sensitivity analysis for key parameters; (3) a tool to inform prospective investors of the potential and opportunities for integrated forest management; (4) a 3D interactive geographic visualization of the economic, social and environmental outcomes to facilitate direct understanding, also by non-experts. The presented tool intends to inform investors and improve forestry management decision-making, integrating the value of environmental services and collaborative decision making of multiple decision makers and stakeholders.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-08299-8_10,"['Freitas, André', 'Dias, Eduardo', 'Diogo, Vasco', 'Smits, Willie']",Geodesign by Integrating Design and Geospatial Sciences,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-08299-8_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1378,Western Water Markets: Effectiveness and Efficiency,"Most rivers throughout the western U.S. are fully appropriated. New municipal, industrial, recreational and environmental water demands will likely be met by reallocating water out of agriculture, the region’s largest user of water. The question is: how best to do so? Water markets have long been advocated by many as the answer to this question. This chapter begins with an overview of water allocation law and water markets in the West including a discussion of the various alternative market-based reallocation mechanisms being considered. A summary of recent literature on market activity in the West is followed by a detailed look at transactions in the Colorado River Basin.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-94-017-9081-9_16,"['Goemans, Christopher', 'Pritchett, James']",Water Markets for the 21st Century,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-017-9081-9_16,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1379,An experiment on emissions trading: the effect of different allocation mechanisms,"In theory, efficiency and compliance levels induced by an emission trading system should not depend on the initial allocation mechanism for permits in the absence of transaction costs. In a laboratory experiment we investigate this prediction by comparing frequent and infrequent auctioning as well as two different grandfathering schemes under market rules that closely resemble those of the European Union Emission Trading System. Our experimental results suggest that, contrary to theoretical predictions, the initial allocation procedure has the potential to affect efficiency of the final permit allocation. While we do not identify an effect of the initial allocation procedure itself (auction vs. grandfathering), we observe higher final efficiency after infrequent auctioning of permits than for frequent auctioning. Surprisingly, for a grandfathering scheme that distributes permits proportional to expected needs the high initial efficiency is substantially reduced by secondary market trading. An analysis of behavioral patterns shows that permit prices and abatement levels are initially substantially higher if permits are allocated by auction and we also find more over-banking as compared to the grandfathering treatments. Treatment differences diminish in the course of the experiment.",2013-12-01,10.1007/s11149-013-9222-y,"['Grimm, Veronika', 'Ilieva, Lyuba']",Journal of Regulatory Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11149-013-9222-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1380,Enforcing compliance with international environmental agreements using a deposit-refund system,"Whether nations are able to cooperatively manage shared resources through international environmental agreements (IEAs) depends on whether compliance with voluntary commitments can be enforced. Given that nations are sovereign enforcing compliance with IEAs cannot rely on the presence of a strong sanctioning body. Nonetheless, enforcement provisions must be effective in the sense that they will deter non-compliance and credible in the sense that they will actually be imposed. In this paper, we address the problem of enforcing compliance with IEAs by examining one promising mechanism—a deposit-refund system—that exhibits the necessary features for effective enforcement. We analyze a simple model to demonstrate the desirable properties of the mechanism and then consider the effects of imperfect monitoring, uncertainty, partial participation and reputation on the effectiveness of a deposit-refund system.",2013-11-01,10.1007/s10784-013-9209-2,"['McEvoy, David M.']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-013-9209-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1381,Market Effects of Voluntary Climate Action by Firms: Evidence from the Chicago Climate Exchange,"Are private voluntary environmental actions by firms a sign of mismanagement, or a profitable “win-win” replacement for regulation? Empirical evidence is decidedly mixed. In this study, we use 19 years of monthly stock price returns, from 1991 to 2009, to examine the profitability of participation in CCX, a large voluntary greenhouse gas mitigation program. After controlling for systemic market risk as well as industry-specific shocks, we find statistically significant and positive excess returns for firms that announce their decision to join CCX. In addition, the progress of proposed greenhouse gas legislation (the Waxman–Markey bill) had a positive and large impact on excess returns for CCX member firms, suggesting that a major incentive for firms to join CCX may be to prepare for future regulation. Marginal abatement costs (proxied by the carbon price), on the other hand, were unrelated to excess returns. Our results imply that voluntary approaches should play a role in combating climate change, but that relying on them alone is not enough.",2013-06-01,10.1007/s10640-012-9626-7,"['Gans, Will', 'Hintermann, Beat']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-012-9626-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

The analysis begins with the identification of the distribution, uses and potential uses of the energy resources in the N. African countries. Then growth opportunities for N. African economies are examined in the context of an increasing intensity of climate policy and of a widening of its geographical scope providing opportunities for cross border integration of energy markets, for extension of emission permit markets and the use of JI and CDM development mechanisms (JI (Joint Implementation) and CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) are market instruments introduced in the Kyoto Protocol). In particular, alternative scenario simulations are used to analyze how the N. African countries may gain from incorporation into Europe’s greenhouse gas abatement effort. From a methodological point of view the analysis is performed by means of a computable general equilibrium model, named GEM-E3-Med, specifically constructed for the CIRCE project (CIRCE Integrated Project – Climate Change and Impact Research: the Mediterranean Environment.

1384,Summary and Major Findings,"People is the common theme in this part of the RACCM. The part gathers results from the CIRCE project that concern socio-ecological systems all around the Mediterranean. Due to the interdisciplinarity of the project, chapters in this part discuss climate change and societies from different perspectives, such as an economic, social science, or the health sector’s point of view. The chapters treat such diverse topics as socio-economic assessment, adaptive capacity and adaptation strategies, health, energy demand and mitigation options, water, tourism, retirement migration, and future options for the Mediterranean. Thus, this part offers a broad overview over aspects of human life in the Mediterranean region influenced by, and influencing, climate change. In the present section we first give a brief outline of the different chapters dealing with People , then indicate main findings about specific topics, and finally highlight some themes recurring through the different chapters.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5772-1_18,"['Wolf, Sarah', 'Jaeger, Carlo']",Regional Assessment of Climate Change in the Mediterranean,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5772-1_18,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1385,Climate Change Strategies of Selected Greek Businesses: An Empirical Investigation,"This paper explores the strategies adopted by a sample of Greek businesses in relation to climate change mitigation and adaptation issues. In particular, the voluntary initiatives of a sample of Greek businesses with respect to climate change issues are examined, such as voluntary involvement in national and international associations on climate change, emission trading, the installation of low-carbon intensive equipment and carbon reduction management. An analysis of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reports is presented. Specifically, the methodology used in this study is based mainly on a synthesis of methodologies previously used in other academic articles focusing on business climate change. The sample of businesses was selected using the following criteria: the existence of published CSR reports; the impact on the environment of the industry in which the selected businesses operate; and the environmental protection practices undertaken on climate change issues. It was discovered that the selected Greek businesses adopt either political or strategic actions to face climate change problems. The findings show that over half of the businesses adopt political actions, while the total sample implemented various types of strategies to respond to climate change problems. This paper represents primary research into the climate change strategies of a selected number of Greek businesses, and could be useful for a range of other national and international businesses and academics.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-29831-8_18,"['Ioannis, Nikolaou E.', 'Konstantinos, Evangelinos I.', 'Leal Filho, Walter']",Climate Change Governance,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-29831-8_18,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1386,Mitigating methane emissions from livestock: a global analysis of sectoral policies,"Methane emissions from livestock enteric fermentation and manure management represent about 40% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector and are projected to increase substantially in the coming decades, with most of the growth occurring in non-Annex 1 countries. To mitigate livestock methane, incentive policies based on producer-level emissions are generally not feasible because of high administrative costs and producer transaction costs. In contrast, incentive policies based on sectoral emissions are likely administratively feasible, even in developing countries. This study uses an economic model of global agriculture to estimate the effects of two sectoral mitigation policies: a carbon tax and an emissions trading scheme based on average national methane emissions per unit of commodity. The analysis shows how the composition and location of livestock production and emissions change in response to the policies. Results illustrate the importance of global mitigation efforts: when policies are limited to Annex 1 countries, increased methane emissions in non-Annex 1 countries offset approximately two-thirds of Annex 1 emissions reductions. While non-Annex 1 countries face substantial disincentives to enacting domestic carbon taxes, developing countries could benefit from participating in a global sectoral emissions trading scheme. We illustrate one scheme in which non-Annex 1 countries collectively earn USD 2.4 billion annually from methane emission permit sales when methane is priced at USD 30/t CO_2-eq.",2012-05-01,10.1007/s10584-011-0206-6,"['Key, Nigel', 'Tallard, Gregoire']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-011-0206-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1387,"Climate Policy, Learning, and Technology Adoption in Small Countries","A significant reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions requires international cooperation in emission abatement as well as individual countries’ investment in the adoption of abatement technology. The existing literature on climate policy pays insufficient attention to small countries, which account for a substantial proportion of global emission. In this study, we investigate how climate policy and learning about climate damage affect investment in abatement technology in small countries. We consider three alternative climate policy instruments: emission standards, harmonized taxes and auctioned permits. We say that learning is feasible if an international environmental agreement (IEA) is formed after the resolution of uncertainty about climate damage. We find that, either with learning and quadratic abatement costs or without learning, harmonized taxes outperform emission standards and auctioned permits in terms of investment efficiency. Without learning, a large cost of nonparticipation (that a country incurs) in the IEA can be beneficial to the country. Whether learning improves investment efficiency depends on the size of this nonparticipation cost.",2012-03-01,10.1007/s10640-011-9504-8,"['Hong, Fuhai', 'Wang, Susheng']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-011-9504-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

1389,Variational Inequality Formulations for Oligopolistic Electricity Models with Marketable CO_2 Emission Permits,"In this paper, we first provide an introduction of the electricity market and its major players. Then, equilibrium models of the CO_2 emission permits market are discussed. We consider a variational inequality (VI) approach to model an oligopolistic competition in the market of CO_2 emission permits and electric power. A Cournot model of electricity market is described and a variational inequality framework is developed for oligopolistic electricity models with marketable CO_2 permits. Properties of the model are provided and some solution methods are discussed. A simple example is presented and implemented in a PC and solved by a built-in solver powered by Newton’s method of VI. Discussions of possible extensions of the model are given, like using conjectured supply function approach and including non-electric power participants of CO_2 trading.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-27431-2_1,"['Chung, William']",Handbook of CO₂ in Power Systems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-27431-2_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1390,Environmental Issues,"Climate change is no longer a theory and has fast become an unequivocal reality and a defining issue of our time. Its enormity can be identified numerically. For instance 2005 was the warmest year on record. There has been a 33% rise in global carbon dioxide emissions since 1987. The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) records that 5 million extra people are at risk of hunger by the year 2020 if climate change continues unabated. The 2003 heat wave killed 35,000 people in Europe. Environmental campaigner Sheila Watt-Cloutier, in her article “A Human Issue” in the May 2007 issue of “ Our Planet ” – the magazine of the United Nations Environment Programme, says that there are palpable signs of drastic climate change in the Arctic, which she calls the health barometer for the planet. Whatever happens in the world occurs first in the Arctic – the home of Inuit. In 2004 certain conclusions were reached by the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) as a result of work carried out by 300 scientists from 15 countries. Among the results, according to Watt-Cloutier, is that for Inuit, warming is likely to disrupt or even destroy their hunting and food-sharing culture as reduced sea ice causes populations to decline or become extinct. The Inuit have lived in the arctic for thousands of years and their culture and economy reflect their homeland. Climate change in the arctic would therefore infringe the basic human right of the Inuit to life.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-21960-3_4,"['Abeyratne, Ruwantissa']",Strategic Issues in Air Transport,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-21960-3_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1391,International Efforts to Combat Global Warming,"This chapter sheds some light on the international efforts to curb the global warming threat. The dominant climate agreement to date is the Kyoto Protocol, although competing – or allegedly complement – international climate protection schemes like the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate also exist. After describing the main features of these schemes and their failure to establish an efficient global climate protection regime, the disincentives for countries to commit to efficient climate protection efforts in an international agreement are elaborated on. The negotiation situation faced by national governments is depicted in game theoretic settings and private ancillary benefits of climate policy are identified to raise the likelihood for countries joining an international agreement. Yet, it remains quite disputable to which extent ancillary benefits can be an impetus for more action in international climate policy. Finally, after dedicating a large part of the chapter to agreements that, like the Kyoto Protocol, stipulate abatement quantities, alternative schemes are presented which were coined “price ducks” since they influence the effective prices of climate protection. By manipulating prices, e.g., via an international carbon tax, incentives are generated for producing higher climate protection levels. Recently, so-called matching schemes influencing effective prices of climate protection raised much attention in the scientific literature. Such schemes may attenuate free- or easy-rider incentives in international climate policy and may even induce a globally efficient climate protection level.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4419-7991-9_4,"['Pittel, Karen', 'Rübbelke, Dirk', 'Altemeyer-Bartscher, Martin']",Handbook of Climate Change Mitigation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-7991-9_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

The World Bank records that developing countries will have a compelling need over the coming decades to invest upwards of US $ 139 to $ 175 billion annually up to 2030 if they are to limit the rise of global mean temperature to +2°C above pre industrial levels. These countries are already taking measures, using their own resources to mitigate the effects of industrial emissions. They are also hopeful of the commitment of the developed countries to provide them with an additional US $ 30 billion by 2012 and a continuing annual contribution of US $ 100 billion up to 2020 which was made at the Conference of the Parties (COP16) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2010.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-28945-3_4,"['Abeyratne, Ruwantissa']",Aeronomics and Law,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-28945-3_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1393,Emission Trading and Market Access of Renewables,"In this chapter we look at the impact of different carbon emission prices combined with the Real-Time Pricing (RTP) to the promotion of renewable energy (wind) to enter the Nordic power market. We show that regardless of the carbon price the amount of wind entering to the market increases with the share of the consumers on RTP. The amount of wind entering to the market is also really increasing with the emission permit price. The increase in the amount of wind power is shown also as reduced emissions of carbon dioxide. The reduction is bigger the higher is the emission price. The decrease in emissions is strengthening as the share of the customers in RTP increases. Notably, even though wind power is entering to the market as the carbon price increases we do not reach the aggregate national target level for wind power even with very high carbon price at least if we assume risk averse wind power investors. Consequently if we want to see high levels of installed wind power capacity also other support mechanisms are needed.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4471-2972-1_6,"['Kopsakangas-Savolainen, Maria', 'Svento, Rauli']",Modern Energy Markets,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-2972-1_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1394,"Restructuring of Electricity Markets
		",In this chapter we present and discuss the grounds and incentives of the deregulation and liberalization processes that have been carried out in many countries during the past few decades. We also assess the crucial factors which affect the potential successfulness of the deregulation and liberalization processes. We use the first international electricity market (Nordic power market) as an example to characterize and describe the restructuring process of the electricity industry. According to our assessment the success of deregulation and improved efficiency as a result of the restructuring process depends largely on six issues; on the number of active players; on the rules of bidding procedure in the wholesale market of electricity; on the organization and provided incentives of the demand-side management; on the neutral role of the transmission grid; on the mixture of production technologies; and finally on the ownership structure of the market participants.,2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4471-2972-1_2,"['Kopsakangas-Savolainen, Maria', 'Svento, Rauli']",Modern Energy Markets,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-2972-1_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1395,Preparing the design of robust climate policy architectures,"The design of climate policy architectures depends on how its multiple designers identify the climate problem, on the principles they adhere to, and on the criteria they apply for assessing the performance of the constructed agreements. This article presents five core features of the climate policy problem, five principles demanding respect when designing policy, and a particular specification of the four general criteria: efficacy, efficiency, equity, and institutional feasibility. The central policy problem of climate change is the phasing out of non-sustainable energy use by orchestrating trillions of decisions by billions of people. Principles like universality, realism, and transparency are important, but when balancing a global agreement, taking into account diversity and sovereignty are outstanding. For addressing the climate change challenges, the equity criterion should be taken more seriously by the negotiating countries than at present. In a diverse world, equity conflicts are likely to be further exacerbated by attempts to impose uniform approaches like global carbon trading or a harmonized global carbon tax rate. The uniform approaches, lauded by economists and policy makers as superior, are also criticized here as not being so effective and efficient as pretended.",2011-11-01,10.1007/s10784-010-9130-x,"['Verbruggen, Aviel']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-010-9130-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1396,Intertemporal Emissions Trading and Market Power: Modeling a Dominant Firm with a Competitive Fringe,"In international emissions trading schemes such as the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, the suboptimal negotiation of the cap with respect to total pollution minimization leads us to critically examine the proposition that a generous allocation of grandfathered permits by the regulator based on recent emissions might pave the way for dominant positions. Stemming from this politically given market imperfection, this chapter develops a differential Stackelberg game with two types of non-cooperative agents: a large potentially dominant agent, and a competitive fringe the size of which are exogenously determined. Strategic interactions are modeled on an intra-industry permits market where agents can freely bank and borrow permits. This chapter contributes to the debate on the allocation of initial permits and market power by focusing on the effects of allowing banking and borrowing. A documented appraisal on whether or not such provisions should be included is frequently overlooked by the debate on whether or not to introduce the permits market itself among other environmental regulation tools.

1397,The CO_2 Trading Market in Europe: A Financial Perspective,"The trading of carbon dioxide (CO_2) emission allowances, or permits, has been established in recent years as one of the primary mechanisms for tackling global warming and climate change. The European Union (EU) has taken an important initiative in this direction by establishing in 2003 the first ever mandatory cap-and-trade system for CO_2 permits: the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). The purpose of this paper is to initially provide a brief introduction to the EU ETS and subsequently assess its operation during the years 2005–2010 from a financial market perspective.

1398,Permit Trading and Credit Trading: A Comparison of Cap-Based and Rate-Based Emissions Trading Under Perfect and Imperfect Competition,"This paper compares emissions trading based on a cap on total emissions (permit trading) and on relative standards per unit of output (credit trading). Two types of market structure are considered: perfect competition and Cournot oligopoly. We find that output, abatement costs and the number of firms are higher under credit trading. Allowing trade between permit-trading and credit-trading sectors may increase welfare. With perfect competition, permit trading always leads to higher welfare than credit trading. With imperfect competition, credit trading may outperform permit trading. Environmental policy can lead to exit, but also to entry of firms. Entry and exit have a profound impact on the performance of the schemes, especially under imperfect competition. We find that it may be impossible to implement certain levels of total industry emissions. Under credit trading several levels of the relative standard can achieve the same total level of emissions.",2009-09-01,10.1007/s10640-009-9266-8,"['Boom, Jan-Tjeerd', 'Dijkstra, Bouwe R.']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-009-9266-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1399,Is environmental regulation bad for competition? A survey,"Theoretical and empirical research points to environmental regulation affecting the vigour of competition in product markets. We provide a critical, selective survey of that research. Environmental regulations can advantage large firms over small and raise concentration. They can discourage entry in their own right, and provide instruments with which incumbents can discourage entry strategically. They can provide the basis for predatory behavior by incumbents. Policy governance needs to be coordinated sufficiently to ensure that these secondary effects are accounted for in policy design.

1400,"Carbon offsets, reversal risk and US climate policy","Background One controversial issue in the larger cap-and-trade debate is the proper use and certification of carbon offsets related to changes in land management. Advocates of an expanded offset supply claim that inclusion of such activities would expand the scope of the program and lower overall compliance costs, while opponents claim that it would weaken the environmental integrity of the program by crediting activities that yield either nonexistent or merely temporary carbon sequestration benefits. Our study starts from the premise that offsets are neither perfect mitigation instruments nor useless ""hot air."" Results We show that offsets provide a useful cost containment function, even when there is some threat of reversal, by injecting additional ""when-flexibility"" into the system. This allows market participants to shift their reduction requirements to periods of lower cost, thereby facilitating attainment of the least-cost time path without jeopardizing the cumulative environmental integrity of the system. By accounting for market conditions in conjunction with reversal risk, we develop a simple offset valuation methodology, taking into account the two most important factors that typically lead offsets to be overvalued or undervalued. Conclusion The result of this paper is a quantitative ""model rule"" that could be included in future legislation or used as a basis for active management by a future ""carbon fed"" or other regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the US carbon market to actively manage allowance prices.",2009-06-15,10.1186/1750-0680-4-3,"['Mignone, Bryan K', 'Hurteau, Matthew D', 'Chen, Yihsu', 'Sohngen, Brent']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/1750-0680-4-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

Unlike in previous studies, unit pollution abatement cost is determined endogenously by incorporating technology adoption as a binary decision variable. The results show that when technologies are lumpy and irreversible, disequilibrium might occur due to firms’ inability to manage their emission levels after installing equipment with fixed size and control capacity.",2009-04-01,10.1007/s10666-007-9122-6,"['Liao, Chao-ning', 'Önal, Hayri']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10666-007-9122-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1402,Incentives for energy efficiency in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme,"This paper explores the incentives for energy efficiency induced by the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) for installations in the energy and industry sectors. Our analysis of the National Allocation Plans for 27 EU Member States for phase 2 of the EU ETS (2008–2012) suggests that the price and cost effects for improvements in carbon and energy efficiency in the energy and industry sectors will be stronger than in phase 1 (2005–2007), but only because the European Commission has substantially reduced the number of allowances to be allocated by the Member States. To the extent that companies from these sectors (notably power producers) pass through the extra costs for carbon, higher prices for allowances translate into stronger incentives for the demand-side energy efficiency. With the cuts in allocation to energy and industry sectors, these will be forced to greater reductions; thus, the non-ET sectors like household, tertiary, and transport will have to reduce less, which is more in line with the cost-efficient share of emission reductions. The findings also imply that domestic efficiency improvements in the energy and industry sectors may remain limited since companies can make substantial use of credits from the Kyoto Mechanisms. The analysis of the rules for existing installations, new projects, and closures suggests that incentives for energy efficiency are higher in phase 2 than in phase 1 because of the increased application of benchmarking to new and existing installations and because a lower share of allowances will be allocated for free. Nevertheless, there is still ample scope to further improve the EU ETS so that the full potential for energy efficiency can be realized.",2009-02-01,10.1007/s12053-008-9029-3,"['Schleich, Joachim', 'Rogge, Karoline', 'Betz, Regina']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12053-008-9029-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1403,Emissions Trading,"Emissions trading is a comparatively new policy instrument which has recently been introduced to the existing governance structure of electricity systems in Europe. The development of emissions trading thus represents an innovation in its own right, an innovation in governance. This chapter discusses emissions trading as an innovation in the context of the broader task of transforming electricity systems for sustainable development. We place a special focus on the various design options of emissions trading and their likely impact on the sustainable development of electricity systems. A short analysis of the innovation process that led to the currently observable policy practices demonstrates the intricacies of putting policy theory in practice. In conclusion, we draw together analysis of design options and innovation dynamics to discuss possibilities for shaping the innovation process of emissions trading with a view to exploiting the potentials of emissions trading for the sustainable development of electricity systems.",2009-01-01,10.1007/978-3-7908-2076-8_7,"['Praetorius, Barbara', 'Bauknecht, Dierk', 'Cames, Martin', 'Fischer, Corinna', 'Pehnt, Martin', 'Schumacher, Katja', 'Voß, Jan-Peter']",Innovation for Sustainable Electricity Systems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-7908-2076-8_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1404,Optimal compliance with emission constraints: dynamic characteristics and the choice of technique,"The paper analyzes how to comply with an emission constraint, which restricts the use of an established energy technique, given the two options to save energy and to invest in two alternative energy techniques. These techniques differ in their deterioration rates and the investment lags of the corresponding capital stocks. Thus, the paper takes a medium-term perspective on climate change mitigation, where the time horizon is too short for technological change to occur, but long enough for capital stocks to accumulate and deteriorate. It is shown that, in general, only one of the two alternative techniques prevails in the stationary state, although, both techniques might be utilized during the transition phase. Hence, while in a static economy only one technique is efficient, this is not necessarily true in a dynamic economy.",2008-04-01,10.1007/s10640-007-9133-4,"['Winkler, Ralph']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-007-9133-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1405,Participants’ treatment of allowance price uncertainty: how are risk-aversion and real option values related to each other?,"The way in which participants of a tradable allowance system treat the allowance price uncertainty has so far been analysed either as reductions in “market exposure” resulting from risk-aversion, or as “wait-and-see” strategies in the sense of real option theory. This paper analyses how these two reactions could interact. The following conclusions can be drawn from this integration under the assumptions that participants are at least on aggregate risk-averse, that relative market positions (seller or buyer) are a result of differences in abatement cost and not of systematic differences in risk-attitude, that investments are to a significant degree irreversible, and that no dominant “flipping” of buyers becoming sellers occurs: Under free allocation according to historic emissions, a higher price risk is likely to lead to an aggregate reduction of abatement investment at any point in time. Innovative investment (i.e, investment employing new technologies) is also reduced, plausibly to an even stronger extent than investment in general. Auctioning generally leads to higher abatement investment than free allocation under risky allowance prices, since under auctioning all agents are “buyers” in the market. The overall effect of price risk on abatement investment is ambiguous under auctioning and depends on the relative importance of the revenues lost while “waiting-in-line”, compared to the option value of waiting, which depends on the relative importance of the “random” price factors.",2008-01-01,10.1007/978-0-387-77353-7_10,"['Gagelmann, Frank']",Economics and Management of Climate Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-0-387-77353-7_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1406,"The influence of the allocation method on market liquidity, volatility and firms’ investment decisions","When taking incomplete information and risk into account, it is likely that the primary allocation method has an impact on static efficiency and also on firms‘ investment and innovation decisions. Market liquidity and allowance price volatility are crucial factors in this respect. Benchmarking is, from a simple analytical finding, more conducive to a liquid market in the first years of an ET system than grandfathering. This in turn influences firms’ expectations about the future market development, including volatility. A liquid market is more conducive to all abatement approaches that are connected to investment, including to innovation. The degree of this effect depends, among other things, on the availability of non-investment abatement approaches, the nature of the price shocks and the precise risk treatment by firms.",2008-01-01,10.1007/978-0-387-73653-2_5,"['Gagelmann, Frank']",Emissions Trading,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-0-387-73653-2_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

Beyond the environmental effects of such coalitions, these schemes can provide industrialists a legitimate way to disadvantage rivals, frequently foreign rivals, by raising their costs. We consider a Stackelberg model that determines the conditions under which a domestic firm has incentive to impose an eco-label in order to raise the costs of its foreign rivals. The effects of eco-labeling on domestic social welfare are ambiguous. Policy recommendations are drawn.

1408,The price of non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol: The remarkable case of Norway,"One of the ways to induce compliance is for an international enforcement mechanism to authorize the use of punitive consequences against a non-compliant country. However, such consequences should not cause significant damage to other (compliant) countries. The compliance mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol fails to meet this requirement. The Enforcement Branch of the Compliance Committee is instructed to impose punitive consequences on a non-compliant country that will have considerable adverse welfare effects for compliant countries as well. Using a numerical model, we show that in the case of Norway, the welfare effects can actually be worse if another country is punished than if Norway itself is punished.",2007-03-01,10.1007/s10784-006-9025-z,"['Kallbekken, Steffen', 'Hovi, Jon']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-006-9025-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1409,Market Power with Interdependent Demand: Sale of Emission Permits and Natural Gas from Russia,"With implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, Russia will most likely be able to exert market power in the emission permit market. But, as Russia is also a big exporter of fossil fuels, the incentives to boost the permit price may be weak. However, a significant share of Russia’s fossil fuel exports is natural gas. If a high permit price boosts the demand for natural gas through substitution from more polluting fuels and thus increase gas profits, this may increase the incentives to exert monopoly power in the permit market. Moreover, a large fossil fuel exporter may use its market position to influence the effective demand for permits. Hence, the relationship between permit income and fossil fuels exports runs in both directions. In this article, we explore the interdependence between the revenues from permit and fossil fuel exports both theoretically and numerically. A computable general equilibrium model suggests the fact that Russia as a big gas exporter has small effect on the incentives to exert monopoly power in the permit market. Moreover, Russia’s monopoly power in the permit market has a small, but non-negligible impact on the optimal level of Russian gas exports.",2006-06-01,10.1007/s10640-005-6206-0,"['Hagem, Cathrine', 'Kallbekken, Steffen', 'Mæstad, Ottar', 'Westskog, Hege']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-005-6206-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1410,International Emissions Trading and Induced Carbon-Saving Technological Change: Effects of Restricting the Trade in Carbon Rights,"This paper examines the implications of restricting the tradability of carbon rights in the presence of induced technological change. Unlike earlier approaches aimed at exploring the tradability-technology linkage, we focus on climate-relevant “carbon-saving” technological change. This is achieved by incorporating endogenous investment in carbon productivity into the RICE-99 integrated assessment model of Nordhaus and Boyer (2000). Simulation analysis of various emission reduction scenarios with several restrictions on emissions trading reveals a pronounced dichotomy of effects across regions: Restrictions to trading raise the investments in carbon productivity in permit demanding regions while reducing them in permit supplying regions. In terms of per capita consumption, permit demanding regions lose and permit supplying regions gain from restrictions. In scenarios that involve “hot air,” restrictions to trade lower overall emissions, which results in reduced climate damage for most regions. Reduced damage, in turn, reduces the incentive to invest in carbon productivity.",2006-02-01,10.1007/s10640-005-3105-3,"['Matschoss, Patrick', 'Welsch, Heinz']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-005-3105-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer
1411,Enforcing Emissions Trading when Emissions Permits are Bankable,"We propose enforcement strategies for emissions trading programs with bankable emissions permits that guarantee complete compliance with minimal enforcement costs. Our strategies emphasize imperfect monitoring supported by a high unit penalty for reporting violations, and tying this penalty directly to equilibrium permit prices. This approach is quite different from several existing enforcement strategies that emphasize high unit penalties for emissions in excess of permit holdings. Our analysis suggests that a high penalty for excess emissions cannot be used to conserve monitoring effort, and that it may actually increase the amount of monitoring necessary to maintain compliance.",2005-09-01,10.1007/s11149-005-3108-6,"['Stranlund, John K.', 'Costello, Christopher', 'Chávez, Carlos A.']",Journal of Regulatory Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11149-005-3108-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

With positive transaction costs, in theory the initial distribution of permits can affect both abatement costs and equity. Consistent with theory, we find that with declining marginal transaction costs prices deviate less from the efficient level if the “misallocation” of the initial permit distribution is greater, and the deviation from efficient prices does not vary with the initial permit endowment when marginal transaction costs are constant.",2003-03-01,10.1023/A:1022254913539,"['Cason, Timothy N.', 'Gangadharan, Lata']",Journal of Regulatory Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1022254913539,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit market"")",springer

1417,Electrocatalytic Production of Methanol from Carbon Dioxide,"The increasing CO_2 atmospheric levels, associated with adverse climate change, and the decreasing fossil fuel reserves resulting from extensive power generation are of major environmental and sustainability concerns. The electrocatalytic production of methanol from CO_2 is a promising technology for CO_2 emission reduction and renewable energy storage as sustainable platform chemicals and combustibles. However, commercial application of the technology requires stable electrocatalysts that exhibit current densities above 0.1 A cm^−2, overpotentials below 200 mV, and Faradaic efficiencies close to 100%. This chapter highlights different recent approaches to fulfil these challenges and reviews the effect of applied catalytic and electrolyte material, electrode and electrochemical cell structure, and utilized operational parameters on process performance. Mo, Ru, and Cu are the most active catalysts. Strategies to improve electrocatalysts performance included alloying with other metals; oxidation and mixing with other metal oxides; being part of metal nanostructures, complexes, or organic frameworks; and depositing onto metal or porous carbonaceous supports. Finally, best catalysts were incorporated into practical structures, such as gas diffusion electrodes or thin films deposited on solid oxide electrolytes that operate on gaseous CO_2 and in a continuous mode in polymer electrolyte membrane or solid oxide electrolyte cells, respectively.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-28622-4_7,"['Ruiz Martínez, Esperanza', 'Sánchez Hervás, José María']",Conversion of Carbon Dioxide into Hydrocarbons Vol. 1 Catalysis,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-28622-4_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions permit carbon"")",springer

1419,Influence path and effect of climate change on geopolitical pattern,"Marked by the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen 2009, climate change is shaping the new pattern for future geopolitics with unprecedented drive. Climate change has surpassed the category of pure environment problem and become a focal issue in international relations. Driven by climate change, new changes have taken place in the evolution of geopolitical pattern. (1) Geopolitical contention expands into new fields and regions. (2) Measures and tools of geopolitical contention become more diversified. (3) Main bodies of geopolitical gambling are divided into different groups. With the development of politicization, climate change has become the significant driving force that can influence the evolution of geopolitical pattern. Measures, sphere and contents of geopolitical contention changed dramatically, carbon emission permits, carbon tariff and new energy technology turned into the key points of geopolitical contention. Climate change acts on the evolution of geopolitical pattern through three main paths: “Feedback effect”, “Trace back effect”, and “Ripple effect”, and they exert influence on geopolitical pattern with three impacts: “Depression effect”, “Traceability effect”, and “Diffusion effect”. We draw several conclusions from the analysis: (1) Climate change gradually becomes one of the most active driving forces to impact on the evolution of geopolitical pattern in the present world and it diversifies the geopolitical targets. (2) Climate change generates new geopolitical tools. The developed countries use climate change as a “Lever” to pry strategic resources like energy and grain and the geopolitical means are in a more secretive way.

1420,Carbon Offset Markets: A Viable Instrument?,"In this article, we explore the realm of carbon offset markets that have been set up to enable consumers to offset their share of carbon emissions. Though the market is a relatively new one, it has quickly spawned countless offset providers under both regulated and voluntary schemes. Our research points out that the market is widely unregulated and, furthermore, there is no common quality or certification structure for the offset providers. At this point in the evolution of the market, only a handful of offset provider ratings schemes exist; and even these schemes leave a vast void for consumers. The article begins with a discussion on the state of the carbon markets including the mandate from the Kyoto Protocol. Next, the article will examine the concept of carbon offsets and provide examples of the market. Our purpose is to present the logic and the working of carbon markets, especially in the space of market instruments aimed at lowering of carbon emissions. Moreover, we ask how this market developed and where is it headed. The article will outline the standards environment for offset providers in order to illustrate the need for a single set of criteria among providers. It will then explore the differences among the providers and articulate the specific criteria upon which providers may be evaluated. Finally, we share the results of the data collection and highlight early findings.

Through questionnaires and interviews, the study also identified the key stakeholders’ inclination and influence on land use decisions, i.e., preservation versus urbanization of the BZ. Then, the national and international policies of BZ management were reviewed to check the overall validity and credibility of the analytical results. The results revealed that the respondents in the responsible authorities have demonstrated a positive inclination to urbanization rather than preservation of BZ, whereas non-governmental organizations, practitioners, and academics have supported preservation rather than urbanization. In addition, the study also reported the conflict in interagency and multi-level coordination for urban development. In the national level, core zone development gains more support by containing ‘strategic open space’ and ‘no development zone.’ However, it contradicts the regional plan which allows the reduction of green coverage from 46.20 to 32.56%.

1424,Energy and environmental analysis of vinasse processing using internal circulation biodigesters and concentrators for different production ranges of ethanol and its potential impact on Brazil,"Vinasse is one of the worst waste products in the production of ethanol. However, it can be used to generate biogas, electricity, and carbon credits from biodigesters and concentrators. Thus, studying the use of vinasse is justified, and this study asks the following research question: How feasible is it to use internal circulation biodigesters with the vinasse concentrator Citrotec^®, and their conjugates in energy and environmental terms? To answer this question, the study employs quantitative methodology. To analyze this in terms of energy, the consumption of diesel in vinasse logistics has been calculated, the balance of energy in its processing and transport, its generation of electricity, and its capacity in terms of storage in urban centers. It has also been in terms of its incremental capacity in the production of cellulosic ethanol, the generation of electricity, and substitution for diesel, gasoline, and ethanol in the states of Brazil. The environmental analysis includes the balance and emission and mitigation of nitrous, sulfur, and carbon oxides in the processing and transport of vinasse, as well the figures for each Brazilian state that produces ethanol and the potential gains in the carbon credit market. The principal innovations of this article are a detailed analysis of the production ranges for autonomous sugar energy plants with a range of production from 500 to 4000 m^3/day, the processing and logistics of vinasse for planting, as well as an analysis of each Brazilian state for the 2015/2016 crop.

1425,Carbon revenue in the profitability of agroforestry relative to monocultures,"The impact of carbon revenue on the profitability of agroforestry systems in comparison to monocultures is unexplored in regard to Sub-Saharan Africa. This study creates a multivariate model to evaluate the impact of carbon revenue on the profitability of agroforestry relative to the dominant monocultures in Ethiopia by using stylized plots. Yields and carbon stock changes of eight agroforestry systems were modeled based on data from agroforestry plots in the Ethiopian Central Rift Valley. According to our model, agroforestry was, on average, four times more profitable than the main monoculture systems (wheat, barley, maize, teff, sorghum, sugarcane and lentil) even when carbon revenues were excluded, primarily due to the higher prices of fruit produce. Carbon revenues were estimated using a plausible carbon price ranging from US$8/tCO2e to $40/tCO2e and carbon sequestration rates of 0.59 to 17.2 Mg C ha^−1 year^−1. The possibility of receiving carbon revenue increased the profitability of agroforestry by 0.5% when using the lowest utilized carbon price and carbon sequestration rate, by 20% when using the carbon price of $20 and the average carbon sequestration rate, and by 70% when using the highest price and highest sequestration rate of carbon. On average, carbon revenue increased the profitability of agroforestry by 150% in comparison to monoculture farming. We conclude that carbon income may have significant potential to motivate smallholders to convert to agroforestry when there is a proper management system, a sufficiently high carbon price and effective institutional support to mitigate the transition and transaction costs.",2020-02-01,10.1007/s10457-019-00355-x,"['Waldén, Pirjetta', 'Ollikainen, Markku', 'Kahiluoto, Helena']",Agroforestry Systems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10457-019-00355-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

This aspect is more prominent in developing countries, in which there are many informal recycling activities and few environmental legislations regulating waste management. This chapter discusses the recycling challenges regarding the adoption of e-waste reverse logistics under the perspective of developing countries. For this purpose, we gathered information from papers published in international databases and reports such as the United Nations Environment Programme and Global e-waste Monitor, thus identifying data available to American countries (Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico), South Africa and Asian countries (China, India, Russia, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, South Korea, Thailand and Singapore). As key findings we can point out the categorization of the barriers into financial/economics, environmental, market related, legal, policy related, management, knowledge related and technical and technological related. As main contributions of this chapter, we can highlight (i) the compilation of information related to recycling challenges of e-waste in developing countries, and (ii) the identification of some solutions and actions to overcome these barriers is also performed, which can be useful for practitioners and researchers in this field.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-14184-4_5,"['Guarnieri, Patricia', 'Camara e Silva, Lúcio', 'Xavier, Lúcia Helena', 'Chaves, Gisele Lorena Diniz']",E-waste Recycling and Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-14184-4_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

During the last 20 years, a small but growing portion of companies is volunteering to attach social and environmental issues to its business models. One of the major recent issues on production management is about the generated waste, post-consumption matters, and aspects of the reverse logistics, in other words a framework of solid waste management that covers the products’ end-of-life. On developing countries, these models are only on its initial phase. There is no regulatory concern on the topic and no economic incentives, and the people who collect this kind of material do not have any instruction on how to do it, regarding its risks to health, safety, and the environment. Setting off on the recognition of the system’s limits and the major actors involved on its process of solid waste management is a necessity, elaborating the positive and negative social aspects linked to this activity, starting from the product life cycle way of thinking.

The entire Westphalian system is underwritten by finance. Yet, can the blind lead the blind? Despite being more than $22 trillion in debt (and technically impossible to ever repay this, even with roaring economic growth year-on-end) the US dollar, US financial system access, and US debt obligations all underpin the world’s finances. Those who have the gold make the rules is an appropriate saying. All ascriptions to US dollar-denominated debt instruments, such as bonds and stocks, are subject to US rules and laws, which have a global reach. As most countries’ sovereign debt holdings are in US dollars, the US then becomes not only the world’s de facto economic ruler, but also its enforcer. It is only logical then that any global solution for public goods problems (i.e., climate change, plastic waste, etc.), cross border finance, or economic policies priced or funded in dollars would be subject to US rules.

1430,From Economics as Fiction to Fiction-Led Capitalism,"Economists used to present themselves as rigorous social scientists and they were recognized as such by the hard sciences. In the early 2000s, macroeconomic theory was perceived as quasi-complete, concerning, for instance, the monitoring of business cycles. America’s subprime credit crisis, which went global, called this into question: mainstream economists had been unable to predict the coming crisis. This chapter provides a historical analysis of the epistemology and methodology of economics and argues that the reductionism typical of economists has failed: the profession had been proposing a coherent, but fictional, analysis of contemporary capitalisms. Similarly, mathematical finance went wrong in postulating that modern statistical techniques could extract accurate forecasts from the past, whereas market-led capitalism is, in fact, moved by storytelling, in an attempt to reduce uncertainty and complexity.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-36564-6_2,"['Boyer, Robert']",The Fictions of American Capitalism,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-36564-6_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

Dairy is the single major sector which contributes the maximum to global agricultural gross domestic product (GDP). High perishable nature of dairy products creates different challenges in the marketing value chain. The world dairy sector is highly competitive and also highly distorted due to high government interventions in the sector. The cost of cultivation of milk and processing cost of dairy products are the deciding factor of the competitiveness in the global market.

1433,Estimation of carbon storage of forest biomass for voluntary carbon markets: preliminary results,"Estimating the carbon storage of forests is essential to support climate change mitigation and promote the transition into a low-carbon emission economy. To achieve this goal, voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) are essential. VCMs are promoted by a spontaneous demand, not imposed by binding targets, as the regulated ones. In Italy, only in Veneto and Piedmont Regions (Northern Italy), VCMs through forestry activities were carried out. Valle Camonica District (Northern Italy, Lombardy Region) is ready for a local VCM, but carbon storage of its forests was never estimated. The aim of this work was to estimate the total carbon storage (TCS; t C ha^−1) of forest biomass of Valle Camonica District, at the stand level, taking into account: (1) aboveground biomass, (2) belowground biomass, (3) deadwood, and (4) litter. We developed a user-friendly model, based on site-specific primary (measured) data, and we applied it to a dataset of 2019 stands extracted from 45 Forest Management Plans. Preliminary results showed that, in 2016, the TCS achieved 76.02 t C ha^−1. The aboveground biomass was the most relevant carbon pool (48.86 t C ha^−1; 64.27% of TCS). From 2017 to 2029, through multifunctional forest management, the TCS could increase of 2.48 t C ha^−1 (+ 3.26%). In the same period, assuming to convert coppices stands to high forests, an additional TCS of 0.78 t C ha^−1 (equal to 2.85 t CO_2 ha^−1) in the aboveground biomass could be achieved without increasing forest areas. The additional carbon could be certified and exchanged on a VCM, contributing to climate change mitigation at a local level.",2019-12-17,10.1007/s11676-019-01074-w,"['Nonini, Luca', 'Fiala, Marco']",Journal of Forestry Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11676-019-01074-w,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer
1434,The Clean Development Mechanism and large dam development: contradictions associated with climate financing in Cambodia,"Since 2000, the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has been facilitating climate change financing in support of large hydropower dam development. Although the CDM was designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable development, it has financed hydropower dams that have caused serious environmental and social impacts. We consider the case of the Lower Sesan 2 dam in northeastern Cambodia, the largest and most environmentally and socially damaging hydropower dam ever built in Cambodia. LS2 has not received climate change financing through the CDM, as four other large dams in Cambodia have, because the market price for carbon credits is too low to justify the expense required to apply for them. However, it could be registered to receive climate financing post-construction. We highlight the apparent lack of improvements in critical areas of the CDM despite years of criticisms and suggest that there are framing and structural issues that will make reforming the CDM difficult. This topic is particularly timely because the CDM is scheduled to end in 2020, after which time it will be replaced by a new but yet unspecified climate change financing mechanism.",2019-12-03,10.1007/s10584-019-02621-4,"['Baird, Ian G.', 'Green, W.

1435,"Economic Analysis of Internal Circulation Biodigesters and Vinasse Concentrators for the Generation of Electricity, Fertilizers, and Carbon Credits in Various Brazilian Economic Scenarios","Vinasse is one of the byproducts of ethanol production, where it is considered to have a high polluting capacity. However, this same byproduct can be used to produce electricity, fertilizers, and biogas from anaerobic biodigesters and vinasse concentrators. Based on the foregoing, a study on the use of vinasse is justified, guided by the following question: what is the economic feasibility of the use of the internal circulation (IC) biodigester, vinasse concentrator, and the conjugate of both in three Brazilian economic scenarios (I, fertilizers, electricity and carbon credits with minimum attractiveness rate (MAR) of 10.5% per year (p.a); II, electricity and carbon credits with MAR of 10.5% p.a; and III, electricity and carbon credits with MAR of 5% p.a and tax exemption)? The general objective is to analyze the economic feasibility of the separate use of vinasse concentrators, IC biodigesters, and the use of both together. The methodology used for the economic feasibility analysis was to calculate the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), payback and discounted payback, which were calculated for a production range of ethanol ranging from 500 to 4000 m^3/day. As a result, it can be seen that fertilizer prices are important in terms of economic feasibility. Scenarios without tax exemptions and a high MAR are feasible only with sale of fertilizer. Electricity alone will only be feasible in a scenario with a low MAR and tax exemptions. The following measures are thus necessary to enable the use of vinasse to generate electricity: a reduction in interest rates, tax exemption policies for renewable energy, legal impediments to the disposal of vinasse in the soil, and the implementation of policies to encourage the use of biogas.

1436,"Aboveground biomass allometric equations and carbon content of the shea butter tree (Vitellaria paradoxa C.F. Gaertn., Sapotaceae) components in Sudanian savannas (West Africa)","Vitellaria paradoxa is one of the most economically important trees in West Africa. Although being a key component of most sub-Sahara agroforestry systems, little information and argument exist regarding its biomass and carbon potential. Here, we developed biomass equations for V. paradoxa tree components in Sudanian savannas. A destructive sampling approach was applied, which was based on measuring stem, branch and foliage biomass of thirty individual trees selected from a wide spectrum of diameter at breast height (dbh) and tree height (h). Basal diameter (d_20), dbh, h and crown diameter (c_d) were measured and used as predictors in biomass equations. Carbon content was estimated using the ash method. Variance explained in biomass allometric equations ranged from 81 to 98%, and was lower for foliage than for branch and stem biomass models, suggesting that leaf allometries are less responsive to tree size than branch and stem allometries. Stem biomass was best predicted by d_20, branch biomass by dbh, and leaf biomass by crown diameter. For aboveground biomass, adding height to dbh as compound variable (dbh^2 × h) did not make any significant change, as compared with model based on dbh alone. However, adding crown diameter to dbh and height reduced the error by 15% and improved model fits. Carbon contents in V. paradoxa foliage, branch and stem were 55.29, 55.37 and 55.82%, respectively, and higher than reference value suggested by the IPCC.

Currently, trillions of dollars of infrastructure investment are needed to meet our needs globally. Governments, constrained by debt and deficits, do not have the necessary means to meet this global infrastructure gap. Large institutional investors are increasingly filling this void.

It examines new financial instruments emerging in the sector such as Green Bonds and Community Benefit Public Private Partnerships. But integrating ESG in infrastructure investment is not without its challenges.

1444,"Decentralised, Off-Grid Solar Pump Irrigation Systems in Developing Countries—Are They Pro-poor, Pro-environment and Pro-women?","This systematic, evidence-based literature review examines the effectiveness of localised solar-powered small-scale irrigation systems (PVPs) in poverty reduction, environmental conservation and gender empowerment in developing countries. It suggests that PVPs are able to enhance farmers’ adaptive capacity by raising agricultural productivity and their incomes. They also help mitigate climate change by reducing CO_2 emissions. The distribution of the benefits and costs, brought by PVPs, is, however, so uncertain that requires further scrutiny. PVPs are successful in rising energy-water efficiency, but the environmental trade-offs with the underground water depletion and e-wastes requires solutions.

The collection step of the recycling process is, in essence, a transportation operation, with costs directly coupled with those of fuel. Thus, fuel consumption reduction can increase profit margins with a pleasant side effect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In this scenario, Green Vehicle Routing Problems (GVRP) are instrumental as enablers of more economic routes in the sense of fuel consumption.

1447,Biomass allometric equation and expansion factor for a mountain moist evergreen forest in Mozambique,"Background Worldwide, forests are an important carbon sink and thus are key to mitigate the effects of climate change. Mountain moist evergreen forests in Mozambique are threatened by agricultural expansion, uncontrolled logging, and firewood collection, thus compromising their role in carbon sequestration. There is lack of local tools for above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation of mountain moist evergreen forest, hence carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation are not adequately known. This study aimed to develop biomass allometric equations (BAE) and biomass expansion factor (BEF) for the estimation of total above-ground carbon stock in mountain moist evergreen forest. Methods The destructive method was used, whereby 39 trees were felled and measured for diameter at breast height ( DBH ), total height and the commercial height. We determined the wood basic density, the total dry weight and merchantable timber volume by Smalian’s formula. Six biomass allometric models were fitted using non-linear least square regression. The BEF was determined based on the relationship between bole stem dry weight and total dry weight of the tree. To estimate the mean AGB of the forest, a forest inventory was conducted using 27 temporary square plots. The applicability of Marzoli’s volume equation was compared with Smalian’s volume equation in order to check whether Marzoli’s volume from national forest inventory can be used to predict AGB using BEF. Results The best model was the power model with only DBH as predictor variable, which provided an estimated mean AGB of 291 ± 141 Mg ha^−1 (mean ± 95% confidence level). The mean wood basic density of sampled trees was 0.715 ± 0.182 g cm^−3. The average BEF was of 2.05 ± 0.15 and the estimated mean AGB of 387 ± 126 Mg ha^−1. The BAE from miombo woodland within the vicinity of the study area underestimates the AGB for all sampled trees. Chave et al.’s pantropical equation of moist forest did not fit to the Moribane Forest Reserve, while Brown’s equation of moist forest had a good fit to the Moribane Forest Reserve, having generated 1.2% of bias, very close to that generated by the selected model of this study. BEF showed to be reliable when combined with stand mean volume from Marzoli’s National Forestry Inventory equation. Conclusion The BAE and the BEF function developed in this study can be used to estimate the AGB of the mountain moist evergreen forests at Moribane Forest Reserve in Mozambique. However, the use of the biomass allometric model should be preferable when DBH information is available.",2018-11-26,10.1186/s13021-018-0111-7,"['Lisboa, Sá Nogueira', 'Guedes, Benard Soares', 'Ribeiro, Natasha', 'Sitoe, Almeida']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13021-018-0111-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer
1448,A synthesis of modern organic carbon accumulation rates in coastal and aquatic inland ecosystems,"Organic carbon accumulation in the sediments of inland aquatic and coastal ecosystems is an important process in the global carbon budget that is subject to intense human modification. To date, research has focused on quantifying accumulation rates in individual or groups of aquatic ecosystems to quantify the aquatic carbon sinks. However, there hasn’t been a synthesis of rates across aquatic ecosystem to address the variability in rates within and among ecosystems types. Doing so would identify gaps in our understanding of accumulation rates and potentially reveal carbon sinks vulnerable to change. We synthesized accumulation rates from the literature, compiling 464 rate measurements from 103 studies of carbon accumulated in the modern period (ca. 200 years). Accumulation rates from the literature spanned four orders of magnitude varying substantially within and among ecosystem categories, with mean estimates for ecosystem categories ranging from 15.6 to 73.2 g C m^−2 y^−1 within ecosystem categories. With the exception of lakes, mean accumulation rates were poorly constrained due to high variability and paucity of data. Despite the high uncertainty, the estimates of modern accumulation rate compiled here are an important step for constructing carbon budgets and predicting future change.",2018-10-24,10.1038/s41598-018-34126-y,"['Wilkinson, Grace M.', 'Besterman, Alice', 'Buelo, Cal', 'Gephart, Jessica', 'Pace, Michael L.']",Scientific Reports,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34126-y.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer
1449,Comparison of water-use characteristics of landscape tree (Tabebuia argentea) and palm (Ptychosperma macarthurii) species in a tropical roof garden with implications for urban water management,"In cities, landscape palms and trees are planted for scenic views and normally maintained with frequent irrigation. With similar water input, their morphological difference may lead to different water-use that varies seasonally. Thus, evaluating their water-use patterns is necessary to achieve proper urban water management. Here, we examined water-use characteristics of Tabebuia argentea and Ptychosperma macarthurii , a tree and a palm species, in a roof garden in Bangkok, Thailand. Self-constructed Granier’s probes were used for sap flux measurement and monitored for five months in 2016. Results showed that palm transpired 3–4 times higher water than tree daily. With frequent watering, tree was more sensitive to increasing vapor pressure deficit ( D ) than palm on rain-free days. When rainfall occurred, however, both species became less sensitive to D and continued consuming more water at high D . Extending the analysis to include a hypothetical warming climate with +4.8 °C temperature, we found that tree saved more water than palm on rain-free days. However, daily transpiration of both species increased similarly by 14–18% on rainy days. These results imply that Tabebuia argentea may provide ecosystem benefits by conservatively using water under drought and decelerating runoff from the garden when storms come. In contrast, Ptychosperma macarthurii may provide ecosystem disservice with high water-use in dry season but may slow down runoff in wet season and therefore benefiting downstream ecosystems. These findings are useful for selective planting associated with future changes in precipitation patterns, leading to sustainable urban water management.",2018-06-01,10.1007/s11252-018-0735-0,"['Tor-ngern, Pantana', 'Unawong, Weerapong', 'Tancharoenlarp, Thanrada', 'Aunroje, Pornwipa', 'Panha, Somsak']",Urban Ecosystems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11252-018-0735-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer
1450,"Floristic diversity, carbon storage and ecological services of eucalyptus agrosystems in Cameroon","Although agrosystems are recognized for their socio-economic value, few works have been conducted to assign its sequestration potential and ecological services. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the ecological services of the eucalyptus stands in order to permit to small producers the access in carbon credit market. Three stands were selected according to age. Data were compared to that of a savannah (control). In total, 12,817 individuals belonging to 30 families, 53 genera and 70 species were identified in the plantations against 7107 individuals belonging to 24 families, 36 genera and 42 species in the savannah. Gmelina, Annona, Hymenocardia, Allophyllus, Daniellia, Terminalia and Piliostigma were the most represented genera. There was no significant difference between Savannah and plantations in terms of diversity (p > 0.05). The largest stock of carbon was found in oldest stands (108.51 ± 26.46 t C/ha) against 13.62 ± 3.03 t C/ha in Savannah. Eucalyptus saligna stored 39.66 t C/ha (4 t C ha^−1year^−1) in young stands; 57.28 t C/ha (6 t C ha^−1year^−1) in medium stands and 85.46 t C/ha (9 t C ha^−1year^−1) in old stands. The sequestration potential was higher in eucalyptus stands (398.25 t CO_2eq/ha) than savannah (50.05 t CO_2eq/ha). In total 956.82 t CO_2eq/ha were sequestered for an economic value of $9568.45/ha against 50.05 t CO_2eq/ha corresponding to $500.56/ha in Savannah.

1451,Beyond opportunity costs: who bears the implementation costs of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation?,"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) in developing countries is based on the premise that conserving tropical forests is a cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions and therefore can be fully funded by international actors with obligations or interests in reducing emissions. However, concerns have repeatedly been raised about whether stakeholders in REDD+ host countries will actually end up bearing the costs of REDD+. Most prior analyses of the costs of REDD+ have focused on the opportunity costs of foregone alternative uses of forest land. We draw on a pan-tropical study of 22 subnational REDD+ initiatives in five countries to explore patterns in implementation costs, including which types of organizations are involved and which are sharing the costs of implementing REDD+. We find that many organizations involved in the implementation of REDD+, particularly at the subnational level and in the public sector, are bearing implementation costs not covered by the budgets of the REDD+ initiatives. To sustain this level of cost-sharing, REDD+ must be designed to deliver local as well as global forest benefits.",2018-02-01,10.1007/s11027-016-9736-6,"['Luttrell, Cecilia', 'Sills, Erin', 'Aryani, Riza', 'Ekaputri, Andini Desita', 'Evinke, Maria Febe']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-016-9736-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

1454,Current State and Future Prospects of Global Biogas Industry,"Biogas and biomethane deserve particular attention and support among renewable energy sources as these low-carbon technologies promote closed loop waste-energy systems. The industry can significantly contribute to further development of rural areas. The use of biogas in stationary engines for various agricultural operations (milling, grinding, powering water pumps and chaff cutters, etc.) also shows that it has the capacity to be a profitable business that can generate ample opportunities for employment in rural areas. Given the potential of biogas in off-grid, rural areas to meet household energy requirements and, to a small extent, rural industry requirements, the future prospects of biogas remain high. Global trends such as the increased rural to urban migration are limiting the potential of biogas in off-grid, rural areas. Increasingly, farmers are depending more on farm mechanization which is leading to a lower number of cows.

The author presents an historical overview, provides more details on the mechanisms, presents four case studies, and then undertakes both a financial analysis and a policy analysis, along with a future outlook. The 4 case studies are the Purus Project, the Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve REDD+ Project, the Kasigau Wildlife Corridor REDD Project—Phase I Rukinga Sanctuary, and the Rio Tinto QMM Biodiversity Offset Project. The Purus Project is the first private REDD+ project in Acre, Brazil—which is widely seen as the leading subnational jurisdiction working on REDD+-related initiatives—to achieve dual validation and verification to the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard (CCBS) with Gold Distinction. The Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve REDD+ Project is located on the island of Borneo within the Central Kalimantan province of Indonesia. The Project was the first REDD+ project in the world to be validated to the VCS and also the first REDD+ project in the world to achieve Triple Gold validation under the CCBS. Furthermore, this was the first REDD+ project to be approved in Indonesia and addresses all 17 of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Kasigau Wildlife Corridor REDD Project—Phase I Rukinga Sanctuary is the first VCS REDD+ project to complete verification and issuance. The Project is located in Kenya between Tsavo West and Tsavo East National Parks. The Project is in the process of reducing 7.5 million mtCO_2e over the first 30 years and helped spur additional projects. The Rio Tinto QMM Biodiversity Offset Project is located in Madagascar.

The reliable assessment and monitoring of soil carbon stocks is of key importance for soil conservation and in mitigation strategies for increased atmospheric carbon (Stockmann et al. 2013 ). Carbon credits are the heart of a cap-and-trade scheme, by offering a way to quantify carbon sequestered from the atmosphere; carbon credits gain a monetary value to offset a given amount of carbon dioxide releases (Paustian et al. 2009 ). The agricultural industry worldwide has the capacity to capture and store carbon emissions in soil (Paustian et al. 2000 ). However, there is still a debate on how soil can benefit for the offsets in the carbon economy because there is no good and efficient way of measuring soil carbon storage with appropriate statistical confidence (Post et al. 2001 ; Smith 2004b ).

1458,Do the Risk Attitudes of Smallholder Forest Managers Drive Their Forest Carbon Supply: A Risk Experiment in China,"It is widely recognized that enhancing forest carbon sequestration (FCS) can be an effective approach for mitigating climate change. Given the uncertainty about carbon pricing and the outcomes of FCS management, household perceptions of FCS management will be heavily dependent upon their risk attitudes, especially in developing countries with rich forest resources. Using a survey of 200 smallholder forest managers in Zhejiang Province in China and a risk experiment, this paper analyzes how the risk attitudes of households drive their FCS supply. We simulated the carbon supply with different risk attitudes of households based on a revised Faustmann model and a sensitivity analysis. A key finding is that compared with a timber benefit only, FCS management will generate more investment value. However, households have little incentive to change their harvest decision-making when the carbon price is low. Among the three identified risk attitude groups, although they have the same optimal rotation age when the carbon value is considered, their carbon supply per hectare is different due to difference in their planting densities. Also, the rotation age with FCS management and the FCS supply per hectare do not change significantly unless there is a substantial change in the carbon price, the management costs and the discount rate for all three risk attitude groups completely.",2017-09-01,10.1007/s11842-016-9357-7,"['Zhu, Zhen', 'Shen, Yueqin', 'Bai, Jiangdi']",Small-scale Forestry,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11842-016-9357-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer
1459,Review of Strategies for Thermal Efficiency in Landscape Planning of Cities for Conservation of Energy and Enhanced Climatic Resilience to Urban Warming,"Thermal discomfort, increased energy consumption, and heat related stress are some of the most prominent consequences of urban warming. Instances of heat related deaths have been reported; the elderly and the poor remain especially vulnerable. Urban greening has often been cited as an economically efficient method for inducing ambient cooling. Consequently, increased impetus is given to provision of public green spaces. However, a general increase in urban green cover especially in the form of parks and green spaces may be inadequate to achieve desired results. This article serves to highlight the thermal heterogeneity of landcape elements and stresses on the need for strategic shade provision. The originality of this study lies in the fact that it provides a comparative review of energy conservation potential of public and private green spaces. It is found that large parks may not have substantial cooling effect on the indoor built environment. Moreover, people tend to spend more time indoors than outdoors. Thus the need for greening of private areas has become an undeniable climatic necessity. The potential of shade trees, green walls, and roof gardens for cooling of built environment are discussed with quantitative evidences of their thermal and economic benefits. Parameters incurring cost expenditure and weaknesses of the greening strategies are enumerated for enabling prudent selection/implementation of strategies.

1460,Combined effect of pulse density and grid cell size on predicting and mapping aboveground carbon in fast-growing Eucalyptus forest plantation using airborne LiDAR data,"Background LiDAR remote sensing is a rapidly evolving technology for quantifying a variety of forest attributes, including aboveground carbon (AGC). Pulse density influences the acquisition cost of LiDAR, and grid cell size influences AGC prediction using plot-based methods; however, little work has evaluated the effects of LiDAR pulse density and cell size for predicting and mapping AGC in fast-growing Eucalyptus forest plantations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of LiDAR pulse density and grid cell size on AGC prediction accuracy at plot and stand-levels using airborne LiDAR and field data. We used the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm to model AGC using LiDAR-derived metrics from LiDAR collections of 5 and 10 pulses m^−2 (RF5 and RF10) and grid cell sizes of 5, 10, 15 and 20 m. Results The results show that LiDAR pulse density of 5 pulses m^−2 provides metrics with similar prediction accuracy for AGC as when using a dataset with 10 pulses m^−2 in these fast-growing plantations. Relative root mean square errors (RMSEs) for the RF5 and RF10 were 6.14 and 6.01%, respectively. Equivalence tests showed that the predicted AGC from the training and validation models were equivalent to the observed AGC measurements. The grid cell sizes for mapping ranging from 5 to 20 also did not significantly affect the prediction accuracy of AGC at stand level in this system. Conclusion LiDAR measurements can be used to predict and map AGC across variable-age Eucalyptus plantations with adequate levels of precision and accuracy using 5 pulses m^−2 and a grid cell size of 5 m. The promising results for AGC modeling in this study will allow for greater confidence in comparing AGC estimates with varying LiDAR sampling densities for Eucalyptus plantations and assist in decision making towards more cost effective and efficient forest inventory.",2017-06-07,10.1186/s13021-017-0081-1,"['Silva, Carlos Alberto', 'Hudak, Andrew Thomas', 'Klauberg, Carine', 'Vierling, Lee Alexandre', 'Gonzalez-Benecke, Carlos', 'Padua Chaves Carvalho, Samuel', 'Rodriguez, Luiz Carlos Estraviz', 'Cardil, Adrián']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13021-017-0081-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

Many scholars have suggested that the success of this emergent regime will depend, at least in part, on its ability to integrate climate action from non-state and subnational entities. Vertical alignment, the linking and coordination of policies between different levels of government, and horizontal alignment, the connection of peer cities and regions through networks of transnational climate governance, can help facilitate needed coherence. But, how do multiple actors link or interact at multiple scales and domains? In this article, we develop an analytical framework for examining different modes of vertical and horizontal alignment that subnational actors have employed to address climate change mitigation. We identify key elements in nine case studies of subnational climate action to examine the intersectionalities of alignment mechanisms that catalyze subnational climate actions.

1462,"Ecosystem services assessment of the urban forests of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Addis Ababa is a highland city with varied topography and landscape features.

Apart from surface temperature regulating function of the green spaces of Addis Ababa, no quantitative assessment of the carbon sequestration and soil protection ecosystem services provided by the urban forest has been conducted to date. The aim of this study was to assess selected ecosystem services such as carbon storage potential, habitat support and soil erosion protection provided by different categories of urban forest of Addis Ababa. The result showed that carbon density in the study area varied with forest categories viz. 293tons/ha, 142tons/ha and 132tons/ha in the dense, medium and open forest types respectively. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index is3.24 for Junipers dominated forest, 2.98 for mixed forest and 2.76 for Eucalyptus dominated forest. The formation of soil erosion features is significantly different among the Eucalyptus forest, Juniperus forest and Mixed forest where high incidence of soil erosion was recorded in the Eucalyptus forest. Therefore, irrespective of the environmental factors such as slope, aspect and elevation differences, there is an association between Eucalyptus forest cover and high soil erosion features. To ensure sustainable supply of ecosystem services and maintain a balanced urban environment, all green spaces in the city should be ecologically networked and diversified.

1463,Ramsey meets Thünen: the impact of land taxes on economic development and land conservation,"Land taxes can increase production in the manufacturing sector and enhance land conservation at the same time, which can lead to overall macroeconomic growth. Existing research emphasizes the non-distorting properties of land taxes (when fixed factors are taxed) as well as growth-enhancing impacts (when asset portfolios are shifted to reproducible capital). This paper furthers the neoclassical perspective on land taxes by endogenizing land allocation decisions in a multi-sector growth model. Based on von Thünen’s observation, agricultural land is created from wilderness through conversion and cultivation, both of which are associated with costs. In the steady state of our general equilibrium model, land taxes not only may reduce land consumption (associated with environmental benefits) but may also affect overall economic output, while leaving wages and interest rates unaffected. When labor productivity is higher in the manufacturing than in the agricultural sector and agricultural and manufactured goods are substitutes (or the economy is open to world trade), land taxes increase aggregate economic output. There is a complex interplay of conservation policy, technological change and land taxes, depending on consumer preferences, sectoral labor productivities and openness-to-trade. Our model introduces a new perspective on land taxes in current policy debates on development, tax reforms as well as forest conservation.",2017-04-01,10.1007/s10797-016-9403-6,"['Kalkuhl, Matthias', 'Edenhofer, Ottmar']",International Tax and Public Finance,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10797-016-9403-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer
1464,Individual tree biomass equations and growth models sensitive to climate variables for Larix spp. in China,"Climate change has increased the need of information on amount of forest biomass. The biomass and carbon storage for larch ( Larix spp.) in large geographic regions in China were failed to be accurately estimated from current biomass equations, because they were usually based on a few sample trees on local sites, generally incompatible to volume estimation, and not additive between components and total biomass. China needs reliable biomass estimation of the important species in the whole country. This study was based on the mensuration data of above- and belowground biomass from 600 and 198 destructive sample trees of larch from four regions in China, respectively. The main purpose was to develop compatible individual tree equations on both national and regional levels for above- and belowground biomass, biomass conversion factor and root-to-shoot ratio, using the nonlinear error-in-variable simultaneous equation approach. In addition, diameter at breast height ( D ) and tree height ( H ) growth models were also developed, and effects of key climate variables on biomass variation and growth process were analyzed. The results showed that mean prediction errors (MPEs) of regional aboveground biomass models were from 3.86 to 7.52%, and total relative errors (TREs) are within ±3%; and for regional belowground biomass equations, the MPEs are from 9.91 to 28.85%, and the TREs are within ±4%. The above- and belowground biomass and D - and H -growth were significantly related to mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation. The biomass equations and growth models developed in this paper will provide good basis for estimating and predicting biomass of larch forests in China.",2017-04-01,10.1007/s10342-017-1024-9,"['Zeng, WeiSheng', 'Duo, HaiRui', 'Lei, XiangDong', 'Chen, XinYun', 'Wang, XueJun', 'Pu, Ying', 'Zou, WenTao']",European Journal of Forest Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10342-017-1024-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

Record use of fossil fuels by all countries in aggregate for their economic activity has predicated a rise in earth’s CO_2 emissions. The science is there, though a political fringe of climate change deniers refuses to see the flawed model of over-reliance on fossil fuels. The only way to effectively deal with climate change is in having engaged and knowledgeable citizens take part in stewardship of these non-renewable forms of energy under their feet.

1467,Distillery Wastewater: A Major Source of Environmental Pollution and Its Biological Treatment for Environmental Safety,"Distillery industries are one of the major sources of environmental pollution because these industries discharge a huge volume of dark-colored wastewater into the environment. The wastewater discharged contains high biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total solids (TS), sulfate, phosphate, phenolics, and toxic heavy metals. On terrestrial region, distillery wastewater at higher concentration inhibits seed germination, growth and depletion of vegetation by reducing the soil alkalinity and Mn availability, whereas in aquatic region, it reduces sunlight penetration and decreases both photosynthetic activity and dissolved oxygen content damaging the aquatic ecosystem. The large volume of dark-colored wastewater acts as a major source of soil and water pollution and thus requires adequate treatment for its safe discharge into the environment. Therefore, the removal of pollutants and color from distillery wastewater is becoming increasingly important for the environment and sustainable development. Thus, this chapter provides the detailed information on the generation, characteristic, toxicity as well as various biological methods employing bacteria, fungi, microalgae, etc. for the treatment of distillery wastewater. In biological treatment approaches microalgae have a number of applications over the conventional approaches as it is useful in wastewater treatment, CO_2 sequestration, cost-effective, sanitation and also in the production of renewable energy sources such as methane gas, biodiesel, biofuel, glycerol, hydrogen gas, biofertilizers, etc. Furthermore, the merits and demerits of existing processes have been also summarized in this chapter.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-50654-8_18,"['Chowdhary, Pankaj', 'Yadav, Ashutosh', 'Kaithwas, Gaurav', 'Bharagava, Ram Naresh']",Green Technologies and Environmental Sustainability,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-50654-8_18,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

This shift must incorporate energy security, economic growth and carbon emission reductions in the strategic policy making and implementation. Many ASEAN Member states have started this paradigm, bringing clean and renewable energy access, industrial and household energy efficiency improvement, competitiveness, developing green technology markets, and supporting decent job creation. What has been the initial experience in the paradigm shift? What can policy makers learn from the experience and further advance the policy agenda at national level? How can actions further be accelerated through market based and non-market approaches of regional cooperation? This chapter addressees those questions using scenario analysis and analysis on policy effectiveness. Grounded in theories of decoupling and energy security, this chapter focus on both energy supply side (clean coal, renewable energy) and energy demand side (energy efficiency in industry and household sectors) energy management and needed regional cooperation initiatives (trade and investment, capacity building).

1475,Promotion of Sustainability by Quantifying and Reducing the Carbon Footprint: New Practices for Organizations,"This study has the objective of creating the relationship quantify-reduce-promote of the level of pollutants, emitted by companies, and society and governments. This relationship can be extended to assess what is emitted by society itself. Processes, products and even services that are environmentally friendly will be identified and this will help define critical aspects and those deserving special attention. Quantification of the environmental impacts is the first step to deepen knowledge on the activities of a company, directed to the reduction of these impacts. As a consequence of the improvement of operational and economic results there is a simultaneous improvement in the image of the company (how society perceives the company), created in function of the reduction of the pollution generated. Promotion of this information is already utilized by large companies, especially those involved with trading in financial markets. Until recently, organizations and companies had the vision that the environment and sustainable development were issues and risk factors. However the development of a generalized environmental conscience created a demand for products that are more environmentally-friendly (with less associated environmental impacts), for which there are great advances and developments in the application of eco-efficiency principles by industries and designers. Nowadays, these “issues” are seen as opportunities, as possibilities for growth and improvement of efficiency. Basically, eco-efficiency is doing more with less: better production, utilizing less resources. But eco-efficiency does not limit itself to simply achieving energy efficiency, it also stimulates creativity and innovation in the search for the best way to carry out activities. The search for eco-efficiency does not presuppose the complete elimination of the environmental impacts generated by modern society, rather it aims to bring these impacts to lower degrees, which are more compatible with current environmental conscience levels. In this way it is still possible to establish sustainable growth in Brazilian companies through the implementation of public politics and creation of awareness in entrepreneurs and society. Companies can generate non-operational revenue, achieving relevant volumes, from the negotiation of their processed/treated residues and also from the sale of carbon credits, generated from the elaboration of clean development mechanism (CDM) projects. In this way, the reduction in the levels of pollutant emissions has repercussions beyond the environmental benefits, allowing for economic benefits to be realized, enabling the sustainable growth of organizations. This study has the objective of creating the relationship quantify-reduce-promote of the level of pollutants, emitted by companies, and society and governments. This relationship can be extended to assess what is emitted by society itself. Processes, products and even services that are environmentally friendly will be identified and this will help define critical aspects and those deserving special attention. Quantification of the environmental impacts is the first step to deepen knowledge on the activities of a company, directed to the reduction of these impacts. As a consequence of the improvement of operational and economic results there is a simultaneous improvement in the image of the company (how society perceives the company), created in function of the reduction of the pollution generated. Promotion of this information is already utilized by large companies, especially those involved with trading in financial markets. Therefore, in a proactive and positive manner, good practice in environmental education will be stimulated at the same time an environmental conscience is built responsibly. The relationship quantify-reduce-promote has a strong social bias, as the minimization of environmental impacts benefits all Brazilian citizens and also empowers the consumer, who will be able to select the least aggressive option when consulting the environmental impacts associated with a product, process or service. This study is part of a wider project, which aims at utilizing environmental information generated by Life Cycle Assessment to help businesses and organizations quantify their environmental burden, carry out actions to reduce this burden, and promote this behavior as well as the results to improve social image while also realizing economic benefits due to improved energy/process efficiency and lower consumption of resources.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-30127-3_6,"['Carvalho, Monica', 'Santana Freire, Rommel', 'Brito, Alexandre Magno Vieira Gonçalves']","Energy, Transportation and Global Warming",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-30127-3_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

1477,A Critical Review of Carbon Credits for Household Water Treatment,"Household water treatment (HWT) provides a means for vulnerable populations to take charge of their own drinking water quality as they patiently wait for the pipe to finally reach them. In many low-income countries, however, promoters have not succeeded in scaling up the intervention among the target population or securing its consistent and sustained use. Carbon financing can provide the funding for reaching targeted populations with effective HWT solutions and the incentives to ensure their long-term uptake. Nevertheless, programs have been criticized because they do not actually reduce carbon emissions. We summarize the background and operation of carbon financing of HWT interventions, including the controversial construct of “suppressed demand”. We agree that these programs have limited potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that their characterization of trading “carbon for water” is misleading. Nevertheless, we show that the Kyoto Protocol expressly encouraged the use of suppressed demand as a means of allowing low-income countries to benefit from carbon financing provided it is used to advance development priorities such as health. We conclude by recommending changes to existing criteria for eligible HWT programs that will help ensure that they meet the conditions of microbiological effectiveness and actual use that will improve their potential for health gains.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-28643-3_9,"['Hodge, James M.', 'Clasen, Thomas F.']",Broken Pumps and Promises,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-28643-3_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

1486,Land Use Sector Involvement in Mitigation Policies Across Carbon Markets,"Different local and international experiences show that the agroforestry sector can be fully included in the global warming mitigation strategies and in the market mechanisms that may have environmental and socioeconomic benefits. At present, however, the primary sector plays only a minor role in mitigation policies within the UNFCCC and under Kyoto’s Protocol, due to problems and difficulties related to emission/absorption accounting models and monitoring and standardisation systems. If, on one hand, the progress in science has enabled to overcome accounting-related problems, on the other, there are no adequate mechanisms to encourage and remunerate the primary sector’s efforts. More specifically, if the primary sector is considered as a source of emissions, it should also be recognised that it has beneficial impacts, notably in economic terms, as carbon sink. Therefore, the definition of clear and internationally shared rules might increase the carbon friendly initiatives and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This article is focused on the international experiences that have concerned the primary sector and is intended to supply researchers and policymakers with suggestions and recommendations for implementing local market practices related to carbon credits.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-16357-4_16,"['Romano, Severino', 'Ferri, Simone Targetti', 'Ventura, Gennaro', 'Napoli, Francesco', 'Cozzi, Mario']",The Sustainability of Agro-Food and Natural Resource Systems in the Mediterranean Basin,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-16357-4_16,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

The areas of highest vulnerability are the health sector, food production, biodiversity, water resources, and rangelands. Climate change will likely create increasingly high temperatures and dry conditions across much of the globe in the next 30 years, especially along large parts of Eurasia, Africa and Australia. Many of the world’s most densely populated regions will be threatened with severe drought conditions. It will likely have a profound and negative impact on livelihoods of many rural and urban communities, which could lead to changes in land use. It is estimated that the Eastern regions of Africa will experience reduced average rainfall (although some areas may experience increased average rainfall) exposing agriculture to drought stress and a rise in temperature. The situation will be worsened by the interaction of multiple stresses factors occurring at various levels, which will negatively impact agricultural productivity.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-13000-2_2,"['Kimani, Stephen K.', 'Esilaba, Anthony O.', 'Njeru, Peterson N.

1488,Land grabbing: a preliminary quantification of economic impacts on rural livelihoods,"Global demands on agricultural land are increasing due to population growth, dietary changes and the use of biofuels. Their effect on food security is to reduce humans’ ability to cope with the uncertainties of global climate change. In light of the 2008 food crisis, to secure reliable future access to sufficient agricultural land, many nations and corporations have begun purchasing large tracts of land in the global South, a phenomenon deemed “land grabbing” by popular media. Because land investors frequently export crops without providing adequate employment, this represents an effective income loss for local communities. We study 28 countries targeted by large-scale land acquisitions [comprising 87 % of reported cases and 27 million hectares (ha)] and estimate the effects of such investments on local communities’ incomes. We find that this phenomenon can potentially affect the incomes of ~12 million people globally with implications for food security, poverty levels and urbanization. While it is important to note that our study incorporates a number of assumptions and limitations, it provides a much needed initial quantification of the economic impacts of large-scale land acquisitions on rural livelihoods.",2014-12-01,10.1007/s11111-014-0215-2,"['Davis, Kyle F.', 'D’Odorico, Paolo', 'Rulli, Maria Cristina']",Population and Environment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11111-014-0215-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

Different models viz., monomolicular, logistic, gompetz, allometric, rechards, chapman and linear were fitted to the relationship between total biomass and diameter at breast height (DBH) as independent variable. The adjusted R^2 values were more than 0.924 for all the seven models implying that all models are apparently equally efficient. Out of the six non-linear models, allometric model (Y =  a  × DBH^ b ) fulfils the validation criterion to the best possible extent and is thus considered as best performing. Biomass in different tree components was fitted to allometric models using DBH as explanatory variable, the adjusted R^2 for fitted functions varied from 0.872 to 0.965 for different biomass components. The t values for all the components were found non-significant (p > 0.05), thereby indicating that model is valid. Using the developed model, the estimated total biomass varied from 6.62 Mg ha^−1 in 4 year to 46.64 Mg ha^−1 in 23 year old plantation. MAI in biomass varied from 1.66–2.05 Mg ha^−1 yr^−1.

We apply the i-Tree Eco model to quantify in biophysical and monetary terms the ecosystem services “air purification,” “global climate regulation,” and the ecosystem disservice “air pollution” associated with biogenic emissions. Our results show that the contribution of urban forests regulating services to abate pollution is substantial in absolute terms, yet modest when compared to overall city levels of air pollution and GHG emissions.

1493,Landscape Evaluation and Restoration Planning,"Contemporary land managers are beginning to understand that landscapes of the early 20th century exhibited complex patterns of compositional and structural conditions at several different scales, and that there was interplay between patterns and processes within and across scales. Further, they understand that restoring integrity of these conditions has broad implications for the future sustainability of native species, ecosystem services, and ecological processes. Many too are hungry for methods to restore more natural landscape patterns of habitats and more naturally functioning disturbance regimes; all in the context of a warming climate. Attention is turning to evaluating whole landscapes at local and regional scales, deciphering their changes and trajectories, and formulating scale-appropriate landscape prescriptions that will methodically restore ecological functionality and improve landscape resilience. Here, we review published landscape evaluation and planning applications designed in EMDS. We show the utility of EMDS for designing transparent local landscape evaluations, and we reveal approaches that have been used thus far. We begin by briefly reviewing six projects from a global sample, and then review in greater depth four projects we have developed with our collaborators. We discuss the goals and design of each project, its methods and utilities, what worked well, what could be improved and related research opportunities. It is our hope that this review will provide helpful insights into how spatial decision support technologies may be used to evaluate and plan for local and perhaps larger-scale landscape restoration projects.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-32000-2_7,"['Hessburg, Paul F.', 'Brion Salter, R.', 'Reynolds, Keith M.', 'Dickinson, James D.', 'Gaines, William L.', 'Harrod, Richy J.']",Making Transparent Environmental Management Decisions,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-32000-2_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

The new low carbon technology for energy, water and waste are favoured by the precinct scale, especially the use of trigeneration, renewables, recycling wastewater, collecting rain water, waste to energy plants and automated solid waste collection. However, to make this work will require much more attention to the proper frameworks for carbon accounting and acknowledgement of best practice at precinct level. Governance will need to refocus on this smaller scale of delivery as it is not available at the moment.

1495,Cooling Potential of Urban Green Spaces in Summer,"The urban heat island phenomenon has recently become a serious subject of public concern. This chapter aims to clarify the cooling potential of urban green spaces in summer. At first, it shows that green space and anthropogenic heat emission have a great effect on the temperature in downtown areas from the various data collected from 27 observation points in Minato-ku, Tokyo. Then, it clarifies the cooling potential of green spaces. The results of multiple regression analysis, using the mean daily maximum temperatures in August as dependent variables and the size of woodland area and the amount of anthropogenic heat emissions as explanatory variables, showed that an increase in trees contributes to a reduction in temperature in urban areas, and that an increase in the amount of anthropogenic heat emissions causes a rise in temperature. A multiple regression model in equations and a coefficient of correlation among mean daily maximum temperature, woodland area, and amount of anthropogenic heat emissions were obtained as follows: Y = 32.0011 − 0.001( X _1) + 0.0033( X _2), r = 0.7276, where Y = the mean daily maximum temperature, X _1 = woodland area, and X _2 = the amount of anthropogenic heat emissions. From this regression analysis, it can be said that the cooling influence by green spaces of 22,500 m^2 is equivalent to the heating influence by the anthropogenic heat released from 70 offices of average size in Minato-ku, having a total floor area of about 211,726 m^2. Furthermore, the cooling potential of a green space of 22,500 m^2 during July to September can be expected to reduce about 236 times as much carbon dioxide as the same green space absorbs for 1 year. In conclusion, green spaces in urban downtown areas have the function of air conditioning provided by nature.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-4-431-54819-5_2,"['Tonosaki, Kochi', 'Kawai, Shiro', 'Tokoro, Koji']",Designing Low Carbon Societies in Landscapes,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-4-431-54819-5_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer
1496,Technical and Economic Modeling for the Production of Torrefied Lignocellulosic Biomass for the U.S. Densified Fuel Industry,"During recent years, a renovated interest in the pre-treatment of biomass through torrefaction has led to several proposals on industrial-scale application of the technology. Torrefaction holds promising characteristics for obtaining a high-energy yield biomass for further processing, including densified biofuels such as pellets and briquettes, at low overall costs, low energy input, and high capacity and availability for the near future, having the capability of displacing coal in power facilities. Despite many efforts in developing the technology at an industrial scale, very few manufacturers and companies are offering torrefied machinery and lignocellulosic torrefied biomass. Furthermore, information about the actual profitability of the business, sensitivity, and costs of torrefied biomass are very scarce and are limited to very focused studies in some areas of the production, but not in the overall supply chain, and manufacturing processes. This study aimed to develop and validate a technical and economic model for the production of lignocellulosic torrefied biomass for its utilization in the solid biofuels industry, with a focus on production and delivered costs for U.S. potential manufacturers. This model also includes analysis of important variables affecting production, such as biomass delivered costs, capital expenditure (CAPEX), and technology availability. Results indicate that the production of torrefied lignocellulosic biomass can be profitable for U.S. manufacturers, subject to a high sensitivity on biomass cost, CAPEX, and technology affordability for large-scale production. Other sensitive facts include carbon credits scenarios, which may influence profitability based on analyses of net present value and internal rate of return for the manufacturing facility.",2013-03-01,10.1007/s12155-012-9255-6,"['Pirraglia, Adrian', 'Gonzalez, Ronalds', 'Denig, Joseph', 'Saloni, Daniel']",BioEnergy Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12155-012-9255-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer
1497,Prospects and Limitations of Biomass Gasification for Industrial Thermal Applications in Sub-Saharan Africa,"The paper presents an evaluation of the prospects and limitations of biomass gasification for small-scale industrial thermal applications in sub-Saharan Africa. The evaluation was done through a review of existing biomass conversion technologies that could be replaced by gasifiers and the availability of potential feedstock fuels, an economic analysis of potential gasification projects under different conditions with the use of RETScreen Clean Energy Project Analysis Software, and highlighting possible solutions to the challenges which the technology faces. The findings show a continued heavy reliance on wood fuels for thermal energy together with a high use of inefficient conversion technologies in industries. Furthermore, significant quantities of agricultural residues remain un-utilized which could substitute about 40 % of wood fuel use in industries. The economic analysis shows that the adoption of gasification technologies is economically viable, due to the high potential for revenues from fuel savings and the associated Green House Gas (GHG) emissions reductions when agricultural residues substitute or supplement the use of wood fuel. Some of the identified limitations of biomass gasification technology include liquidity constraints of the potential users, the lack of local knowledge in the design, manufacture and operation of gasifiers as well as the hazard and safety issues of gasifiers. It can be said that biomass gasification can play a major role in energy efficiency and a shift from the wood fuel dependency in small-scale industries, which is important for the environment and beneficial to the users. However, there is need for incentives such as tax holidays, tax waivers on equipment as well as reduced debt payment rates to enable industries afford the required capital investments. Institutional mechanisms for easy access to carbon credit markets are also necessary as GHG emissions reduction revenues contribute a significant portion of the annual revenues. Also investment in research and development of local skills in the design, manufacture and operation of gasifiers is vital to further reduce the capital investments and ensure proper management of the gasification-related hazard and safety issues.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-37753-2_33,"['Arineitwe, Joseph Ndemere', 'Okure, Mackay', 'Mutyaba, Job', 'Dinesh, Surroop']",Climate-Smart Technologies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-37753-2_33,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer
1498,"An Analysis of the Connection Between Climate Change, Technological Solutions and Potential Disaster Management: The Contribution of Geoengineering Research","In this article, the author uses a critical political economy approach to provide a basic topology of the current state of geoengineering research, funding and testing. The central argument is that the material and discursive monopolisation of geoengineering research and discussion by elite groups—political, economic and scientific-technological—has led to the marginalisation of the public from this debate and has presented a distorted view of its (geoengineering’s) need. Its connection to the main theme of this conference is located in the very clear nexus between climate change, the potentially disastrous outcomes of increased global warming and an examination of the potentially equally dangerous consequences of technologically intensive solutions (like geoengineering) that do not address but disregard the core problem: overconsumption based a resource-extractive and energy-intensive economic system. This piece begins with a brief introduction to geoengineering technologies. I then outline the critical political economy approach which is, at its core, a historically and socially reflexive method that focuses on unpacking the “production and reproduction of…structures” (Mosco 1996 , 29) of privilege, followed by a brief justification of why it is pertinent in this context. Following this, the author delivers a critical snapshot of some of the most striking, and simultaneously troubling, geoengineering research currently taking place worldwide.

1500,The Future of Temperate Agroforestry in the United States,"Agroforestry has been practiced in the United States since the 1930s in the form of windbreaks; however, science-based agroforestry research and practice gained attention only in the1970s. Even then, the progress of agroforestry and its acceptance by practitioners, farmers, and policy makers were hindered by the paucity of hard evidence to support the practice. The scientific foundation that has been laid, over the past decade in particular, has elevated agroforestry’s role as an integral component of a multifunctional working landscape in the United States. Recent trends in the agriculture sector necessitate farm diversification as an essential strategy for economic competitiveness in a global market. The realization that agroforestry systems are well suited for diversifying farm income while providing environmental services and ecosystem benefits has increased receptivity on the part of some landowners. Agroforestry systems offer great promise for the production of biomass for biofuel, specialty and organic crops, pasture-based dairy, and beef, among others. Agroforestry also offers proven strategies for carbon sequestration, soil enrichment, biodiversity conservation, and air and water quality improvement not only for the landowners or farmers but for society at large. The USDA Agroforestry Strategic Framework released in 2011 identifies agroforestry as an important component of a much-needed national strategy to “enhance America’s agricultural landscapes, watersheds, and rural communities.” Minor shifts in national agricultural policy can serve to catalyze the growth of agroforestry further. In an era of environmental sustainability and green business, the realization that agroforestry is an environmentally sound, ecologically sustainable, and economically viable alternative to traditional farming will propel its adoption to newer heights in the coming decades.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-4676-3_14,"['Jose, Shibu', 'Gold, Michael A.', 'Garrett, Harold E.']",Agroforestry - The Future of Global Land Use,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-4676-3_14,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

1505,Using the ecosystem services approach for better planning and conservation of urban green spaces: a Finland case study,"Ecosystem services are vital for humans in urban regions. However, urban development poses a great risk for the ability of ecosystems to provide these services. In this paper we first address the most important ecosystem services in functional urban regions in Finland. Well accessible and good quality recreational ecosystem services, for example, provided by urban nature, are an important part of a high-quality living environment and important for public health. Vegetation of urban regions can have a role in carbon dioxide sequestration and thus in climate change mitigation. For instance, estimates of carbon sinks can be compared to total CO_2 emissions of an urban region, and the municipality can aim at both increasing carbon sinks and decreasing CO_2 emissions with proper land-use planning. Large and contiguous core nature areas, smaller green areas and ecological connections between them are the essence of regional ecological networks and are essential for maintaining interconnected habitats for species and thus biological diversity. Thus, both local and regional level ecological networks are vital for maintaining ecosystem services in urban regions. The impacts of climate change coupled with land-use and land cover change will bring serious challenges for maintaining ecosystem services in urban areas. Although not yet widely used in planning practices, the ecosystem services approach can provide an opportunity for land-use planning to develop ecologically sustainable urban regions. Currently, information on ecosystem services of urban regions is lacking and there is a need to improve the knowledge base for land-use planning.",2010-10-01,10.1007/s10531-010-9888-8,"['Niemelä, Jari', 'Saarela, Sanna-Riikka', 'Söderman, Tarja', 'Kopperoinen, Leena', 'Yli-Pelkonen, Vesa', 'Väre, Seija', 'Kotze, D.

1506,Future Developments,"During the last 200 years, developed countries have shifted their energy consumption toward fossil fuels. Renewable energies have been the primary energy source in the history of the human race. Wood was used for cooking and water and space heating.

1507,Agroforestry for ecosystem services and environmental benefits: an overview,"Agroforestry systems are believed to provide a number of ecosystem services; however, until recently evidence in the agroforestry literature supporting these perceived benefits has been lacking. This special issue brings together a series of papers from around the globe to address recent findings on the ecosystem services and environmental benefits provided by agroforestry. As prelude to the special issue, this paper examines four major ecosystem services and environmental benefits of agroforestry: (1) carbon sequestration, (2) biodiversity conservation, (3) soil enrichment and (4) air and water quality. Past and present evidence clearly indicates that agroforestry, as part of a multifunctional working landscape, can be a viable land-use option that, in addition to alleviating poverty, offers a number of ecosystem services and environmental benefits. This realization should help promote agroforestry and its role as an integral part of a multifunctional working landscape the world over.",2009-05-01,10.1007/s10457-009-9229-7,"['Jose, Shibu']",Agroforestry Systems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10457-009-9229-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

1510,Impacts of climate variability and future climate change on harmful algal blooms and human health,"Anthropogenically-derived increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have been implicated in recent climate change, and are projected to substantially impact the climate on a global scale in the future. For marine and freshwater systems, increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases are expected to increase surface temperatures, lower pH, and cause changes to vertical mixing, upwelling, precipitation, and evaporation patterns. The potential consequences of these changes for harmful algal blooms (HABs) have received relatively little attention and are not well understood. Given the apparent increase in HABs around the world and the potential for greater problems as a result of climate change and ocean acidification, substantial research is needed to evaluate the direct and indirect associations between HABs, climate change, ocean acidification, and human health. This research will require a multidisciplinary approach utilizing expertise in climatology, oceanography, biology, epidemiology, and other disciplines.

Trade-Based Carbon Sequestration Accounting
","This article describes and illustrates an accounting method to assess and compare “early” carbon sequestration investments and trades on the basis of the number of standardized CO_2 emission offset credits they will provide. The “gold standard” for such credits is assumed to be a relatively riskless credit based on a CO_2 emission reduction that provides offsets against CO_2 emissions on a one-for-one basis. The number of credits associated with carbon sequestration needs to account for time, risk, durability, permanence, additionality, and other factors that future trade regulators will most certainly use to assign “official” credits to sequestration projects. The method that is presented here uses established principles of natural resource accounting and conventional rules of asset valuation to “score” projects. A review of 20 “early” voluntary United States based CO_2 offset trades that involve carbon sequestration reveals that the assumptions that buyers, sellers, brokers, and traders are using to characterize the economic potential of their investments and trades vary enormously. The article develops a “universal carbon sequestration credit scoring equation” and uses two of these trades to illustrate the sensitivity of trade outcomes to various assumptions about how future trade auditors are likely to “score” carbon sequestration projects in terms of their “equivalency” with CO_2 emission reductions. The article emphasizes the importance of using a standard credit scoring method that accounts for time and risk to assess and compare even unofficial prototype carbon sequestration trades. The scoring method illustrated in this article is a tool that can protect the integrity of carbon sequestration credit trading and can assist buyers and sellers in evaluating the real economic potential of prospective trades.",2004-08-01,10.1007/s00267-003-9112-7,"['King, Dennis M.']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-003-9112-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

Economic Analyses of Sequestering Carbon in Loblolly Pine, Cherrybark Oak, and Northern Red Oak in the United States","Global concern over increasing carbon dioxide (CO_2) concentrations in the atmosphere leading to possible future climate changes have generated interest in offsetting CO_2 emissions by storing carbon in forests. Carbon-sequestering forest activities may be one of the least expensive approaches to mitigate the build up of atmospheric CO_2. However, the fact that forest management practices are species-, site-and management-objective-specific increases the complexity of using the forestry sector to mitigate global warming. In order to provide useful and timely information concerning carbon sequestration, this study investigated three forestry-based opportunities for sequestering carbon in the United States: conversion of marginal agricultural land to forests and reforestation of poorly stocked pine plantations in the South, afforestation of the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV), and reclamation and afforestation of abandoned mined lands (AML). This study conducted economic analyses on three region–species combinations: loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda L.) in the southern states, cherrybark oak ( Quercus pagoda Raf.) in the LMAV, and northern red oak ( Quercus rubra L.) on AML in West Virginia. The objectives of this study were to determine the profitability of managing these three commercial tree species for timber production only and for the combination of timber production and carbon sequestration and then calculate net tonnes of carbon stored during one rotation and net revenues generated from each tonne of carbon sequestered.",2004-07-01,10.1007/s00267-003-9129-y,"['Huang, Ching-Hsun', 'Bates, Richard', 'Kronrad, Gary D.', 'Cheng, Shiaolin']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-003-9129-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit market"")",springer

The purpose of this study is to assess and discuss the current state and trends of North American forest resources, sustainable forest management, and their implications for forest sustainability. Recent Findings Recent information indicates that forest sustainability in North America is not under threat. Forest area, inventory, and carbon stocks have been increasing while wood harvest has been declining. Large expanses of forest resources are covered by management plans, and many forests are certified. The areas of concern include forest fires and bark beetle infestations in primarily public forests in the western USA and Canada, and continued loss of forest cover in Mexico. Summary Despite progress made in gathering information on forest resources, evaluating forest sustainability remains challenging. Practicing sustainable forest management is made difficult by unfavorable market conditions and the ensuing lack of funding, challenges in developing and implementing forest management plans, and uncertainties including potential impacts of climate change, population growth, and changing markets.",2018-09-01,10.1007/s40725-018-0079-2,"['Siry, Jacek P.', 'Cubbage, Frederick W.', 'Potter, Kevin M.', 'McGinley, Kathleen']",Current Forestry Reports,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40725-018-0079-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions offset mitigation"")",springer

The authors start with their finding that most research into alternative agri-food networks takes a strictly informative, cursory look at the conditions under which these networks are gradually created. They then explain how the sociology of market agencements analyzes the construction of innovative markets and how it can be used in agri-food studies. The relevance of this theoretical frame is shown based on an experiment aimed at creating a local trade scheme between manure from livestock farms and alfalfa grown by grain farmers. By using the concepts of the sociology of market agencements, the authors reveal the operations that are required to create an alternative agri-food network and underscore the difficulties that attend each one of these operations.

This comprehensive Agenda 2030 specifies the vision about “the future we want”. Ending extreme poverty Poverty , stopping climate change and the loss of biodiversity Biodiversity will fundamentally change economic framework conditions and will be disruptive for many industries and companies. In the absence of a global government Government successful implementation of the SDGs is only possible with a concept of shared responsibility: Not only government policy but also the contribution of all stakeholder groups Stakeholder groups is necessary. In this article the (potential) roles of companies and of universities are addressed. The focus is on analyzing the impact of two UN-related organizations Organizations — the UN Global Compact UN Global Compact (UN GC) and PRME (Principles for Responsible Management Education) Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) —on the engagement of these two stakeholders Stakeholders respectively.

1517,Modeling the impact of climate change on energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of buildings in Iran,"In this study, it has been attempted to quantify model climate change effects of the coming decades on energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions of a dominant building brigade under hot and humid climates on the southern coast of Iran, based on three stations of Bushehr, Bandar Abbas and Chabahar. In this research, the Meteonorm and DesignBuilder software have been used for climate and thermal simulation of building. One of the results of this study is the increase in temperature and relative humidity for the coming decades for all three study stations. The findings of this study showed that the average annual temperature for the 2060s compared to the present decade, will increase by 2.82 °C for Bandar Abbas, by 2.79 °C for Bushehr and for Chabahar it will reach 2.14 °C. This increase in temperature has led to an increase in discomfort warmer days and a decrease in discomfort cold days. But given the climatic type of the area, a decrease in the heating energy demand for the coming decades will not have a significant effect on the pattern of energy consumption inside buildings. Because for two stations of Bandar Abbas and Chabahar, more than 95% of the energy demand for the 2060s is for cooling energy demand, which is about 80% of energy for Bushehr. In total, due to the increased demand for cooling energy in the coming decades, this will further increase carbon dioxide emissions, which is higher in Chabahar than in other study stations.",2019-12-01,10.1007/s40201-019-00406-6,"['Roshan, Gholamreza', 'Arab, Maryam', 'Klimenko, Vladimir']",Journal of Environmental Health Science and Engineering,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40201-019-00406-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions market"")",springer
1518,Measuring the risk of European carbon market: an empirical mode decomposition-based value at risk approach,"Unlike common financial markets, the European carbon market is a typically heterogeneous market, characterized by multiple timescales and affected by extreme events. The traditional Value-at-Risk (VaR) with single-timescale fails to deal with the multi-timescale characteristics and the effects of extreme events, which can result in the VaR overestimation for carbon market risk. To measure accurately the risk on the European carbon market, we propose an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based multiscale VaR approach. Firstly, the EMD algorithm is utilized to decompose the carbon price return into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different timescales and a residue, which are modeled respectively using the ARMA–EGARCH model to obtain their conditional variances at different timescales. Furthermore, the Iterated Cumulative Sums of Squares algorithm is employed to determine the windows of an extreme event, so as to identify the IMFs influenced by an extreme event and conduct an exponentially weighted moving average on their conditional variations. Finally, the VaRs of various IMFs and the residue are estimated to reconstruct the overall VaR, the validity of which is verified later. Then, we illustrate the results by considering several European carbon futures contracts. Compared with the traditional VaR framework with single timescale, the proposed multiscale VaR–EMD model can effectively reduce the influences of the heterogeneous environments (such as the influences of extreme events), and obtain a more accurate overall risk measure on the European carbon market. By acquiring the distributions of carbon market risks at different timescales, the proposed multiscale VaR–EMD estimation is capable of understanding the fluctuation characteristics more comprehensively, which can provide new perspectives for exploring the evolution law of the risks on the European carbon market.",2019-10-01,10.1007/s10479-018-2982-0,"['Zhu, Bangzhu', 'Ye, Shunxin', 'He, Kaijian', 'Chevallier, Julien', 'Xie, Rui']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-018-2982-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions market"")",springer

The study assumes that in a departure from the classical Bertrand game, there is still a market for both firms’ goods regardless of the product price, even though production capacity is limited by carbon emissions regulation. Through the decentralized decision making of both firms under perfect information, the results are unstable. The firm with the lower maximum production capacity under carbon emissions regulation and the firm with the higher maximum production capacity both seek market price cooperation. By designing an internal carbon credits trading mechanism, we can ensure that the production capacity of the firm with the higher maximum production capacity under carbon emissions regulation reaches price equilibrium. Also, the negotiation power of the duopoly would affect the price equilibrium.",2019-06-01,10.1007/s11356-017-8767-1,"['Jian, Ming', 'He, Hua', 'Ma, Changsong', 'Wu, Yan', 'Yang, Hao']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-017-8767-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions market"")",springer

Comprehensively evaluating the efficiency of China’s eight carbon trading pilots is vital for strengthening the construction of its national ETS. This paper investigates the weak-form efficiency of eight carbon trading markets in China. We use a series of variance ratio tests to identify the efficiency from the market set up to the May 4, 2018, of all markets. The results indicate that the majority of the carbon trading markets are inefficient and only Beijing, Hubei, and Fujian markets are efficient. The China’s carbon trading market is gradually maturing and implemented. In addition, we analyze the factors have impact on the market efficiency. It shows that the liquidity, volume, allocation allowance, and transparency in information are significant factors; meanwhile, the regional policy and cross cooperation also are important factors.

1522,Multi-stage emissions management of a steel company,"We present a multi-stage model for determining the optimal production and emissions coverage for an industrial company participating in the European Emissions Trading System. This model is adapted for a real-life European steel company. A mean-multiperiod CVaR is used as a decision criterion. There are two stochastic parameters—market demand for products and emissions allowance price. The aim of this paper is to explore the costs and risk of a company caused by emissions trading. The presented model is solved for various values of the risk aversion parameters and initial price of the allowance. As a result, it is found that the production is little influenced by the price of allowances and it nearly does not depend on risk-aversion. The probability of the company’s default, on the other hand, is significantly influenced by the emission prices. Futures on allowances as well as banking (i.e., transferring allowances between periods) are used to reduce the risks of the emissions trading. We further exploit the same situation under different settings, namely, given random price margins, and time-dependent, deterministic and positively contaminated distributions of demand. In all these cases, the results follow patterns similar to those given the original setting.",2019-03-12,10.1007/s10479-019-03192-4,"['Zapletal, František', 'Šmíd, Martin', 'Kopa, Miloš']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-019-03192-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions market"")",springer

Some authors claim that MCDM techniques are highly suitable in multidimensional frameworks when aggregating single indicators into a composite one, since this process involves making choices when combining criteria of different natures, and it requires a number of steps in which decisions must be made. In this paper, we conduct a literature review of papers published after 2002 in leading international journals indexed in a recognised database (JCR), in order to identify the different MCDM methods used for aggregating single indicators into composite ones.

While Green GDP calculations have the advantage of making costs and gains of economic growth transparent, the big data which form the basis of Green GDP calculations imply that everything we do has to be quantified and controlled. Introducing Green GDP calculations is a continuation of GDP-ism with other means and no break away from the kind of mindset which stands at the cradle of the Anthropocene.

Models based on aligning the benefits of a given municipal service with those who pay for it are of limited use, as the beneficiaries of urban climate change efforts are simultaneously local and global. Cities have been able to tailor traditional financing mechanisms (such as property taxes and user fees) to incentivize citizens to reduce their carbon footprints while generating the resources necessary to fund local climate change projects. However, given the unconventional and global nature of climate change as an urban policy area, cities will likely benefit by looking beyond the formal intergovernmental institutions that structure cities’ financing abilities. This chapter advocates applying a multilevel governance lens that recognizes the importance of new, outside actors that operate at both the local and global scales to climate change financing solutions. By acknowledging the important relationship between municipal finance and the broader multilevel frameworks that govern climate change policy, cities have the opportunity to pursue innovations in municipal finance to support their climate change objectives.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-65003-6_14,"['Peterson, Jacqueline']",Climate Change in Cities,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-65003-6_14,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions market"")",springer
1531,Aggregated impact of allowance allocation and power dispatching on emission reduction,"Climate change has become one of the most important issues for the sustainable development of social well-being. China has made great efforts in reducing CO_2 emissions and promoting clean energy. Pilot Emission Trading Systems (ETSs) have been launched in two provinces and five cities in China, and a national level ETS will be implemented in the third quarter of 2017, with preparations for China’s national ETS now well under way. In the meantime, a new round of China’s electric power system reform has entered the implementation stage. Policy variables from both electricity and emission markets will impose potential risks on the operation of generation companies (GenCos). Under this situation, by selecting key variables in each domain, this paper analyzes the combined effects of different allowance allocation methods and power dispatching models on power system emission. Key parameters are set based on a provincial power system in China, and the case studies are conducted based on dynamic simulation platform for macro-energy systems (DSMES) software developed by the authors. The selected power dispatching models include planned dispatch, energy saving power generation dispatch and economic dispatch. The selected initial allowance allocation methods in the emission market include the grandfathering method based on historical emissions and the benchmarking method based on actual output. Based on the simulation results and discussions, several policy implications are highlighted to help to design an effective emission market in China.",2017-11-01,10.1007/s40565-017-0321-0,"['JIANG, Chao', 'XUE, Yusheng', 'HUANG, Jie', 'XUE, Feng', 'WEN, Fushuan', 'LI, Kang']",Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40565-017-0321-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions market"")",springer
1532,Theorizing command-and-commodify regulation: the case of species conservation banking in the United States,"State-directed but market-oriented forms of regulation, especially environmental examples like cap-and-trade and ecological offsetting, have proliferated in the past two decades, but sociologists have been slow to theorize these broad institutional shifts. This article offers a framework for explaining these processes of regulatory marketization. First, I argue that institutions of this sort are examples of what I call command-and-commodify regulation, a mode of regulation that distinctively hybridizes economic and authoritative dimensions of power. Second, I explain how and why one example of command-and-commodify regulation, species conservation banking, emerged and remained concentrated in California, but did not so easily develop in other American states. Finally, abstracting from the case, I argue that the concept of market reconstruction is useful for developing a more general theory of the ways that social conflicts and mobilization reconfigure regulatory power and thus give rise to new modes of regulation. Together, a theory of command-and-commodify regulation and market reconstruction may be useful for explaining the development of a wide variety of environmentally focused and other regulatory institutions.",2017-05-01,10.1007/s11186-017-9283-5,"['Rea, Christopher M.']",Theory and Society,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11186-017-9283-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions market"")",springer

1535,Market Power in Emission Permit Markets: Theory and Evidence from the EU ETS,"A well-known result about market power in emission permit markets is that efficiency can be achieved by full free allocation to the dominant firm. I show that this result breaks down when taking the interaction between input and output markets into account, even if the dominant firm perceives market power in the permit market alone. I then examine the empirical evidence for price manipulation by the ten largest electricity firms during phase I of the EU ETS. I find that some firms’ excess allowance holdings are consistent with strategic price manipulation, and that they cannot be explained by price speculation or by precautionary purchases to insure against uncertain future emissions. My results suggest that market power is likely to be an empirically relevant concern during the early years of emission permit markets.",2017-01-01,10.1007/s10640-015-9939-4,"['Hintermann, Beat']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-015-9939-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions market"")",springer
1536,Combination of wet irrigation and nitrification inhibitor reduced nitrous oxide and methane emissions from a rice cropping system,"To conserve water resources and guarantee food security, a new technology termed as “wet irrigation” is developed and practiced in rice fields; thus, its impact on radiative forcing derived from nitrous oxide (N_2O) and methane (CH_4) emissions merits serious attention. Dicyandiamide (DCD), a kind of nitrification inhibitor, is proposed as a viable means to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission while enhancing crop productivity. However, little is known about the response of GHG emission and grain yield to DCD application in a rice system under wet irrigation. In these regard, effects of water regime and DCD application on CH_4 and N_2O emissions, grain yield, global warming potential (GWP), and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) from rice fields were studied. For this study, a field experiment, designed: Treatment II (intermittent irrigation), Treatment WI (wet irrigation), Treatment IID (II plus DCD), and Treatment WID (WI plus DCD), was conducted in Jurong, Jiangsu Province, China, from 2011 to 2012. Relative to Treatment II, Treatment WI decreased CH_4 emission significantly by 49–71 % while increasing N_2O emission by 33–72 %. By integrating CH_4 and N_2O emissions and grain yield, Treatment WI was 20–28 and 11–15 % lower than Treatment II in GWP and GHGI, respectively. The use of DCD under wet irrigation reduced N_2O emission significantly by 25–38 % ( p  < 0.05) and CH_4 emission by 7–8 %, relative to Treatment WI, resulting in a decline of 18–30 % in GWP. Due to the increase in N use efficiency, maximal grain yield (6–7 %) and minimal GHGI (22–34 %) was observed in Treatment WID. These findings indicate that combined application of N fertilizer and DCD is a win-win strategy in water-saving high-yield rice production with less GHG emission.",2016-09-01,10.1007/s11356-016-6936-2,"['Liu, Gang', 'Yu, Haiyang', 'Zhang, Guangbin', 'Xu, Hua', 'Ma, Jing']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-016-6936-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions market"")",springer

Our analysis uses the wavelet method to model the correlation between CER and EUA in the time-frequency domain. It highlights the impact of different investors (according to their investment horizons) on the co-movement between the CER and EUA prices, and therefore, the behavior of individual investors as speculators, arbitrageurs, and hedgers on European allowance and CDM credits cumulatively.

We verify that analysts do strive to forecast announcements accurately but that our scheduled public announcements nevertheless indeed do contain important surprise components. Our findings suggest that the preponderance of the order imbalance related information assimilation in carbon emission rights occurs within 5 min of the German (DE NO) and European Union new order (EU NO), European Union industrial production (EU IP) and United States non-farm payroll (US NFP) scheduled announcements. This is new evidence of information assimilation in the carbon emissions market. The extent of information assimilation is documented for 15 min both before and after each announcement in contiguous 5-min windows, and relative to same time interval observations on non-announcement days.

1539,"Changing Paradigms, Shifting Societal Discourses, and Organizational Responses","This chapter begins with a description of the transformational changes undertaken at the Portland Trail Blazers’ basketball arena campus when messages within their external environment changed to highlight environmental sustainability. Two paradigms generally used to describe the belief systems of people and people groups regarding our relationship with the natural environment are described: the dominant social paradigm and the new ecological paradigm. The societal shift toward the growing importance of the sustainable development Discourse within businesses, cities, and universities is described. Paradigms are differentiated from Discourses and ten environment-related Discourses are identified (i.e., the industrialism Discourse , survivalism, the Promethean response, administrative rationalism, democratic pragmatism, economic rationalism, green politics, green consciousness, ecological modernization, and sustainability). Criticisms of the ecological modernism and sustainability Discourses are reviewed. Communication’s role in reinforcing and challenging paradigms is discussed. The chapter ends by discussing forces which influence how environmentally related issues are framed, contested, and reframed. In addition to paradigms, Discourses , and ideology, theories or theoretical concepts highlighted include discursive closure, critical theory and the neo-Marxian perspective on sustainable development, framing, schemata of interpretation, systematically distorted communication, and social judgment theory. Throughout the chapter, interview data gathered from small businesses, an activist organization (the Natural Resources Defense Council), a nongovernmental organization, South Dakota’s state government, multiple cities (e.g., the City and County of Denver), two sports organizations (the Portland Trail Blazers, Aspen Skiing Company), a university, and two multinational organizations (Tyson Foods, Sam’s Club) is integrated.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-18005-2_2,"['Allen, Myria']",Strategic Communication for Sustainable Organizations,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-18005-2_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions market"")",springer

This study provides possible implications for other provinces or municipalities at a local level in China and other developing countries preparing for, or in the process of, facilitating trading platforms for forest carbon sinks at a national level. This chapter also provides a comparison of the development of voluntary forestry carbon sinks in Yunnan and Zhejiang Provinces.

1542,On the Stochastic Properties of Carbon Futures Prices,"Pricing carbon is a central concern in environmental economics, due to the worldwide importance of emissions trading schemes to regulate pollution. This paper documents the presence of small and large jumps in the stochastic process of the CO $$_2$$ 2 futures price. The large jumps have a discrete origin, i.e. they can arise from various demand factors or institutional decisions on the tradable permits market. Contrary to the existing literature, we show that the stochastic process of carbon futures prices does not contain a continuous component (Brownian motion). The results are derived by using high-frequency data in the activity signature function framework (Todorov and Tauchen in J Econom 154:125–138, 2010 ; Todorov and Tauchen in J Bus Econ Stat 29:356–371, 2011 ). The implication is that the carbon futures price should be modeled as an appropriately sampled, centered Lévy or Poisson process. The pure-jump behavior of the carbon price might be explained by the lower volume of trades on this allowance market (compared to other highly liquid financial markets).",2014-05-01,10.1007/s10640-013-9695-2,"['Chevallier, Julien', 'Sévi, Benoît']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-013-9695-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions market"")",springer

1549,Carbon dioxide abatement costs and permit price: exploring the impact of banking and the role of future commitments,"Since the signing of the Kyoto Protocol in December 1997, several studies have estimated the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by the amount specified in the Protocol, as well as the price of the permits. A number of authors have recently shown that, following the US withdrawal and the Bonn and Marrakesh agreements, these abatement costs will be very low and the price of the permits could reach zero. However, these analyses usually take only the first commitment period (2008–2012) into account and do not explicitly consider the possibility of banking permits from one commitment period to the other (Art. 3.13 of the Protocol). The simple dynamic model that we develop here introduces this possibility. It allows one to analyze the impact of alternative future commitments for the US and the non-Annex B countries on world emissions, abatement costs, and the permit price. We find that, provided ambituous post-Kyoto commitments are negotiated: (1) in 2008–2012, the number of banked permits will largely exceed the amount of hot air and permit prices will be much higher than predicted by most other studies, (2) the banking provision significantly reduces world total costs but increases total costs for all permit-importing Annex B countries (i.e., all Annex B countries except those of eastern Europe) via a rise in the permit price in 2008–2017, and (3) the issue of market power on hot air is not likely to be relevant.",2005-06-01,10.1007/BF03353946,"['Steenberghe, Vincent']",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/BF03353946,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions market"")",springer
1550,International institutions and the framing of domestic policies: The Kyoto Protocol and Canada's response to climate change,"The 1997 Kyoto Protocol establishes an international institutional framework for domestic responses to climate change that links emission targets for developed countries to international market mechanisms. Although these ‘flexible mechanisms’ allow developed countries some leeway in how they meet their commitments to reduce greenhouse gases, the protocol also establishes a normative framework that directs domestic policy responses along certain paths. Applying insights from sociological institutionalism and constructivism in international relations, this article argues first, that the climate change regime reflects and further institutionalizes the prevailing international normative structure in the environmental issue area, characterized as ‘liberal environmentalism.’ Second, these norms, as embodied in the climate change regime, have enabled and constrained climate change policy development in Canada, one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases per capita. International norms can shape or redefine domestic interests, enable policies in conformity with those norms, and create normative pressures for change by linking with extant domestic and foreign policy norms. Uncovering this international institutional-domestic policy interaction resolves the paradox of Canada's promotion of commitments and mechanisms consistent with its domestic interests and institutional constraints, but eventual commitment to action well beyond what those constraints dictate. This commitment continues despite Kyoto's uncertain future. The findings also point to lacunae in the literature on regime compliance and effectiveness more broadly, especially its dominant rationalist variant.",2002-06-01,10.1023/A:1016158505323,"['Bernstein, Steven']",Policy Sciences,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1016158505323,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions market"")",springer

1552,Economic Analysis of Carbon Removal Strategy by Fusion–Biomass Hybrid System in the Future Market Mechanism,"Since the low-carbon technology fusion energy is scheduled to be commercialized beyond 2050, the late-mover needs to flexibly and strategically operate for sustainable cash flow responding to the future market mechanism. Carbon sequestration of the fusion–biomass hybrid system by using low-temperature heat is proposed under the two preconditions: the establishment of the deregulated electricity market, and the emission trading market. When the price is above the breakeven price, the hybrid system generates electricity; otherwise, charcoal production is performed. Charcoal production is a stable solid form of carbon capture, and can possibly be traded on the emission credit market to secure profit. The experimental result shows that it is possible to produce charcoal at low temperature of 280 °C, indicating that any type of blanket design is applicable in the hybrid system concept. The carbon sequestration cost is 39 $/tCO_2 at the default parameter of net electric output of 4000 $/kW_e for the fusion power plant, and 60% of charcoal yield from experimental result. Comparison between the hybrid system and the fusion power plant proves that the fusion–biomass hybrid system prevents further loss, by setting two-track income structures in the various market mechanisms.",2020-04-01,10.1007/s10894-019-00229-1,"['Nam, Hoseok', 'Mukai, Keisuke', 'Yagi, Juro', 'Konishi, Satoshi']",Journal of Fusion Energy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10894-019-00229-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit market"")",springer

1554,Carbon emission right as a new property right: rescue CDM developers in China from 2012,"Clean development mechanism (CDM) is encountering many uncertainties due to the coming end of the commitment period and critically suggested reformation. As the largest participant in the CDM market, China shoulders the biggest proportion of market risk. Among the studies on CDM in China, few have focused upon the legal aspect of CDM, which is crucial in defending developers’ interests. To fill this research gap in making the transition from policy to law, this paper claims that carbon emission right, which is the basis of trade, should be attributed as a property right in Property Law of People’s Republic of China. The present study will discuss the characteristics of carbon emission, definition, and legal attribution of carbon emission right. The valid object of carbon emission right in the CDM market under Property Law should be certified emissions reductions (CERs). The usufructuary right could be specifically applied in practice to the owners’ property right on CERs in China. Although experience from the CDM is not fully applicable to the development of cap and trading, the success of CDM market provides a reasonable platform to study emission right in the view of legal science. Furthermore, the proposed research acts as the pioneer study that lay the theoretical foundations in legal science on emission right trading for other potential schemes, which in turn addresses international environmental issues.",2013-09-01,10.1007/s10784-012-9191-0,"['Pei, Qing', 'Liu, Lanlan', 'Zhang, David D.']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-012-9191-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions credit market"")",springer

Traditionally, the maintenance of scattered trees on farm to reap several tangible and intangible benefits is a way of life. Presently, these systems are often known as low-hanging fruit and become a key weapon to fight climate change evil by offsetting greenhouse gas (GHG) emission through carbon sequestration. Therefore, to quantify the offsetting potential of GHG emission and area occupied by these tree-based systems in Rajasthan was undertaken. The study was carried out into two major aspects: estimation of agroforestry area using satellite remote sensing data, and to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of existing agroforestry by using dynamic CO2FIXv3.1 model for a simulation period of 30-years in five districts (20% sampling), namely, Bikaner, Dausa, Jhunjhunu, Pali and Sikar from Rajasthan, India. The estimated area under agroforestry in Rajasthan was 1.49 million ha. The findings revealed that the major tree species existing on farmer’s field were Prosopis cineraria, Tecomella undulata , Capparis decidua, Acacia tortilis , Prosopis juliflora , Azadirachta indica and Ziziphus mauritiana with an observed number of trees in selected districts varied from 1.40 to 14.90 ha^−1(with average tree density of 9.71 ha^−1). The total biomass (tree + Crop) varied from 2.22 to 19.19 Mg ha^−1, whereas the total biomass carbon ranged from 1.00 to 8.64 Mg C ha^−1. The soil organic carbon ranged from 4.51 to 16.50 Mg C ha^−1. The average estimated carbon sequestration and mitigation potential of the agroforestry were 0.26 Mg C ha^−1 year^−1and 0.95 Mg CO_2 eq ha^−1 year^−1 on farmers' field of Rajasthan. At the state level, the reduction of GHG emission potential of agroforestry was found to be 1.42 million tonnes annually, which helps to cut carbon footprint and achieve targets of Paris agreement.",2020-06-01,10.1007/s10668-020-00788-w,"['Chavan, S.

1557,The economic and environmental analysis of energy production from slaughterhouse waste in Saudi Arabia,"Abstract The waste generated from animal slaughtering increases significantly during the Hajj period due to increased meat consumption as well as performing the religious ritual of animal slaughtering. It is estimated that about 12% of waste per body weight of sheep and goat is generated, while 43% waste of cattle body weight is generated. There are no robust data available about the slaughtering waste generation in KSA. However, it is apparent that huge amounts of waste are generated and disposed of to the landfills without any material and energy recovery. This study estimates that slaughtering activity generated about 0.08 million tons of solid waste in 2016, which will reach up to 0.2 million tons in 2030. The slaughtering activity includes both domestic and international visitors (Umrah and Hajj pilgrims) meat demand along with holly ritual of animal sacrifice on Eid Ul Adha (religious festival). The study assesses the economic feasibility of two scenarios for waste-to-energy production utilizing slaughterhouse waste as input material through sustainable waste management practices. The gross revenue obtained from the waste management facility includes gate fee saving (45 to 114 MSAR) by waste diversion, environmental saving (8 to 20 MSAR) in the form of carbon credits, power generation potential from biogas, biodiesel, glycerol, MBM (scenario I: 14 to 35 MSAR, scenario II: 21 to 52 MSAR) and selling price of the equivalent amount of fossil resources (scenario I: 46 to 117 MSAR; scenario II: 52 to 132 SAR) from 2016 till 2030. In general, the revenue contribution potentials of scenario I and scenario II to the national economic circle will be 288 MSAR and 319 MSAR in 2030, correspondingly. Although preliminary investigations of both scenarios reveal the considerable potential of implementing transesterification and anaerobic digestion for the sustainable management of slaughterhouse waste in Makkah, further in-depth studies in accordance with local geographic, socioeconomic and cultural values are also recommended.

1559,Aboveground Carbon Stocks in Rapidly Expanding Mangroves in New Zealand: Regional Assessment and Economic Valuation of Blue Carbon,"Blue carbon is increasingly being considered in global carbon budgets; however, there is poor understanding of how carbon stocks vary within mangrove forests with heterogeneous growth forms and in areas where mangroves are showing rapid changes in distribution. Here, field measurements and LiDAR data were used to estimate aboveground carbon stocks and economic benefits of Avicennia marina in the Auckland Region, New Zealand, where the mangrove area has increased at an annual rate of 3.2% since 1940. Multiple allometric equations were explored to determine best fits for different growth forms (tall and dwarf mangroves) that minimised uncertainty in conversions of tree size to aboveground carbon stock estimates. Across the Auckland Region, the mean total aboveground carbon stock (including trees, seedling, pneumatophores and woody debris) was 40.2 Mg C ha^−1 with over 75% contained in tree biomass. Total aboveground carbon stocks varied considerably between mangrove growth form (tall and dwarf mangroves) and hydrodynamic conditions (estuarine, riverine and delta mangroves). Total aboveground carbon storage across the Auckland Region amounted to 384,451 Mg C with an economic value of US$ 70 million. This study demonstrates that LiDAR data can be used to produce reliable and high-resolution tree carbon stock estimates in estuaries characterised by spatially variable distributions of dwarf mangroves. These estimates are critical for the incorporation of mangroves into national blue carbon accounting schemes.",2020-04-05,10.1007/s12237-020-00736-x,"['Suyadi', 'Gao, Jay', 'Lundquist, Carolyn J.', 'Schwendenmann, Luitgard']",Estuaries and Coasts,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12237-020-00736-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1560,Loss-On-Ignition Estimates for Soil Organic Carbon in Great Lakes Freshwater Coastal Wetlands,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important component of freshwater wetlands that may be used to quantify ecosystem services and prioritize conservation efforts. Measuring SOC directly via elemental analysis is often time and cost-prohibitive. Loss-on-ignition (LOI) is a rapid and low-cost method for determining soil organic matter; however, LOI data must be converted to SOC data using a soil type-specific regression model and no models currently exist for freshwater coastal wetlands. To address this gap, we performed regression analyses that convert percent organic matter measured from LOI to SOC for freshwater coastal wetlands in the southern basin of Lake Michigan. Analyses across 6 Lake Michigan wetlands provide a regression model capable of estimating SOC within ±3.5% uncertainty (r^2 = 0.757), a threshold useful for wetland management and large-scale soil surveys. Future research should explore the LOI-SOC relationship at other freshwater coastal wetlands – to investigate whether the correlation values found here are typical of these systems and to refine our regression model using data from disparate freshwater locales.",2020-03-07,10.1007/s13157-020-01270-z,"['Braun, Katherine N.', 'Theuerkauf, Ethan J.', 'Hurtgen, Matthew T.', 'Masterson, Andrew L.', 'Horton, Daniel E.']",Wetlands,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13157-020-01270-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer

The entire Westphalian system is underwritten by finance. Yet, can the blind lead the blind? Despite being more than $22 trillion in debt (and technically impossible to ever repay this, even with roaring economic growth year-on-end) the US dollar, US financial system access, and US debt obligations all underpin the world’s finances. Those who have the gold make the rules is an appropriate saying. All ascriptions to US dollar-denominated debt instruments, such as bonds and stocks, are subject to US rules and laws, which have a global reach. As most countries’ sovereign debt holdings are in US dollars, the US then becomes not only the world’s de facto economic ruler, but also its enforcer. It is only logical then that any global solution for public goods problems (i.e., climate change, plastic waste, etc.), cross border finance, or economic policies priced or funded in dollars would be subject to US rules.

1564,Integrating Sustainability in Governance and Legal Framework for a Sustainable Builtscape in Kenya: Towards a Global Approach,"This paper evaluates the adequacy of Kenya’s subsidiary legislation to support a transition towards enforceable sustainable construction regulations. Informed by the Green Legal Theory and Legal Theory of Sustainable Development it provides an international comparison among Kenya and United Kingdom legislation in their implementation of legal principles of sustainability in the construction industry. It particularly examines in this way the level of fusion of sustainability in laws governing the construction sector in Kenya. The paper establishes a lack of a sustainable construction strategy and that the Kenya Government is yet to make sustainability a core subject in the construction industry operations. Sustainability is therefore not a living element in the legal framework governing the construction sector in Kenya. The fragmented nature of the Kenya industry has impacted leadership and governance consequently left sustainable construction for voluntary uptake. The paper outlines findings from the literature review related to Kenya’s rule of Law and makes policy recommendations as well as other tangible solutions for a holistic integration of sustainability in the construction industry in Kenya. As a proactive measure, embracing sustainable development now will keep emissions of emerging economies on the low in the face of future growth and development.

1566,The Clean Development Mechanism and large dam development: contradictions associated with climate financing in Cambodia,"Since 2000, the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has been facilitating climate change financing in support of large hydropower dam development. Although the CDM was designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable development, it has financed hydropower dams that have caused serious environmental and social impacts. We consider the case of the Lower Sesan 2 dam in northeastern Cambodia, the largest and most environmentally and socially damaging hydropower dam ever built in Cambodia. LS2 has not received climate change financing through the CDM, as four other large dams in Cambodia have, because the market price for carbon credits is too low to justify the expense required to apply for them. However, it could be registered to receive climate financing post-construction. We highlight the apparent lack of improvements in critical areas of the CDM despite years of criticisms and suggest that there are framing and structural issues that will make reforming the CDM difficult. This topic is particularly timely because the CDM is scheduled to end in 2020, after which time it will be replaced by a new but yet unspecified climate change financing mechanism.",2019-12-03,10.1007/s10584-019-02621-4,"['Baird, Ian G.', 'Green, W.

1567,Optimizing sequestered carbon in forest offset programs: balancing accounting stringency and participation,"Background Although there is broad agreement that negative carbon emissions may be required in order to meet the global climate change targets specified in the Paris Agreement and that carbon sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere can be an important contributor, there are important accounting issues that often discourage forest carbon sequestration projects. The legislation establishing the California forest offset program, for example, requires that offsets be “real, additional, quantifiable, permanent, verifiable, and enforceable”. While these are all clearly desirable attributes, their implementation has been a great challenge in balancing complexity, expense, and risk. Most forest offset protocols carry similar accounting objectives, but often with different details, (e.g. Richards and Huebner in Carbon Manag 3(4):393–410, 2012 and Galik et al. in Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change 14:677–690, 2009). The result is that the complexity, expense, and risk of participation discourage participation and make it more difficult to achieve climate mitigation goals. We focus on the requirements for accounting and permanence to illustrate that current requirements disproportionately disadvantage small landowners. Results The simplified 1040EZ filing system for U.S. income taxes may provide insight for a protocol model that balances reward, effort, and risk, while still achieving the overall objectives of standardized offset protocols. In this paper, we present initial ideas and lay the groundwork behind a “2050EZ” protocol for forest carbon sequestration as a complement to existing protocols. Conclusion The Paris Agreement states that “Parties should take action to conserve and enhance, as appropriate, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases.” The Paris Agreement also refers to issues such as equity, sustainable development, and other non-carbon benefits. The challenge is to provide incentives for maintaining and increasing the amount of carbon sequestered in the biosphere. Monitoring and verification of carbon storage need to be sufficient to demonstrate sequestration from the atmosphere while providing clear incentives and simple accounting approaches that encourage participation by diverse participants, including small land holders.",2019-12-03,10.1186/s13021-019-0131-y,"['Wise, Lindsey', 'Marland, Eric', 'Marland, Gregg', 'Hoyle, Jason', 'Kowalczyk, Tamara', 'Ruseva, Tatyana', 'Colby, Jeffrey', 'Kinlaw, Timothy']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13021-019-0131-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1568,Reducing greenhouse gas emissions: a duopoly market pricing competition and cooperation under the carbon emissions cap,"This article studies the price competition and cooperation in a duopoly that is subjected to carbon emissions cap. The study assumes that in a departure from the classical Bertrand game, there is still a market for both firms’ goods regardless of the product price, even though production capacity is limited by carbon emissions regulation. Through the decentralized decision making of both firms under perfect information, the results are unstable. The firm with the lower maximum production capacity under carbon emissions regulation and the firm with the higher maximum production capacity both seek market price cooperation. By designing an internal carbon credits trading mechanism, we can ensure that the production capacity of the firm with the higher maximum production capacity under carbon emissions regulation reaches price equilibrium. Also, the negotiation power of the duopoly would affect the price equilibrium.",2019-06-01,10.1007/s11356-017-8767-1,"['Jian, Ming', 'He, Hua', 'Ma, Changsong', 'Wu, Yan', 'Yang, Hao']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-017-8767-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1569,Methodology for Estimating the Cost of Delay in Architectural Engineering Projects: Case of Metro Rails in India,"Development of a nation is directly related to the accomplishment of public infrastructure projects. They cater to the objectives of sector-specific demand and accrue benefits in other related fields. These architectural engineering projects contribute to the overall development, which is complex to measure in tangible terms alone, but call for establishing indicators for measuring intangible benefits as well. Delay in projects is considered to affect the tangible cost benefits. It is, however, a limited perception of delay consequences. The cost of delay (CoD), therefore, can be determined by considering the overall impact of tangible and intangible benefits of such projects. This paper brings out the framework for determining the CoD for the selected case study of a metro rail project. It reflects the consequences of delay in overall development prospects and high-level infrastructure objectives by establishing the CoD. The cost thus established can serve as the basis for mobilizing additional resources and strategic decision making in the best interest of overall benefits.

1570,Modeling the height–diameter relationship and volume of young African mahoganies established in successional agroforestry systems in northeastern Brazil,"The aim of this study was to fit and select height–diameter and stem volume equations for two African mahogany species ( Khaya ivorensis and Khaya anthotheca ) in the initial development phase (between 2 and 5 years old), established in agroforestry systems in northeastern Brazil. We used linear and nonlinear models to predict the total height (h) and stem volume (v), based on data from forest inventories and stem measurements of standing trees. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) the simple linear model is the most accurate to estimate the total height of young African mahogany trees in relation to different types of height–diameter models (linearized, nonlinear and those with transformed variables); (2) simple and double-entry stem volume models have the same precision in estimating the individual volume of young African mahogany trees. The results showed that the simple linear height–diameter model was most accurate to estimate the height of both African mahogany species. The age’s effect (young trees) and probably the predominantly monopodial development of the Khaya spp. trees sampled were discussed as the causes of the linear nature of the models that best described the height–diameter relationship. The stem volume equations for Khaya ivorensis and Khaya anthotheca were well adjusted. However, the double-entry Spurr’s model was more accurate than the other models for both species. Furthermore, for the Khaya ivorensis , the one-entry (diameter) Husch’s model generated similar stem volume estimates to Spurr’s model.",2019-05-15,10.1007/s11056-018-9665-1,"['Santos, Felipe Martini', 'Terra, Gilberto', 'Chaer, Guilherme Montandon', 'Monte, Marco Antonio']",New Forests,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11056-018-9665-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer

The purpose of the study is to analyze the sources of funding available for such companies and to identify the areas for further development and effective use of green investment resources to ensure the investment attractiveness of companies in the context of sustainable development. Various instruments of state support and financial mechanisms for implementing budget financing used by European states to reduce the risks of investors are considered. The behavioral analysis of the subjects of the financial and trading sector and participants in the derivatives market trading has revealed the investors’ increased attention to green stocks and bonds, which is confirmed by the positive dynamics of the demand for environmentally responsible investment. According to the results of the research, it was suggested that the need to integrate factors affecting the sustainability of the green economy should be taken into account since it is impossible to separately develop its individual elements or individual financial instruments.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-00102-5_106,"['Shalneva, Maria S.', 'Zinchenko, Yuliya V.']",The Future of the Global Financial System: Downfall or Harmony,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-00102-5_106,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1577,Public Regulatory Trends in Sustainable Real Estate,"In this chapter, we discuss the three main instruments which planning authorities can use to influence the uptake of sustainable development practices: forward planning, development controls and development incentives. The potential of mandatory disclosure and integrated reporting to mainstream sustainability as a decision criterion is explored, with international examples offering guidance on how the public sector can guide industry in the adoption and implementation of sustainable practices. Finally, this chapter assesses the role of public-sector sustainable procurement practices in stimulating the green economy. It proposes three recommendations to improve the efficacy of public policy to increase the uptake of sustainable development practice across both public and private sectors. A common thread in these recommendations is the need for a collaborative approach creating stakeholder buy in and a need to resource the application of the UN Sustainable Development Goals at all levels of planning policy.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-94565-1_4,"['Christensen, Pernille H.', 'Gabe, Jeremy']",Sustainable Real Estate,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-94565-1_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1578,Decision support method for GHG emission management in industries,"Keeping temperature rise well below 2 °C is Paris Climate Agreement’s main commitment and corporate-level participation will be crucial to achieve national mitigation targets. Hence, companies should adopt measures that allow them to adapt to upcoming scenarios where low-carbon production is expected to become mandatory and a great competitive advantage. However, mitigation strategies cannot be evaluated without consideration of subjective environmental criteria. Consequently, lack of decision support methodologies for climate change evaluation in industries is a barrier for innovation. Aiming at consideration of non-monetary aspects, we develop a support method that incorporates costs, benefits, opportunities and risks related to climate change in manufacturing industries. First, we compared the most relevant multi-criteria decision analysis methodologies and identified an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as the most suitable for ranking corporate climate change strategies. Then, we collected global analysis criteria from the most important socially responsible investment indices, and climate change scientific studies. To adapt these criteria to the AHP method, each criterion was sorted into benefits, opportunities, costs or risks hierarchies. Proposed method was efficient for assessing long-term subjective criteria and ranking alternatives for GHG emission management in two large manufacturing companies. A sensitivity analysis of the outcome revealed its consistency and flexibility for ranking alternatives and weighting criteria. Finally, the method is not limited to a particular type of industry and it can be adapted to other areas, such as service companies, sanitation or public sector.",2018-06-01,10.1007/s13762-017-1505-x,"['Mistage, O.', 'Bilotta, P.']",International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13762-017-1505-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1579,Social Implications of Carbon Credit Trading—A Case Study,Carbon credits’ trading is an emerging concept from which several organizations start earning financial and social status. The Climate change is the greatest challenge threatening the survival of humanity itself because of its malpractice and release of toxic gases resulting in pollution of ecological endowments caused by human behavior in pursuit of economic motives. This research paper will examine the conditions leading to the climate change and the issues which are directly or indirectly related to the carbon credits trading and its relevance in society. The basic concept of Carbon Credits Trading is generated from Kyoto Protocol and is basically used to control the greenhouse gas emissions. This research paper will be based on a case study on a training session conducted by a reputed university and it will show the calculation of carbon credits trading relevant for economic and social growth.,2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-58589-5_10,"['Arya, Satyendra', 'Garg, Ajay K.', 'Mudgal, Rakesh K.']","Emerging Challenges in Business, Optimization, Technology, and Industry",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-58589-5_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer

1583,Who Owns Soil Carbon in Communal Lands? An Assessment of a Unique Property Right in Kenya,"This paper considers soil carbon property rights as they relate to community land tenure. This discussion is critical for Kenya and many other African States, which are taking steps towards establishing climate-change-related laws and policies. The paper also observes the special place of Kenya, being the first African State to enact a statute dedicated to climate change (Climate change Act, 2016, Laws of Kenya). As far as considerations of soil carbon are concerned, Kenya’s initiative on manure-based projects, (Ringius, UNEP Collaborating Centre on Energy and Environment (UCCEE) (1999) Soil carbon sequestration and the CDM Opportunities and challenges for Africa, p. 4.) and having been the first to obtain carbon credits issued under sustainable agricultural land-use management (SALM), has a unique position to lead the way in exploring the important issue of how to expose and clarify the law in order to maximise the potential for soil carbon sequestration. Importantly, the discussion herein echoes the concerns of other countries that are also grappling with the issue of how to assign which rights to carbon, generally in the course of engaging in climate change mitigation activities. This paper further considers the special case of communal land rights, as a factor that will inevitably affect the assignment of rights and distribution of any carbon-related benefits for the reason that this kind of tenure is the most predominant, not just in Kenya but in Africa.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-68885-5_17,"['Kamunde-Aquino, Nelly']",International Yearbook of Soil Law and Policy 2017,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-68885-5_17,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1584,Evolution of Climate Resilience and Low-Carbon Smart City Planning: A Process,"This chapter presents the global impacts of urbanization on urban ecosystems and their services, planning responses to climate change, and case studies and examines the emergence of climate resilient and low-carbon smart urbanism. Climate as one of the ecosystem services also is impacted by urbanization. The planet is very sensitive to climate change, and exposure to climate-driven natural disasters will increase. In a context where by 2050, almost 70% of the total world population will be living in towns and cities, and the climate resilience planning will become increasingly critical. Based on the selected case studies, energy conservation, low-carbon green city design, and impact assessments of urbanization on environment and climate change were found to be complementary tools for climate resilience planning. The emergence of a smart climate approach bringing together (1) eco-city, (2) sustainable city, and (3) conventional low-carbon green city approaches into the climate resilient and low-carbon smart city development will generate a much higher value added at lower cost.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-59618-1_1,"['Kim, Kwi-Gon']",Low-Carbon Smart Cities,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-59618-1_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1585,Building Carbon Literacy: How the Irish Press Normalise Public Discussion About Climate Mitigation Actions,"The aim of this paper is to extend current research on climate change communication by zoning in on communication about societal responses to climate change or Low Carbon Transition (LCT). Specifically, it contributes to thinking about communication strategies to foster public discussion about reducing carbon emissions. To do so, the research examines how news media represent LCT and thus act as resources for public talk about tackling climate change. This paper argues news media representations of LCT offer essential insights about the range of processes for LCT that are being made publically available and are therefore highly significant in terms of building carbon literacy and broadening public talk about carbon reduction activity. In particular, it highlights why communications strategies for building climate ‘smart’ publics in response to COP21 must consider the implications of how news media normalise LCT as a social issue. Drawing on an Irish case study, this research presents a novel method for analysing press representations of LCT and shows that press treatment constrains carbon literacy by deploying a limited range of topics. The paper concludes by offering insights for communication strategies aimed at building carbon literacy: it highlights that fostering public discussion about LCT can broaden public engagement with climate change.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-70479-1_17,"['McNally, Brenda']",Handbook of Climate Change Communication: Vol. 3,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-70479-1_17,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1586,Enlightenment and Power,"Focused, as it is, on energy—which is both the single largest cause of global warming and the largest industrial sector of the global economy—this chapter confronts a monolith of unenlightenment in order to demonstrate that an enlightened politics based on local democratic self-rule not only is necessary to transform energy but has also proven viable by successful grassroots efforts in some of America’s more decadent political milieus. From the Cold War up to this day, the left in Europe and the United States has engaged in a dialectical critique of the failures of the enlightenment. Flipping this negative critique of enlightenment on its head, and declaring the futility of resistance theory, this chapter posits a positive dialectic that situates local politics in opposition to the global politics of providential imperialists and postmodern resisters alike. What emerges is a viable example of localized intellectual intervention in the public realm that reinvigorates republican self-governance and reclaims democracy at the municipal level as the proper arena for enlightenment.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-70784-6_3,"['Fenn, Paul Douglas']",Enlightenment in an Age of Destruction,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-70784-6_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1587,Socialist hydropower governances compared: dams and resettlement as experienced by Dai and Thai societies from the Sino-Vietnamese borderlands,"Research on hydropower development has shown that a diversity of social and environmental impacts of dams is distributed unevenly among various state and corporate actors and riparian populations. This article analyses how two neighbouring socialist states, China and Vietnam, govern dam-induced resettlement along their respective sections of the Red River Watershed. Our investigation focuses on resettlement villages created during the construction of the Madushan (China) and Ban Chat (Vietnam) reservoirs and testifies that resettlement policies on both sides of the border serve statist modernization agendas that fail to acknowledge Dai (China) and Thai (Vietnam) ethnic minority livelihoods. While local populations endure the greatest impacts from dam-induced changes in water allocation and the ensuing consequences for land resources, the benefits of hydropower development are first and foremost shared among state-owned and/or state-backed energy companies. These companies reap huge profits from their role as power generators for capitalist production, while also benefiting from state authorities underevaluating resettled communities’ livelihood assets. A comparison of the two cases reveals that despite the border that separates China and Vietnam, and despite both states emphasizing different resettlement discourses, governance of dam-induced resettlement is strikingly similar.",2017-12-01,10.1007/s10113-017-1170-0,"['Rousseau, Jean-François', 'Orange, Didier', 'Habich-Sobiegalla, Sabrina', 'Van Thiet, Nguyen']",Regional Environmental Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10113-017-1170-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer

However, it is very hard to get quantitative evidence validating carbon stock difference among project area (PA), leakage management area and leakage belt (LB) at this moment. Accordingly, this study is intended to contrast OCO-2 XCO_2 signature between REDD+ project area and nearby LB. The XCO_2 in individual land cover have kept decreasing after the implementation of REDD+ project. The natural forest and woodland which is dominant land use and land cover type shows positive evidences achieved by the REDD project by presenting the lowest XCO_2 signature (natural forest: 394.1 ppm, woodland: 393.2 ppm) and highest NDVI (natural forest: 0.498, woodland: 0.488) in PA.

1589,The Impact of Climate Change on Regional Government Expenditures: Evidence from Russia,"This paper explores an almost untouched topic in the fast-growing climate econometrics literature—the implications of climate change for government expenditures. Using a rich sub-national dataset for Russia covering 1995–2009, we estimate the impacts of changes in climatic conditions through short-term variation and medium-term changes in average regional temperatures and precipitation. We show a strong and robust negative (but non-linear) relation between regional budget expenditures and population-weighted temperature. The results indicate that an increase in temperature results in a decrease in public expenditures and that the magnitude of this effect diminishes the warmer the region. Further, our results suggest that the benefits from warming accumulate and that adaptation measures could help leverage those benefits. The estimated decreases in regional government expenditure are, however, quite small. In mild warming scenarios, according to our estimates Russia saves roughly USD 3–4 billion in regional government expenditures between 2000 and the 2020s without undertaking adaptation measures, depending on the scenario. It should be noted that our results are estimated for a scenario of mild temperature increase (1–2  $$^{\circ }$$ ∘ C). Larger temperature increases are likely to have dramatic consequences e.g. from loss of permafrost and methane release that are impossible to predict with available historical data.",2017-05-01,10.1007/s10640-015-9977-y,"['Leppänen, Simo', 'Solanko, Laura', 'Kosonen, Riitta']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-015-9977-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1590,How supply chain coordination affects the environment: a carbon footprint perspective,"Environmental responsibility has become an important part of doing business. Government regulations and customers’ increased awareness of environmental issues are pushing supply chain entities to reduce the negative influence of their operations on the environment. In today’s world, companies must assume joint responsibility with their suppliers for the environmental impact of their actions. In this paper, we study coordination between a buyer and a vendor under the existence of two emission regulation policies: cap-and-trade and tax. We investigate the impact of decentralized and centralized replenishment decisions on total carbon emissions. The buyer in this system faces a deterministic and constant demand rate for a single product in the infinite horizon. The vendor produces at a finite rate and makes deliveries to the buyer on a lot-for-lot basis. Both the buyer and the vendor aim to minimize their average annual costs resulting from replenishment set-ups and inventory holding. We provide decentralized and centralized models for the buyer and the vendor to determine their ordering/production lot sizes under each policy. We compare the solutions due to independent and joint decision-making both analytically and numerically. Finally, we arrive at coordination mechanisms for this system to increase its profitability. However, we show that even though such coordination mechanisms help the buyer and the vendor decrease their costs without violating emission regulations, the cost minimizing solution may result in increased carbon emission under certain circumstances.",2017-03-01,10.1007/s10479-015-1858-9,"['Toptal, Ayşegül', 'Çetinkaya, Bilgesu']",Annals of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-015-1858-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1591,Mangrove and Freshwater Wetland Conservation Through Carbon Offsets: A Cost-Benefit Analysis for Establishing Environmental Policies,"Mexico has extensive coastal wetlands (4,243,137 ha), and one of its most important sites is the Alvarado Lagoon System, located in the Papaloapan River Basin on the Gulf of Mexico. The land cover dedicated to livestock and sugarcane has increased: by 25 % in 2005 and 50 % in 2010, with a loss of wetland vegetation and the carbon that it stores. We found that the Net Present Value of mangrove carbon offsets profit is equal to $5822.71, that of broad-leaved marshes is $7958.86, cattail marshes $5250.33, and forested wetlands $8369.41 per hectare, during a 30-year-carbonoffset contract. However, the opportunity cost from conserving wetland instead of growing sugarcane is positive according to REDD+ methodology, e.g., broad-leaved marsh conservation ranged from $6.73 to $20 USD/t CO2e, that of cattail marshes from $12.20 to $32.65 USD/t CO2e, and forested wetlands from $7.15 to $20.60 USD/t CO2e, whereas the opportunity cost between conservation and livestock was negative, it means that conservation is more profitable. The cost-benefit analysis for assessing investment projects from a governmental perspective is useful to determine the viability of conserving coastal wetlands through carbon offset credits. It also shows why in some areas it is not possible to conserve ecosystems due to the opportunity cost of changing from one economic activity (livestock and sugarcane) to carbon offsets for protecting wetlands. Furthermore, it allows for a comparison of carbon markets and assessment in terms of REDD+ and its methods for determining the social cost per ton of carbon avoided.",2017-02-01,10.1007/s00267-016-0790-3,"['Vázquez-González, César', 'Moreno-Casasola, Patricia', 'Hernández, María Elizabeth', 'Campos, Adolfo', 'Espejel, Ileana', 'Fermán-Almada, José Luis']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-016-0790-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer

1599,Assessing the consistency between AVHRR and MODIS NDVI datasets for estimating terrestrial net primary productivity over India,"This study examines the consistency between the AVHRR and MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets in estimating net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) over India during 2001–2006 in a terrestrial ecosystem model. Harmonic analysis is employed to estimate seasonal components of the time series. The stationary components (representing long-term mean) of the respective NDVI time series are highly coherent and exhibit inherent natural vegetation characteristics with high values over the forest, moderate over the cropland, and small over the grassland. Both data exhibit strong semi-annual oscillations over the cropland dominated Indo-Gangetic plains while annual oscillations are strong over most parts of the country. MODIS has larger annual amplitude than that of the AVHRR. The similar variability exists on the estimates of NPP and NEP across India. In an annual scale, MODIS-based NPP budget is 1.78 PgC, which is 27 % higher than the AVHRR- based estimate. It revealed that the Indian terrestrial ecosystem remained the sink of atmospheric CO _2 during the study period with 42 TgC y ^−1 NEP budget associated with MODIS-based estimate against 18 TgC y ^−1 for the AVHRR-based estimate.",2016-08-01,10.1007/s12040-016-0723-9,"['Nayak, R K', 'Mishra, N', 'Dadhwal, V K', 'Patel, N R', 'Salim, M', 'Rao, K H', 'S Dutt, C B']",Journal of Earth System Science,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12040-016-0723-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1600,Opportunities and challenges for mangrove carbon sequestration in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam,"Increasing value is attributed to mangroves due to their considerable capacity to sequester carbon, known as ‘blue carbon’. Assessments of opportunities and challenges associated with estimating the significance of carbon sequestered by mangroves need to consider a range of disciplinary perspectives, including the bio-physical science mangroves, social and economic issues of land use, local and international law, and the role of public and private finance. We undertook an interdisciplinary review based on available literature and fieldwork focused on parts of the Mekong River Delta (MRD). Preliminary estimates indicate mangrove biomass may be 70–150 t ha^−1, but considerably larger storage of carbon occurs in sediments beneath mangroves. These natural stores of carbon are compromised when mangroves are removed to accommodate anthropogenic activities. Mangroves are an important resource in the MRD that supplies multiple goods and services, and conservation or re-establishment of mangroves provides many benefits. International law and within-country environmental frameworks offer increasing scope to recognize the role that mangrove forests play through carbon sequestration, in order that these might lead to funding opportunities, both in public and private sectors. Such schemes need to have positive rather than negative impacts on the livelihoods of the many people living within and adjacent to these wetlands. Nevertheless, many challenges remain and it will require further targeted and coordinated scientific research, development of economic and social incentives to protect and restore mangroves, supportive law and policy mechanisms at global and national levels, and establishment of long-term financing for such endeavours.",2016-07-01,10.1007/s11625-016-0359-3,"['Warner, Robin', 'Kaidonis, Mary', 'Dun, Olivia', 'Rogers, Kerrylee', 'Shi, Yubing', 'Nguyen, Thang T.

1601,"Long-term improvement of agricultural vegetation by floodwater spreading in the Gareh Bygone Plain, Iran. In the pursuit of human security, is artificial recharge of groundwater more lucrative than selling oil?","Dans la plaine de Gareh Bygone dans le sud de l’Iran, les systèmes de drainage des eaux souterraines dans quatre communautés agricoles ont été asséchés par le pompage excessif dans des puits creusés illégalement dans toute la région. Des situations d’urgence ont pris place, entraînant une migration des populations vers les villes. Depuis 1983, 193 millions de m^3 d’eau ont été fournies à ces communautés par épandage des eaux de crues afin de faciliter l’irrigation de terrains sableux (2,034 ha) et la recharge artificielle des eaux souterraines; 76 % de ce volume ont contribué à la recharge de l’aquifère. Cela a conduite à une inversion de la migration de la population. La surface irriguée au cours de la saison des cultures 2010–2011 a été multipliée par 13.2 par comparaison à la période pré-épandage des eaux de crues, et l’équivalent d’une année de fourrage pour environ 700 moutons a été fournie depuis 1991. La recharge artificielle des eaux souterraines est une alternative logique à la construction de grands barrages en Iran; 420,000 km^2 d’alluvions grossières permettent une capacité de stockage de 5,000 km^3 d’eau, ce qui représente plus de dix fois les précipitations annuelles de l’ensemble du pays. Le coût équivalent pour la construction de barrages pour un tel volume étant estimé à US$12.5 × 10^12, la valorisation potentielle des alluvions peut apparaître réalisable. La recharge artificielle des eaux souterraines sur les surfaces de recharge des 33,000 systèmes de drainage des eaux souterraines par tunnel (qanats) desséchés pourrait contribuer à les réactiver. Comme les produits issus de l’agriculture absorbent 19 % de la valeur monétaire des imports iraniens, et que les activités de recharge artificielle des eaux souterraines pourraient fournir de l’eau pour la production agricole, les alluvions apparaissent comme étant plus précieuse que le pétrole, qui fournit la valeur du change. Plus important encore, la recharge artificielle des eaux souterraines sur 140,000 km^2 d’alluvions pourrait renforcer la capacité d’adaptation à la sécheresse et réduire le nombre et l’impact des situations d’urgence associées à l’eau. En la llanura sureña de Gareh Bygone en Irán, los qanats de abastecimiento de agua a cuatro comunidades agrícolas mixtas fueron desecados por sobrebombeo de pozos ilegales excavados en toda la zona. Se desarrollaron situaciones de emergencia, que resultaron en la migración hacia las ciudades. Desde 1983, 193 millones de m^3 de agua han sido suministrados a dichas comunidades por la difusión del agua de inundación (FWS) para facilitar el riego por inundación de las áreas arenosas (2,034 ha) y la recarga artificial del agua subterránea (ARG), de los cuales el 76 % ha recargado el acuífero. Esto dio lugar a una migración inversa de la población. La superficie de riego en la estación de crecimiento 2010–2011 se incrementó 13.2 veces en comparación con el período pre-FWS, y las plantas forrajeras anuales proporcionaron para alrededor de 700 ovejas desde 1991. El ARG es una alternativa lógica a la construcción de grandes represas en Irán; 420,000 km^2 de aluvión de grano grueso proporciona la capacidad para almacenar 5,000 km^3 de agua, lo que representa más de diez veces la precipitación anual de todo el país. Puesto que el costo equivalente para la construcción de presas para albergar a ese volumen se estima en US$12.5 × 10^12, el valor potencial de los aluviones debe ser tenido en cuenta. El ARG en las zonas de recarga de 33,000 de los qanats desecados eventualmente podría rejuvenecerlos a ellos. Como los productos agrícolas absorben el 19 % del valor monetario de las importaciones de Irán, y las actividades ARG podrían suministrar el agua para producirlos, los aluviones son aún más valiosos que el petróleo, para proporcionar divisas. Más importante aún, los ARG sobre 140,000 km^2 del aluvión podrían fortalecer la capacidad para adaptarse a las sequías y reducir el número y el impacto de las situaciones de emergencia relacionadas con el agua. No sul da planície Gareh Bygone no Irã, quatro qanats de abastecimento de água de comunidades com agricultura diversificada foram dessecados por excesso de bombeamento de poços cavados de forma ilegal por toda a área. As situações de emergência desenvolvidas resultaram em migrações para a cidade. Desde 1983, 193 milhões de m^3 de água foram fornecidos a essas comunidades por água de inundação (AI), a fim de facilitar a irrigação por inundação em pastagens arenosas (2,034 ha) e a recarga artificial (RA) das águas subterrâneas, das quais 76 % recarregam o aquífero. Isto resultou em uma migração inversa da população. A área irrigada na safra (2010–2011) aumentou em 13.2 vezes quando comparada com o período pré-AI, e a forragem anual de cerca de 700 ovelhas tem sido fornecida desde 1991. A RA das águas subterrâneas é uma alternativa lógica para a construção de grandes barragens no Irã; 420,000 km^2 de aluvião de granulação grossa apresentam capacidade para armazenar 5,000 km^3 de água, o que representa mais de dez vezes a precipitação anual de todo o país. Como o custo equivalente para a construção de barragens para acomodar esse volume é estimado em US $ 12.5 × 10^12, o valor potencial do aluvião pode ser considerado. A RA das águas subterrâneas nas áreas de recarga de 33,000 dos qanats dessecados poderia, eventualmente, rejuvenescê-los. Como as commodities agrícolas absorvem 19 % do valor monetário das importações do Irã, e as atividades de RA das águas subterrâneas poderiam proporcionar água para produzi-las, o aluvião é ainda mais valioso do que o petróleo, que gera câmbio externo. Mais importante, a RA das águas subterrâneas em 140,000 km^2 de aluvião poderia reforçar a capacidade de adaptação às secas e reduzir o número e impacto das situações de emergência relacionadas a água. In southern Iran’s Gareh Bygone Plain, water-supply qanats in four mixed farming communities were desiccated by over-pumping of illegal dug wells throughout the area. Emergency situations developed, resulting in city-ward migration. Since 1983, 193 million m^3 of water has been supplied to those communities by floodwater spreading (FWS) to facilitate spate irrigation of sandy rangeland (2,034 ha) and artificial recharge of groundwater (ARG), of which 76 % has recharged the aquifer. This resulted in a reverse migration of the population. The irrigated area in the 2010–2011 growing season increased 13.2 fold when compared to the pre-FWS period, and year-round forage for about 700 sheep has been provided since 1991. The ARG is a logical alternative to building large dams in Iran; 420,000 km^2 of coarse-grained alluvium provides capacity to store 5,000 km^3 of water, representing more than ten times the annual precipitation of the whole country. As the equivalent cost for building dams to accommodate that volume is estimated at US$12.5 × 10^12, the potential value of the alluvium may be realized. ARG on the recharge areas of 33,000 of the desiccated qanats eventually could rejuvenate them. As agricultural commodities absorb 19 % of the monetary value of Iran’s imports, and ARG activities could supply the water to produce them, alluvium is even more valuable than oil, which provides foreign exchange. More importantly, ARG on 140,000 km^2 of the alluvium could strengthen the capacity to adapt to droughts and reduce the number and impact of water-related emergency situations. پيامد آبكشي بي‌رويه از چاههاي غير مجاز، خشكيدن كاريزهايي بود كه آب چهار روستا را در دشت گربايگان در جنوب ايران تامين مي‌كردند. اين نابخردي سبب بحراني شدن شرايط زيست و مهاجرت گروهي روستاييان به شهرها شد. بناي 2034 هكتار شبكه‌هاي گسترش سيلاب براي آبياري سيلابي و تغذيه‌ي مصنوعي آبخوانها از دي1361 تا 1375، سبب مهار شدن 193 ميليون مترمكعب سيلاب و نفوذ 76 در صد آن به آبخوان شد. نتيجه اين كار ايجاد انگيزه‌ي بازگشت در بيشتر مهاجران به روستاهايشان بود. در نتيجه اجراي اين طرح در سال زراعي 1390−1389، مساحت پهنه‌ي كشتزارهاي آبيانه 13.2 برابر سال 1361 شد. افزون بر آن، از سال 1369 تاكنون، سالانه براي 700 واحد دامي علوفه‌ي مغذي تهيه شده است. تغذيه‌ي مصنوعي آبخوانها گزينه‌اي بخردانه را در برابر ساختن سدهاي بزرگ پيشنهاد مي‌كند. 420 هزار كيلومتر مربع از پهنه‌ي ايران را آبرفتهاي درشت دانه‌ي ژرف پوشانده‌اند. گنجايش اين آبخوانهاي 5000 كيلومتر مكعب، يعني 10 برابر بارندگي سالانه‌ي سراسر ايران است. اگر هزينه‌ي فراهم ساختن يك متر مكعب گنجايش در سراب سدهاي بزرگ 2.5 دلار آمريكاي منظور گردد، ارزش بالقوه‌ي اين فضاي تهي 10^12 ×12.5لار است. افزون بر آن، گسترش سيلاب بر فراز آبخوانهاي 33000 رشته كاريز خشكيده، سبب به راه افتادن دو باره‌ي آنها خواهد شد. 19 درصد ارزش واردات ايران در سال 1392 مربوط به مواد غذايي است كه در صورت در دسترس بودن آب مي‌توان بخشي از آن را در كشور توليد كرد. از آن جا كه تغذيه‌ي مصنوعي آبخوانها آب مورد نياز را فراهم مي‌آورد، ارزش آبرفتها بيش از نفتي است كه از فروش آن ارز لازم براي خريدن مواد غذايي به دست مي‌آيد. تغذيه‌ي مصنوعي آبخوانها در پهنه‌ي 140000 كيلومتر مربع، توان ايران را براي مقابله با خشكسالي و كاهش بحرانهاي مربوطه مي‌افزايد. 在伊朗南部的Gareh Bygone平原,由于从非法挖掘的井中过量抽水,致使四个混合的农业社区供水坎井被疏干。紧急状况持续发展,导致人口向城市方向迁移。自从1983年,通过洪水蔓延向这些社区供水1.93亿方水,促进了砂质牧场(2034公顷)的漫灌和地下水人工补给,其中76%补给了含水层。这导致了人口的逆向迁移。2010–2011年生长季节灌溉面积与洪水蔓延前相比增加了13.2倍,自从1991年提供了大约700只羊一年的饲料。地下水补给是伊朗建设大型水坝合理选择;42万平方千米的粗颗粒冲积层提供了5000立方千米的储存能力,是全国年降水量的10倍多。建设储存如此水量 的大坝所花的开支估计为12.5 × 10^12美元,因此,就可实现冲积层的潜在价值。对33000个干燥的坎儿井的补给区,地下水人工补给最终能恢复他们。农产品承担19%的伊朗进口的货币价值,地下水人工补给活动能产生他们供给水,冲积层甚至比石油更珍贵,在于它提供外汇。更重要的是,地下水人工补给对140000平方公里的冲积层可以加强能力适应干旱和减少与水有关的紧急情况的影响。",2016-03-01,10.1007/s10040-015-1354-y,"['Mesbah, Sayyed Hamid', 'Mohammadnia, Mehrdad', 'Kowsar, Sayyed Ahang']",Hydrogeology Journal,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10040-015-1354-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1602,Energy Decision-Making 1: Strategic Planning of Sustainable Manufacturing Projects Based on Stochastic Programming,"The need of energy decision making happens in realizing sustainable manufacturing. Many companies in the manufacturing industry have realized the importance of sustainability and have made a strategic move toward sustainable manufacturing to face the uncertainty of future energy availability and stringent environment regulations enacted around the world. However, it is a challenge to build a strategic plan for implementing sustainable manufacturing projects in such a way as to optimize energy efficiency opportunities while remaining in compliance with environmental regulations especially when future uncertainties, such as a fluctuation in energy prices or CO_2 credit costs, are involved. This chapter proposes a new stochastic programming approach to identify the optimal investment plan for sustainable manufacturing projects to reduce energy and CO_2 emission costs for manufacturing processes subject to various time, budget, technology and environmental constraints. The principle underlying the proposed approach is to solve a multi-period stochastic programming involving uncertain decision parameters, such as future CO_2 credit market price, through the use of sample averaging approximation (SAA). An illustrative example application of the proposed model to an automotive company is presented. In Appendix, this chapter also provides an overview of the available standards and methods that can be used for preparing Scope 3 green house gas inventories and carbon footprints for organizations and their specific products or services.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-32729-7_3,"['Oh, Seog-Chan', 'Hildreth, Alfred J.']",Analytics for Smart Energy Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-32729-7_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer

1604,Real Option Approach on Infrastructure Investment in Vietnam: Focused on Smart City Project,"The electricity shortage, the natural disasters and the emission of greenhouse gasses have been challenges that Vietnam has to confront to sustain high economic growth in the long-term. We are moving forward to “Smart City” project in Japan that brings a better life for citizens through public services, utilization of resources and less impact on environment. However, this project requires huge investment of financial amounts and long term to profitability under uncertainties. Therefore, real options analysis is used as a theoretical framework to better account for the technological and market uncertainties and irreversibility that impact the investment and innovation decisions of firms. This paper shows how to use the quadranomial approach for two sources of uncertainty and with compound rainbow options. The specific one is if the investors decide to invest in R&D of the project, they will get the different carbon credit values created from this project changing at the same volatility of project’s products in each investing node through Clean Development Mechanism.

1605,Carbon Crime in the Voluntary Market: An Exploration of Modernization Themes Among a Sample of Criminal and Non-criminal Organizations,"The international voluntary carbon market allows economic actors to profit financially by selling carbon reduction projects (as carbon credits) in the marketplace. The objective of this work is to examine the ideology of that market and its implications for crime and climate change. More specifically, we compare advertising messages for two sets of actors in the voluntary carbon market: criminal and non-criminal organizations. To carry out this analysis we draw upon a grounded theory approach to analyze marketing websites for a sample of organizations that sell credits. We discover that overall, organizations draw upon ecological modernization ideology to provide opportunities to gain access to investors and victims by emphasizing (1) sustainability; (2) ethical behaviour; (3) economic development; and, (4) technological innovation.

1606,Improving the robustness of biomass functions: from empirical to functional approaches,"Key message We developed precise, consistent, generic, and robust biomass equations for seven aboveground tree components of sessile and pedunculate oaks. These equations can be used to accurately estimate carbon stocks and fluxes in and out of the forest. Context Large uncertainties still persist when using existing biomass equations for larger scale applications. Aims The objective of this study was to test two contrasting modeling approaches to obtain biomass estimates of various components (stem, stem wood, stem bark, crown, and three branch categories) for Quercus petraea and Quercus robur and to compare them in terms of predictive capacity, genericity, consistency, and robustness. Methods All models were calibrated on a total of 117 oak trees sampled over a wide range of sites and stands and further tested on an independent data set of 33 trees. The “empirical” approach consisted in declining a common allometric equation based on two variables (diameter at breast height and total height) into all its possible forms and selecting the final model on purely statistical performances; the “structural” method was based on the fitting of a priori dedicated model forms for each component to allow a clear interpretation of the model parameters. Results For the stem components, both approaches resulted in similar statistical performances despite difference in model forms and number of parameters. Although equally performant on the validation data set for the total crown, only the structural model gave satisfactory results when applied to the independent data set. Both approaches failed to accurately predict the branch fractions on the validation data set. Conclusion Using physically based model forms increased the robustness of the biomass equations.",2015-09-01,10.1007/s13595-014-0423-z,"['Hounzandji, Ablo Paul Igor', 'Jonard, Mathieu', 'Nys, Claude', 'Saint-André, Laurent', 'Ponette, Quentin']",Annals of Forest Science,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13595-014-0423-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1607,"Quantification and use of rice husk in decentralized electricity generation in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil","Rice husk (RH) use in electricity generation can help mitigate environmental issues and generate profits, specifically in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state, Brazil. The objectives of this study are to estimate the RH surplus in RS and evaluate the feasibility of its use in electricity generation. RH production in RS is estimated at 755 thousand tons per year, which is generated by 230 rice mills. Geographic Information System helped in showing RH’s power capacity for each municipality in RS. This large amount of residue has a potential output of 479.5 MW and 322.7 GWh per year. 43.1 % of this potential comes from 214 mills (93 % of total) whose power plants’ capacity is lower than 800 kW, thus classified as Micro Thermal Power Plants (MTPs). Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the lower the MTP capacity, the more sensitive it is to economic parameters. Furthermore, all MTPs evaluated only showed profitability when Certificates of Emissions Reduction were included, showing the importance of such income.

1608,Evaluation of Sustainability Practices in the United States and Large Corporations,"A survey-based research study was conducted to analyze sustainability practices of large U.S. corporations in their domestic and international operations. Large U.S. corporations were slow to address global environmental challenges, but a majority of them now demonstrate a clear understanding of their responsibilities. Most large U.S. corporations are proactively involved in sustainability and environmentally friendly measures, and their involvement at home is more intense than abroad. Analyses revealed that U.S. corporations engage in eight activities related to sustainability: investing in energy-efficient methods, generating electricity from solar power, generating electricity from wind power, using biofuels, trading carbon credits, supporting environmental organizations, generating electricity from biomass, and generating electricity from hydropower. Of these, only generating electricity from biomass and hydropower were not significantly different with respect to U.S. corporations’ foreign and domestic implementation. This paper represents the first attempt to determine whether and how U.S. corporations’ efforts to promote sustainability differ with respect to their operational locus (domestic or overseas).",2015-03-01,10.1007/s10551-014-2056-4,"['Hashmi, M.

1611,Business Models and Economic Approaches for Recovering Energy from Wastewater and Fecal Sludge,"Universal access to water, sanitation and energy services are key challenges in low income countries. The conventional model of providing water, sanitation and waste disposal as a social service is no longer viable because national authorities lack financial and human resources for operation and maintenance and for addressing the sanitation needs locally. Human excreta and wastewater represent resources that can be used to generate new income and support livelihoods through use as a source of energy. The reduction, removal and reuse of wastes must become financially feasible and economically profitable and yield high returns. This requires innovative and sustainable business models and financing instruments for their implementation. This chapter presents an overview of successful and emerging business cases for recovering energy and other useful products from wastewater and fecal sludge from low and middle income countries. The business cases are analysed for their business concepts and opportunities and challenges for scaling-up and scaling-out.

1612,"Carbon Trade, Forestry Land Rights, and Farmers’ Livelihood in Rural Communities in China","This chapter focuses on carbon trade, forestry land rights, and farmers’ livelihoods in rural Chinese communities. At present, China is establishing and developing a voluntary forest carbon sinks market, a process associated with forestry property transactions, as part of the domestic portfolio of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction activities through market-based mechanisms. With the land property right reforms in China, the use rights of forestland were assigned to households. While forestry carbon trading is suitable for large- or middle-scale forest farms, households with a small piece of forestland find it difficult to participate in this carbon trade. Thus, China’s government has combined the forest carbon trade policy and forest rights reform in order to realise the goal of climate change adoption, mitigation and poverty reduction. The implementation of these policies has had a great impact on rural communities in China. This chapter introduces the background and development process of China’s forest carbon trade, analyses the impacts of forest carbon trade and forestland rights exchange on local households, based on the case studies in Guangxi and Zhejiang province, and provides some policy suggestions on how to facilitate the carbon trade and gain more benefit for local rural communities.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-11319-7_4,"['Zhu, Ying', 'Lan, Hong', 'Ness, David A.', 'Xing, Ke', 'Schneider, Kris', 'Lee, Seung-Hee', 'Ge, Jing']",Transforming Rural Communities in China and Beyond,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-11319-7_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1613,Economic Benefit of Management Options for a Suburban Forest (Kho Hong Hill) in South Thailand,"Kho Hong Hill (KHH) is located close to Hat Yai City in Songkhla Province, South Thailand. Almost half of its forested area has been deforested as a consequence of population increase, urbanization and the ongoing conversion of forest areas into rubber plantations. This study assesses the net economic benefits of three forest resource management strategies based on information derived from interviews and discussions with relevant KHH stakeholders. The three strategies are represented as three scenarios: Scenario I is the base case or the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario; Scenario II involves the establishment of protected areas to preserve the remaining forest areas in KHH; and Scenario III assumes the implementation of forest restoration and rehabilitation initiatives designed to increase the forest areas on KHH. Six ecosystem services are selected as the environmental variables for the study: (a) the provision of timber, (b) carbon dioxide sequestration, (c) oxygen generation, (d) water supply, (e) flood control and (f) biodiversity. Market valuation is used to estimate the values of provision of timber, CO_2 sequestration, O_2 generation, water supply and flood control, while the value transfer approach is used to value of the service derived from KHH biodiversity. The results show that under Scenario I, the annual benefits from the ecosystem services from KHH would become negative after 15 years, whereas positive net present values would be yielded under Scenarios II and III. The study recommends that rubber farmers should be encouraged to convert their rubber plantations back to forest areas. Introducing a payment for ecosystem services (PES), mechanism is also recommended to induce rubber farmers to reforest. Further studies would be needed, however, to establish an effective PES system.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-981-287-393-4_13,"['Roongtawanreongsri, Saowalak', 'Sawangchote, Prakart', 'Bumrungsri, Sara', 'Suksaroj, Chaisri']",Cost-Benefit Studies of Natural Resource Management in Southeast Asia,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-287-393-4_13,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer

1615,DMSP-IEES: A Stochastic Programming Model Based on Dual-Interval and Multi-Stage Scenarios Modeling Approaches for Energy Systems Management and GHG Emissions Control,"Energy-related activities contribute a major portion of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere. In this study, a dual-interval multi-stage stochastic programming model for the planning of integrated energy-environment systems (DMSP-IEES) model is developed for integrated energy-environment systems management, in which issues of GHG-emission mitigation can be reflected throughout the process of energy systems planning. By integrating methodologies of interval linear programming (when numbers are described as interval values without distribution information), dual-interval programming (when lower and upper bounds of interval values are not available as deterministic values but as discrete intervals), and multi-stage stochastic programming, the DMSP-IEES model is capable of dealing with uncertainties expressed as discrete intervals, dual intervals, and probability distributions within a multi-stage context. Decision alternatives can also be generated through analysis of the single- and dual-interval solutions according to projected applicable conditions. A case study is provided for demonstrating the applicability of the developed methodology. The results indicate that the developed model can tackle the dual uncertainties and the dynamic complexities in the energy-environment management systems through a multi-layer scenario tree. In addition, it can reflect the interactions among multiple system components and the associated trade-offs.",2014-10-01,10.1007/s10666-014-9403-9,"['Li, G. C.', 'Huang, G. H.', 'Liu, Z.

1616,The Chronological Advancement of Soil Organic Carbon Sequestration Research: A Review,"According to Kyoto protocol carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystem is a low cost option to mitigate the increasing atmospheric CO_2 concentrations. It has been understood that the world’s forests and their soils have a high potential to sequester the atmospheric carbon. For the last two decades there has been increasing interest among scientists in terrestrial soil carbon storage processes. This review made an attempt to summarize the major chronological advancement of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration research and also to underpin the problems yet to be focused on this research at global level. SOC sequestration research began in the early seventies, where most of the studies were estimating the size/stock of the global SOC. In the early eighties, most of the researchers have started to focus on the factors involved in the storage of organic carbon in different ecosystems. Subsequently, the researchers started to work on different types of SOC pools, their size, turnover and chemical characterization in different types of ecosystems. Recently the researcher’s main focus has been the temperature sensitivity of organic carbon in different types of soil and their mechanism of stabilization. There has been interest among researchers on the contribution of microbial derived (microbial necromass) carbon in recalcitrant pool of SOC and their sequestration process in different types of ecosystems. Arguably, the contribution in SOC sequestration research on the fate of sequestered carbon in different types of soil and their stabilization mechanisms is insufficient. India is the country spread over regions from temperate to dry desert zones with different types of fragile ecosystems and its vulnerable nature to the global climate change. Therefore, the future research must focus on SOC sensitivity to temperature and SOC stabilization mechanisms in different ecosystems for better understanding of the soil carbon cycle.",2014-09-01,10.1007/s40011-014-0320-0,"['Dinakaran, J.', 'Hanief, Mohammad', 'Meena, Archana', 'Rao, K.

1617,Carbon stocks in semi-arid pastoral ecosystems of northern Kenya,"Data on carbon stocks in pastoral ecosystems is important for assessing their contribution for offsetting emissions of greenhouse gases through carbon storage. Such data also provides baseline information to determine if pastoral grazing management can be engaged for carbon credit trading. Real and accurate carbon data is scarce. Much of the available data is often based on limited assessment of carbon stocks in a specified range unit, which fails to capture the spatial and temporal heterogeneity that characterizes pastoral ecosystems. In this study, we considered heterogeneity of semi-arid pastoral ecosystems of northern Kenya by aggregating sample results taken during wet and dry seasons and from various landscape types. We found average carbon stocks of 93.01 ± 15.72 tonnes ha−1 across landscape types and seasons. The measured amount of stored carbon is sufficient to have an important contribution in controlling the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases; it also indicates a potential to improve pastoralist livelihoods through carbon credit trading. However, more research would be required in order to qualify pastoralists for carbon credits since the data collected in this study is not sufficient to determine the change in carbon storage by grazing practices. In addition, uncertainty in the value of carbon credits needs to be considered to avoid relying on a risky prospect.",2014-05-28,10.1186/2041-7136-4-5,"['Dabasso, Bulle Hallo', 'Taddese, Zerihun', 'Hoag, Dana']",Pastoralism,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/2041-7136-4-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1618,The Ethical Challenges of the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism,"This paper examines the ethical implications of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the United Nation’s climate change initiative that provides incentives to countries and firms in developed countries to motivate investments in greenhouse gas reduction projects in developing countries. Using the tenets of agency theory, we present a solid waste management project in El Salvador as an illustrative example of how the CDM can produce a disproportionately high social cost for the most marginalized populations in the developing world. We suggest that the UN needs to reformulate the CDM so that it more effectively aligns the divergent goals of multiple actors and upholds the UN’s principles for sustainable development, including ethical firm-level behavior. By providing incentives for environmental, economic, and social value creation, the CDM would not only promote ethical norms for profit-seeking firms that participate in the program but also reinforce the UN’s twin pro-poor and environmental objectives.",2013-11-01,10.1007/s10551-013-1720-4,"['Martinez, Candace A.', 'Bowen, J.

1621,Resource-Centered Cities and the Opportunity of Shrinkage,"Our planet is being anthroposized at high speed with Climate Change and other global environmental damages as its consequence. As home of most consumers, many are looking at cities for solutions. Urban densification is often seen as ‘the’ way towards more urban sustainability. However, externalities of urban consumption and the complexity of the urban system are mostly left out of consideration, leading to unexpected results. This chapter advocates a transition from consumption-centered to resource-centered cities. In an age of rapid urbanization, this chapter further argues how shrinking cities could unexpectedly function as catalysts for change.

1622,Seeing the trees for the carbon: agroforestry for development and carbon mitigation,"Land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities will play an important role in global climate change mitigation. Many carbon schemes require the delivery of both climate and rural development benefits by mitigation activities conducted in developing countries. Agroforestry is a LULUCF activity that is gaining attention because of its potential to deliver climate benefits as well as rural development benefits to smallholders. There is hope that agroforestry can deliver co-benefits for climate and development; however experience with early projects suggests co-benefits are difficult to achieve in practice. We review the literature on agroforestry, participatory rural development, tree-based carbon projects and co-benefit carbon projects to look at how recommended project characteristics align when trying to generate different types of benefits. We conclude that there is considerable tension inherent in designing co-benefit smallholder agroforestry projects. We suggest that designing projects to seek ancillary benefits rather than co-benefits may help to reduce this tension.",2012-12-01,10.1007/s10584-012-0456-y,"['Anderson, Emily K.', 'Zerriffi, Hisham']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-012-0456-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1623,The potential for carbon offset trading to provide added incentive to adopt silvopasture and alley cropping in Missouri,"Global carbon trading may present a unique opportunity to change the rural landscape by allowing landowners to make an environmental impact with financial incentives. By enticing point source polluters to trade to an optimal level of pollution by offsetting their emissions with compatible carbon reduction projects, markets are able to facilitate a cleaner environment. Agroforestry provides a set of practices that can sequester carbon with managed tree and crop plantings. However, the initial lack of financial resources has been an obstacle to its adoption in the United States. This paper explores the potential for carbon offset trading to provide an added incentive to adopt agroforestry practices. Chicago Climate Exchange carbon sequestration projects are used as a baseline assessment, and the requirements that Missouri landowners would need to do in terms of contracting and ownership are identified. Data from landowners in central Missouri and the Ozarks (353 individuals) are used to determine characteristics of potentially interested landowners in agroforestry. A model to evaluate agroforestry profitability scenarios is used to compare the added carbon credit trading revenue to traditional alternate uses for the property. The findings from this analysis indicate that in the current context carbon trading does not provide an added incentive value for Missouri landowners to adopt either silvopasture or alley cropping practices because of the low magnitude of annual return.",2012-11-01,10.1007/s10457-012-9543-3,"['Holderieath, Jason', 'Valdivia, Corinne', 'Godsey, Larry', 'Barbieri, Carla']",Agroforestry Systems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10457-012-9543-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1624,"Resolving the Conflict Between Ecosystem Protection and Land Use in Protected Areas of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, Mexico","Livelihoods of people living in many protected areas (PAs) around the world are in conflict with biodiversity conservation. In Mexico, the decrees of creation of biosphere reserves state that rural communities with the right to use buffer zones must avoid deforestation and their land uses must become sustainable, a task which is not easily accomplished. The objectives of this paper are: (a) to analyze the conflict between people’s livelihoods and ecosystem protection in the PAs of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas (SMC), paying special attention to the rates and causes of deforestation and (b) to review policy options to ensure forest and ecosystem conservation in these PAs, including the existing payments for environmental services system and improvements thereof as well as options for sustainable land management. We found that the three largest PAs in the SMC are still largely forested, and deforestation rates have decreased since 2000. Cases of forest conversion are located in specific zones and are related to agrarian and political conflicts as well as growing economic inequality and population numbers. These problems could cause an increase in forest loss in the near future. Payments for environmental services and access to carbon markets are identified as options to ensure forest permanence but still face problems. Challenges for the future are to integrate these incentive mechanisms with sustainable land management and a stronger involvement of land holders in conservation.",2012-03-01,10.1007/s00267-011-9799-9,"['Cortina-Villar, Sergio', 'Plascencia-Vargas, Héctor', 'Vaca, Raúl', 'Schroth, Götz', 'Zepeda, Yatziri', 'Soto-Pinto, Lorena', 'Nahed-Toral, José']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-011-9799-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer

1626,Financing of Biofuel Projects in Africa,"The development of biofuel ventures offers significant opportunities for Africa to improve the low yield subsistence farming-dominated agricultural sector, mostly with regards to energy, environmental and socio-economic aspects. Taking into account a number of specific characteristics (i.e. reliance on feedstock, food versus fuel debate, strong dependence on related policy frameworks and high risk profiles), barriers related to policies, financing, trade, and other non-technical issues are particularly relevant to the development of biofuel ventures in Africa. Strategies to overcome these barriers include measures such as the removal of regulatory risk through government policy support, creation of financial incentives for biofuels, access to financing, improved trading regulations and infrastructure and the development of related markets. Financing options for biofuel ventures are influenced by the mode of service of the venture. Project-based fuel supply businesses generally require project-based finance options whereas energy service company (ESCO) approaches can attract a wider range of finance options and access carbon finance or green certificate revenue by virtue of scale opportunities.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-2181-4_29,"['Hofmann, Michael', 'Morris, Glynn', 'Ballard-Tremeer, Grant', 'Khatun, Kaysara']",Bioenergy for Sustainable Development in Africa,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-2181-4_29,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1627,Impacts of Biofuel Expansion in Biodiversity Hotspots,"The finitude of fossil fuels, concerns for energy security, and the need to respond to climate change has led to growing worldwide interests in biofuels. However, a significant proportion of conventional biofuel feedstocks is produced in the tropics, notably oil palm in Southeast Asia, and soy and sugarcane in Brazil. This is a worrying trend for many tropical biologists, because it is also within the tropics where the majority of the world’s biodiversity hotspots are located (Myers et al. 2000). For at least the next decade, first generation biofuels will still be in demand. In biodiversity hotspots, where a myriad of anthropogenic factors are already driving intense land use conflicts, biofuel production will pose an additional challenge to the preservation of the remaining natural habitats. Here we address the following questions: How does biofuel expansion threaten biodiversity hotspots? How can we reconcile biofuel expansion with biodiversity conservation in these hotspots?",2011-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-20992-5_15,"['Lee, Janice S.

1628,Options on Land Management and Land Use for Coping with Climate Change in South Asia,"The South Asia region is characterized by high population density and scarcely available land for sustainable agriculture. The region has a land area of 642 million ha (Mha) and a population of 1,587 million. The agricultural population is 786 million, 49% of the total. The area of agricultural land is 230 Mha, 36% of the total land area. The average ratio of agricultural land to agricultural population in the region is 0.33 ha per caput. Food security situation in South Asia is further affected by low productivity and prone to natural disaster. Causes of these problems are high population pressure, urbanization, increased demand for bio-fuels, building materials, and agricultural lands. The diversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural uses is also a growing concern. Fertile farm lands are being indiscriminately diverted, thus reducing the area available for food production. Vulnerability to food security is rising because of climate change which makes more areas, particularly coastal and low-lying areas, disaster-prone while growing population is further forcing vulnerable people to settle in risk-prone areas and crop land inundated. The problem is aggravated by factors such as skewed distribution of assets and income, degradation of the natural resource base and unsustainable management of land and water resources. Smallholder and subsistence farmers may not be able to cope with climate change effectively, due to reduced adaptive capacity and higher climate vulnerability. Under such conditions, pressure to cultivate marginal land or to adopt unsustainable cultivation practices as yields drop is likely, and may increase land degradation, water scarcity and endanger biodiversity. To cope with climate change and increase agricultural productivity through conservation and efficient use of agricultural land and water resources with technical, policy support and environmental considerations, improved land management and land-use planning are possible adaptation methods. Those risks could be reduced through resource conservation technologies, providing information and education, and through suitable policy measures. There is a need to balance food security needs with sustainable use of land and water. Diversifying from high water consuming crops to high value horticulture and livestock products is preferable and growing. Monitoring of climate change may also mitigate the serious implications for the South Asia’s agriculture. For the mitigation to climate change by controlling GHG emissions in agriculture, a variety of options exist. The most prominent options are improved crop and grazing land management, restoration of organic soils, and restoration of degraded lands. In less extent, but still significant mitigation is possible with improved water and rice management, agroforestry, and improved livestock and manure management. Sustainable use and management of soil and water resources in South Asia is a major issue to be addressed through adaptations of technologies such as low tillage and maintenance of permanent soil cover that can increase SOM and reduce impacts from flooding, erosion, drought, heavy rain and winds. Also the potential areas being explored are conservation agriculture, organic agriculture and risk-coping production systems that incorporate crop rotations, agroforestry, crop–livestock associations, crop–fish systems and the use of hedges, vegetative buffer strips and other farm landscaping practices. Surface mulch cover protects soil from excess temperatures and evaporation losses and can reduce crop water requirements by 30%.",2011-01-01,10.1007/978-90-481-9516-9_17,"['Niino, Yuji']",Climate Change and Food Security in South Asia,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-90-481-9516-9_17,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1629,Connecting Carbon Capture with Oceanic Biomass Production,"The climate change believed by anthropogenic emission is not isolated but tightly coupled with other issues including biodiversity loss and ocean acidification etc., and in order to prevent the potential serious impacts, both political and technological methods are being tried for greenhouse mitigation. Dimming the income sunlight by some “geoengineering” approaches currently seem ruinously expensive and technically difficult, and would not prevent the increase of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in atmosphere and ocean acidification, so capturing carbon to reduce the environmental concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and promoting renewable energy development for the reduction of using fossil fuels are very necessary. Biofuels derived from natural and agricultural biomass could be deployed for power production and existing transportation needs. The current economics are more favorable for conversion of edible biomass into biofuels, which could spend plenty of freshwater and farmlands, compete with food supply, and create a “carbon debt” with local ecosystem destruction by deforestation to expand biofuel-crop production. So it is vital to develop processes for converting non-edible feedstock such as lignocellulose and microalgae into biofuels.Compared with lignocellulose, microalgae have higher growth rates, don’t need plenteous freshwater for irrigating, and can grow in the conditions that are not favorable for terrestrial biomass growth. The current limitation of microalgal biofuels is the microalgae cultivation cost, and to compensate the high cost of microalgal biofuels, three suggestions are propounded here. (i) Using ships as the platforms of cultivating microalgae, producing biofuels, and transporting feedstock and products on a large scale on subtropical oligotrophic oceans, where the ocean’s least productive waters are formed with compared peaceful surface condition and poor marine communities. (ii) Operating different kinds of oceanic biomass productions for high-value products to compensate the cost of microalgal biofuels. Different kinds of microalgae and macroalgae (seaweeds) could be cultivated for biofuels, chemicals, healthy food, and feed for breeding economic marine species to satisfy the accelerating demands for seafood supply and simultaneously mitigate the fast decline of wild stocks. (iii) Constituting financial subsidies to make CO2 as the feedstock of microalgae cultivation for free, and exact quantifying the carbon captured in biomass products and the CO2 reduction that these products would provide by displacing natural and nonrenewable carbon resources, to take part in the international carbon-credit trading markets and sell the offsets. In a word, this article mainly talks about trying to find a way that connect CO2 capture with renewable energy development, and partially combat against deforestation, loss of biodiversity, shortage of food, and decline of marine lives etc., if possible.",2010-11-08,10.1038/npre.2010.5161.1,"['Wang, Chen']",Nature Precedings,https://www.nature.com/articles/npre.2010.5161.1.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1630,"Financing Methods for Small-Scale Hardwood Plantations in Queensland, Australia","Under Vision 2020 , a target was set in 1997 for trebling the forestry plantation area in Australia by the year 2020. Government subsidies and extension for plantation establishment have largely disappeared, hence forestry expansion is highly dependent on access to private finance. Plantation expansions throughout Australia has occurred predominantly through managed investment schemes, and to a lesser extent by joint venture schemes between landholders and government or private enterprise. Relatively small-scale hardwood plantations have been established, designed to replace the hardwood timber from the native forests that will be protected from further logging after 2024 under the Regional Forestry Agreements. Views on financing methods for forestry expansion in Queensland were investigated through by an email survey of 12 forestry and finance professionals, followed by in-depth personal interviews of the same group of key informants. Issues identified include lack of transparent information, inequitable taxation system between Managed Investment Scheme (MIS) companies and small-scale forest owners, need for further R&D on all aspects of the industry, and design of a strategic alliance model for forestry investors. Participants took the view that adoption of a strategic alliance model would encourage further investment in small-scale forestry and argued that this model could protect the interests of all the stakeholders through reducing investment risk and creating competitive advantage. The potential introduction of a carbon trading scheme also attracted interest from investors, who look for recognisable structures that may alleviate the risk of investing in an industry with which they are unfamiliar. The participants considered that further R&D should be the main focus for government participation in small-scale forestry, although recognizing current difficulties with information sharing.",2009-08-28,10.1007/s11842-009-9092-4,"['Velge, François', 'Harrison, Steve']",Small-scale Forestry,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11842-009-9092-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1631,Estimation and economic evaluation of aboveground carbon storage of Tectona grandis plantations in Western Panama,"Tropical tree plantations may play an important role in mitigating CO_2 emissions through their potential to capture and sequester carbon from the atmosphere. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as well as voluntary initiatives provide economic incentives for afforestation and reforestation efforts through the generation and sale of carbon credits. The objectives of our study were to measure the carbon (C) storage potential of 1, 2 and 10-years old Tectona grandis plantations in the province of Chiriquí, Western Panama and to calculate the monetary value of aboveground C storage if sold as Certified Emission Reduction (CER) carbon credits. The average aboveground C storage ranged from 2.9 Mg C ha^−1 in the 1-year-old plantations to 40.7 Mg C ha^−1 in the 10-year-old plantations. Using regression analysis we estimated the potential aboveground C storage of the teak plantation over a 20 year rotation period. The CO_2-storage over this period amounted to 191.1 Mg CO_2 ha^−1.

1633,BioBanking: an environmental scientist’s view of the role of biodiversity banking offsets in conservation,"Offsets, first formalised in the United States of America in the 1970s for wetland mitigation, are now widely used globally with the aim to mitigate loss of biodiversity due to development. Embracing biodiversity offsets is one method of governments to meet their commitments under the Millennium Development Goals and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Resource extraction companies see them as a method of gaining access to land, while the community may perceive them as a way of enhancing environmental outcomes. In New South Wales, Australia, BioBanking legislation was introduced in late 2006 with the aim of ‘no net loss’ of biodiversity associated with development, particularly expanding urban and coastal development. The strengths of the legislation are that it aims to enhance threatened species conservation, and raise the profile of conservation of threatened species and habitats. Weaknesses include (1) the narrowness of the definition of biodiversity; (2) the concepts are based on a flawed logic and immature, imprecise and complex science which results in difficulties in determining biodiversity values; (3) likely problems with management and compliance; and (4) an overall lack of resources for implementation and long-term monitoring. It is concluded that the legislation is a concerted effort to deal with biodiversity loss, however, stakeholders have concerns with the process, and it is unworkable with the complexity of such ecosystems (compared for example to carbon credit trading), and underdeveloped disciplines such as restoration biology and ecology. Despite these criticisms, there is a need for all stakeholders to work to improve the outcomes.",2008-04-01,10.1007/s10531-008-9319-2,"['Burgin, Shelley']",Biodiversity and Conservation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10531-008-9319-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1634,Greenhouse gas mitigation in developing countries through technology transfer?: a survey of empirical evidence,"While greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are projected to rise primarily in the developing countries, the potential for developing new GHG mitigation technologies exists primarily in the industrialized countries. It is thus important, not only for predictions about future emission paths but also for climate change mitigation policies, to understand how the international diffusion of such technologies takes place and how it affects the energy infrastructure and GHG emissions in developing countries. This paper provides an overview of the channels through which these technologies diffuse and focuses on the empirical evidence pertaining to the effects these technologies have on GHG emissions in developing countries.",2008-03-01,10.1007/s11027-007-9111-8,"['Peterson, Sonja']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-007-9111-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1635,Accounting for the utilization of a N_2O mitigation tool in the IPCC inventory methodology for agricultural soils,"In this study we review recent studies where dicyandiamide was used as a nitrification inhibitor to reduce both N_2O emissions from urine patches and nitrate leaching from pasture systems, and which led to the development of a commercial product for use on farmland. On average, emissions of N_2O and nitrate leaching were reduced by 72% and 61%, respectively. This study then demonstrates how a mitigation tool can be accounted for in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s inventory methodology when constructing an inventory of New Zealand’s agricultural soil N_2O emissions. The current New Zealand specific emission factors for EF1 (0.01), EF3_PRP (0.01) and Frac_LEACH (0.07) are amended to values of 0.0058, 0.0058 and 0.0455. Examples are also given, based on overseer ™ models, of the implications of farm management scenarios on N_2O inventories and total greenhouse gas production when using a N_2O mitigation tool; CO_2 equivalents kg^−1 milk solid decreased from 14.2 to as little as 11.7, depending on the management scenario modelled.",2007-05-01,10.1007/s10705-006-9069-z,"['Clough, T.

Economic Analyses of Sequestering Carbon in Loblolly Pine, Cherrybark Oak, and Northern Red Oak in the United States","Global concern over increasing carbon dioxide (CO_2) concentrations in the atmosphere leading to possible future climate changes have generated interest in offsetting CO_2 emissions by storing carbon in forests. Carbon-sequestering forest activities may be one of the least expensive approaches to mitigate the build up of atmospheric CO_2. However, the fact that forest management practices are species-, site-and management-objective-specific increases the complexity of using the forestry sector to mitigate global warming. In order to provide useful and timely information concerning carbon sequestration, this study investigated three forestry-based opportunities for sequestering carbon in the United States: conversion of marginal agricultural land to forests and reforestation of poorly stocked pine plantations in the South, afforestation of the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV), and reclamation and afforestation of abandoned mined lands (AML). This study conducted economic analyses on three region–species combinations: loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda L.) in the southern states, cherrybark oak ( Quercus pagoda Raf.) in the LMAV, and northern red oak ( Quercus rubra L.) on AML in West Virginia. The objectives of this study were to determine the profitability of managing these three commercial tree species for timber production only and for the combination of timber production and carbon sequestration and then calculate net tonnes of carbon stored during one rotation and net revenues generated from each tonne of carbon sequestered.",2004-07-01,10.1007/s00267-003-9129-y,"['Huang, Ching-Hsun', 'Bates, Richard', 'Kronrad, Gary D.', 'Cheng, Shiaolin']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-003-9129-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon credit trade"")",springer
1637,Estimating Chinese rural and urban residents’ carbon consumption and its drivers: considering capital formation as a productive input,"Estimating carbon emissions from the perspective of consumption and reducing carbon emission by guiding residents’ consumption is paid more and more attention by some countries and organizations. This study by considering the capital formation as a productive input of final consumer products estimates the carbon consumption of Chinese residents. Furthermore, it explores the driving factors of carbon consumption based on structural decomposition analysis. Results showed that the carbon consumption of Chinese residents (rural and urban) grew steadily. The annual carbon consumption by urban and rural residents increased at a rate of 9.94% and 0.81%, respectively. The average per capita indirect carbon consumption by urban residents during the period was 3.17 times of that by rural residents. Structural decomposition analysis showed that the structure of the urban and rural population and that of the total population are both critical factors promoting carbon consumption by residents, where the former is more powerful. The per capita product consumption caused an increase in the carbon intake of households, while the carbon emission intensity of industrial production decreased the carbon use. Although other factors also contributed to the increase in carbon consumption by residents, their role was comparatively less. This study also provides consumer-focused important carbon emission mitigation policy implications.",2020-08-01,10.1007/s10668-019-00432-2,"['Cao, Ming', 'Kang, Wei', 'Cao, Qingren', 'Sajid, M.

1638,Energy-based industrial symbiosis: a literature review for circular energy transition,"Nowadays, industrial symbiosis (IS) is recognized as a key strategy to support the transition toward the circular economy. IS deals with the (re)use of wastes produced by a production process as a substitute for traditional production inputs of other traditionally disengaged processes. In this context, this paper provides a systematic literature review on the energy-based IS approach, i.e., IS synergies aimed at reducing the amount of energy requirement from outside industrial systems or the amount of traditional fuels used in energy production. This approach is claimed as effective aimed at reducing the use of traditional fuels in energy production, thus promoting a circular energy transition. 682 papers published between 1997 and 2018 have been collected, and energy-based IS cases have been identified among 96 of these. As a result of the literature review, three categories of symbiotic synergies have been identified: (1) energy cascade; (2) fuel replacement; and (3) bioenergy production. Through the review, different strategies to implement energy-based IS synergies are highlighted and discussed for each of the above-mentioned categories. Furthermore, drivers, barriers, and enablers of business development in energy-based IS are discussed from the technical, economic, regulatory, and institutional perspective.

1639,Leader-follower optimized approach for carbon-economy equilibrium in the municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration industry,"Municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration contributes significantly to carbon emissions, and has become a serious problem in China, which has seen an exponential rise in waste over the last twenty years due to rapid urbanization and the associated consumer economy growth. To tackle this issue, this paper develops a leader-follower optimized approach for economic and environmental equilibrium in incineration power plants that includes a carbon allowance allocation scheme (IPP-CAAS) under combustion and pollutant limitations. In the leader-follower (bi-level) game, the regional authority on the upper level determines the carbon allocations and environmental targets and the IPPs on the lower level develop schemes to maximize revenue under the upper-level restrictions. By employing uncertain parameters for the carbon and power conversion fluctuations, the approach is able to more accurately depict the industry characteristics of waste incineration process in this carbon-economy balance problem. The robustness and practicality of the proposed methodology was then validated through a case study. Scenario analysis under different political parameters indicates that the proposed methodology can assist the authorities to achieve carbon-economy trade-off and under serious carbon-control situations, encourage the IPPs to reduce their blended coal ratios, and invest in low-carbon incineration technology. Managerial insights on further industrial developments are also given for the authority and relevant practitioners.",2020-06-08,10.1007/s11356-020-09076-6,"['Xu, Jiuping', 'Zhu, Mengyuan', 'Zhao, Siwei']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-09076-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1640,A regional-scale decomposition of energy-related carbon emission and its decoupling from economic growth in China,"China, known as the largest carbon emitter and the second largest economy worldwide, has continued to put effort into the understandings of the main drivers of carbon emission and their decoupling statuses from its economic growth. Considering the significant differences of natural and social environments in different regions of China, this paper presents a regional-scale decomposition of energy-related carbon emission and its decoupling from economic growth by using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) and the Tapio decoupling method. The decoupling results indicate that carbon emissions in all regions show a stable decoupling trend from their economic development, which means that China is now on the right road for achieving a low-carbon economy. However, the decoupling status by the end of 2016 also indicates that most of the regions are still in the states of expansive coupling or weak decoupling, especially in Northwest (NW), which implies that the speed of decarbonization process is still not high enough. The decomposition results show that in all regions except NW, GDP per capita is the most influential factor leading to increasing carbon emissions, while energy intensity is the largest factor in reducing carbon emissions. In NW, both GDP per capita and energy intensity drive the increase in carbon emissions. The results in this paper could benefit China’s regional policy-making and national strategies.",2020-06-01,10.1007/s11356-020-08567-w,"['Wang, Jianliang', 'Yang, Yuru']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-08567-w,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1641,Cost of CO_2 emission mitigation and its decomposition: evidence from coal-fired thermal power sector in India,"We estimate carbon mitigation cost (CMC) and the factors determining change in CMC using environmental production function. The CMC index is defined as the ratio of maximum production of electricity under unregulated and regulated production technology. Change in CMC index is decomposed into technical change, scale change and change in the level of CO_2 emissions. The production function is estimated for 45 coal-fired thermal power plants over the period of 2008–2012 using data envelopment analysis. Decomposition of CMC change reveals that impacts of changes in scale of operation and CO_2 emissions were more than the reduced costs realized due to technical changes.

1642,The asymmetric role of freight and passenger transportation in testing EKC in the US economy: evidence from QARDL approach,"This study examines the association between transportation services (i.e., passenger and freight) and carbon emissions concerning the US economy. The monthly data for this study were collected for the period from 2000 M1 to 2019 M8. In this study, QARDL econometric approach as discussed by Cho et al. ( 2015 ) has been used to tests the relationship between transportation services and CO2 emissions. Due to the chaotic and nonlinear behavior of our concerning variables, it was quite difficult to gauge the principle properties of their variations. Therefore, we relied on QARDL, which has been missing in previous researches. By utilizing the QARDL method, this research assesses the long-term stability of the nexus across the quantiles to provide an econometric framework that is more flexible than the traditional ones. In particular, the authors have analyzed how the quantiles of transportation (i.e., passenger and freight) influence the quantiles of CO2 emissions (environmental degradation). The empirical evidence revealed the negative significant relationship of both the transportation system (i.e., passenger and freight) with carbon emissions; however, this relationship holds at low quantiles of freight transport, whereas the same relationship has been observed at the majority of quantiles of passenger transport. So, this depicts that the transportation system of the USA helps to reduce CO2 emissions. Therefore, to maintain this situation, the government shall introduce more technologies that are fuel-efficient and promote clean consumption, thus reducing CO2 emissions, boosting economic growth, and making green transportation services.",2020-05-24,10.1007/s11356-020-09299-7,"['Godil, Danish Iqbal', 'Sharif, Arshian', 'Afshan, Sahar', 'Yousuf, Adnan', 'Khan, Syed Abdul Rehman']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-09299-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer

To ensure sustainable development, environment-friendly resources should be harnessed. Among these resources, renewable energy has the potential to mitigate environmental degradation. This study investigates the relationship between renewable, nonrenewable energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions by utilizing the panel data of South Asian countries over the period 1990–2014. The study used cross-sectional dependence test, Pedroni co-integration, fully modified ordinary least square, dynamic ordinary least square, and Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) panel causality test to find the relationships among the variables. Furthermore, the study used panel threshold regression to estimate the amount of renewable energy required for carbon dioxide mitigation. An increase in the share of renewable energy by 4.5143% of total energy will mitigate carbon emissions. The results suggest that renewable energy leads to an improved environment whereas nonrenewable energy contributes to environmental degradation. Finally, the findings of this study imply that the substitution of fossil fuel energy resources with renewable resources is an appealing alternative for sustainable development of the South Asian economies.",2020-05-16,10.1007/s42108-020-00073-6,"['Luni, T.', 'Majeed, M.

1644,Variability and uncertainty in forest biomass estimates from the tree to landscape scale: the role of allometric equations,"Background Biomass maps are valuable tools for estimating forest carbon and forest planning. Individual-tree biomass estimates made using allometric equations are the foundation for these maps, yet the potentially-high uncertainty and bias associated with individual-tree estimates is commonly ignored in biomass map error. We developed allometric equations for lodgepole pine ( Pinus contorta) , ponderosa pine ( P. ponderosa) , and Douglas-fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii) in northern Colorado. Plot-level biomass estimates were combined with Landsat imagery and geomorphometric and climate layers to map aboveground tree biomass. We compared biomass estimates for individual trees, plots, and at the landscape-scale using our locally-developed allometric equations, nationwide equations applied across the U.S., and the Forest Inventory and Analysis Component Ratio Method (FIA-CRM). Total biomass map uncertainty was calculated by propagating errors from allometric equations and remote sensing model predictions. Two evaluation methods for the allometric equations were compared in the error propagation—errors calculated from the equation fit (equation-derived) and errors from an independent dataset of destructively-sampled trees (n = 285). Results Tree-scale error and bias of allometric equations varied dramatically between species, but local equations were generally most accurate. Depending on allometric equation and evaluation method, allometric uncertainty contributed 30–75% of total uncertainty, while remote sensing model prediction uncertainty contributed 25–70%. When using equation-derived allometric error, local equations had the lowest total uncertainty (root mean square error percent of the mean [% RMSE] = 50%). This is likely due to low-sample size (10–20 trees sampled per species) allometric equations and evaluation not representing true variability in tree growth forms. When independently evaluated, allometric uncertainty outsized remote sensing model prediction uncertainty. Biomass across the 1.56 million ha study area and uncertainties were similar for local (2.1 billion Mg; % RMSE = 97%) and nationwide (2.2 billion Mg;  % RMSE = 94%) equations, while FIA-CRM estimates were lower and more uncertain (1.5 billion Mg;  % RMSE = 165%). Conclusions Allometric equations should be selected carefully since they drive substantial differences in bias and uncertainty. Biomass quantification efforts should consider contributions of allometric uncertainty to total uncertainty, at a minimum, and independently evaluate allometric equations when suitable data are available.",2020-05-14,10.1186/s13021-020-00143-6,"['Vorster, Anthony G.', 'Evangelista, Paul H.', 'Stovall, Atticus E.

1645,Investigating the pollution haven hypothesis in Cote d’Ivoire: evidence from autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach with structural breaks,"The pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) suggests that foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows contribute to rising carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions in developing countries. This study aims to investigate the validity of the PHH in Cote d’Ivoire. For this purpose, FDI, real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, energy consumption, and agriculture value added are included in the carbon dioxide emissions’ function. Based on time series data spanning from 1980 to 2014, the study utilized the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach. In addition to the introduction of structural breaks in the estimations techniques, this study contributes to the literature by focusing on a typical developing country that is currently experiencing increases both in FDI inflows and in CO_2 emissions. The findings indicated a cointegration relationship between the variables. Additionally, the ARDL results validate the PHH in Cote d’Ivoire as we find a positive relationship between FDI and CO_2 emissions. Likewise, the results showed that GDP per capita, energy consumption, and agriculture value added have a positive impact on CO_2 emissions. Based on the results, we advise Ivorian policymakers to strengthen the environmental regulations and focus on attracting clean FDI.

Using Mexico as a case study in the integration of these scales, we estimate mangrove carbon value and deforestation rates at the municipio (local government) scale and develop a prioritization model that indicates where to focus conservation efforts. By using previously published global models of carbon stocks, Mexico-specific carbon sequestration data, and calculating gross deforestation, we found that the current rate of deforestation will result in a social cost of 392.0 (± 7.4) million US$ over the next 25 years.

Our empirical findings suggest the presence of spatial dependence of carbon emissions distribution in West Africa. By examining the existence of EKC embedded within the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) approach, we conclude an inverse N-trajectory of the relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth. Furthermore, to mitigate global carbon emissions, we utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) algorithm devoid of exogenous variables and assumptions to forecast carbon emissions from the year 2015 to the year 2030 based on the predictive accuracy of our formulated algorithm. Due to the upward trends in future emission levels, we propose emissions mitigation pathways for countries in West Africa to still hold carbon emissions-related global warming well below 1.5 and 2 °C. Such mitigation pathways proposed could help implement strategic policies to minimize carbon emissions to a considerable level.

We confirm the long-run equilibrium relationship between carbon emissions, trade openness, fossil fuel usage, and GDP through the panel cointegration tests that is robust to cross-sectional dependence. Overall, our finding is that the empirical results show no consistent evidence of the EKC hypothesis in Annex I countries via mean group and long-run estimation. Country-specific estimation shows that only 5 of the 34 countries support the EKC hypothesis. From the cointegration test to long-run vector estimation, we indirectly show that fossil fuel usage can distort the EKC results by causing endogeneity, since being strong is related to economic growth. From the synthesized statistics of empirical results, Annex I countries do not follow the EKC relationship. This could imply that because no mitigation has been achieved, climate change can become a much more serious issue, although country-specific results show that mitigation is constantly in progress.",2020-03-01,10.1007/s11356-020-07668-w,"['Jin, Taeyoung', 'Kim, Jinsoo']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-07668-w,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer

However, the industrial consumption embedded emissions are not well investigated. This study estimates both the industrial production and consumption embedded emissions of Chinese households. Our results indicate significant differences between household industrial production and consumption embedded emissions. These different patterns are due to the different set of emission multipliers, Leontief inverse vectors, and final pull effects employed in embedding the intermediate carbon consumption to final demand. “Electricity, Steam, Hot water production and supply” was the largest source of both urban and rural household’s industrial production embedded emissions. The largest amount of urban household’s industrial consumption embedded emissions was from ‘Miscellaneous intangible products’; while, for rural households it was ‘Food and Tobacco’. Shandong had the highest industrial embedded emissions from both approaches; however, the main sources of its embedded production and consumption emissions were different. This embedding of the intermediate industrial consumption emissions to household final demand provides new insights, for mitigating the household embedded carbon consumption.

To avoid a reversal of the reduction convergence in the environmental field, mitigation strategies should aim to reduce the environmental risks posed by carbon inequality. This article uses the Gini index and Theil index to examine carbon inequality in the transport sector in China and decomposes the per capita carbon inequality using Kaya factors. Then, the variations within and between regions are analyzed by decomposing the Theil index of the carbon intensity by region. Our major findings are as follows. First, carbon inequality is relatively insignificant in the regional transport sector in China. Second, the main drivers of the per capita carbon inequality include the carbon intensity and per capita added value in the transport sector. Third, intra-regional components are major contributors to the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the carbon intensity, and the degree of carbon inequality in the eastern region is much greater than that in other regions. Moreover, the four economic regional components of the Theil index of the carbon intensity have had an obvious convergence effect since 2009.

1653,The Impact of Energy Innovation on Carbon Emission Mitigation: An Empirical Evidence from OECD Countries,"Over the past decades, the world has experienced an unprecedented increase in carbon emissions resulting in the emergence of climate change as a significant policy concern. Currently, environmental and energy policymakers are assessing carbon emission mitigation strategies through the lens of energy innovation. However, research linking energy innovation to carbon emissions remains limited in the literature. In this research, we deploy the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model to investigate the impact of energy innovation on carbon emissions in 26 OECD countries for the period 1974–2017. Our results from the fixed effect panel quantile regression revealed that energy innovation reduces carbon emission at the lower quantiles (10th, 20th, 30th, 40th, 50th) while it increases carbon emissions at the 70th and 80th quantile. Our results also indicate that population size, energy intensity, and service and industrial sectors increase carbon emissions, while urbanization and affluence mitigate carbon emissions. The policy implications are discussed.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-58538-3_213-1,"['Dzator, Janet', 'Acheampong, Alex O.']",Handbook of Environmental Materials Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-58538-3_213-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1654,Integration of Power to Gas and Carbon Capture,"This chapter aims to demonstrate that Power to Gas can be effectively integrated with carbon capture processes to increase the global efficiency of the energy storage and provide a carbon source for fuel conversion. In particular there are two capture technologies analysed and applied to industrial boilers: amine scrubbing and oxyfuel technologies. In the last option, optimum integration could be achieved by using the oxygen from Power to Gas into the oxyfuel combustion process. Moreover, in both options, the suggested energy integration uses methanation heat to supply thermal energy to the CO_2 capture or for industrial process.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-46527-8_2,"['Bailera, Manuel', 'Lisbona, Pilar', 'Peña, Begoña', 'Romeo, Luis M.']",Energy Storage,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-46527-8_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1655,Exploring Research Methods and Dynamic Systems Toward Economic Development: An Overview,"Research methods and dynamic systems toward economic development are determined by different policies which place emphasis on different, occasionally contradicting, aspects. Environment, economy, and energy issues are commonly developed in a conflicting manner. Therefore, policy makers have to adjust key parameters, including energy utilization, environmental investment, technological investment, and others, to make adopted models to reach a state of balanced and sustainable development. At this study, relevant research studies were gathered, grouped, and classified upon the following three scientific fields: technology and energy; knowledge economy—innovation ecosystems—knowledge-based development; local–regional–geographical contexts. Besides, an aggregated table of nine-leveled entries was formulated in order to determine the key aspects upon research methods and dynamic systems’ explored. Future research orientations for public authorities, energy makers, and policy makers were succinctly addressed, while concluding remarks upon synergy propositions of environmental, resources, and technology choices that foster the realization of continuous and sustainable development of economic-centered dynamic systems were outlined.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-981-15-2244-4_1,"['Kyriakopoulos, G.

1656,Climate Policy,"The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as early as in 1976 talked about the potential ill effects of the increased accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere on the future climate and weather. The WMO along with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) did establish the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988 with a mandate to provide scientific information to governments on the risks associated with climate change and its impacts on natural and human systems. No doubt climate change is one of the defining challenges of the twenty-first century having a profound impact on the needs of the global population, poverty alleviation, sustenance of natural ecosystems and food security. Climate change is no longer considered to be just an environmental concern but also a development problem affecting both the developing and developed countries. One of the central policy issues in the context of climate change is how countries of the world should allocate resources. After a few years of intense engagement and international negotiation processes, the world community has signed the historic Paris climate agreement in 2015, which calls for substantive domestic and international climate actions to tackle climate issues. Individual countries are making efforts to strengthen their “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions” (INDCs) by streamlining their mitigation and adaptation initiatives. Some of the areas where investments have been made to reshape policies and actions include (i) renewable energy, (ii) building of rural and urban resilience capacity, (iii) poverty alleviation and (iv) sectoral priorities. The environmental governance focus is also shifting from National to the sub-National and local level. Internationally, there have been considerable efforts in synchronising the INDC commitments with the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs). One of the key policy agreement that Parties entered under the Paris agreement is to stabilise rising temperature below 2 °C preferably to limit to 1.5 °C. At the local level, policy actions should focus on assessing the vulnerability of both physical and social systems to climate change, development of best bet technology to reduce the impacts of climate change and measures to enhance the adaptive capacities of local communities and enhance overall climate risk management capacity of the region. Transformative changes could be achieved by developing and executing proactive environmental and climate risk management policies, promoting effective implementation strategies and linking responsive institutions across scales for achieving activities effectively. Though developed countries are fundamentally responsible for global warming, the major impacts are borne by poor and marginalised countries. Hence, the international climate regime needs innovative climate policies and institutional structures that would help promote international cooperation. It is also imperative to design and implement appropriate national climate policies that would contribute to individual countries’ green growth and promote climate-sensitive development. This chapter focuses on the elements that go into the making of climate policy and their relevance to the emerging global and national scenarios.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-981-13-9570-3_2,"['T.

This sector also takes on a dominant role in the anthropogenic disturbance in the carbon cycle in this region due, in part, to the extensive grazing and browsing of the livestock. In the HKH, livestock biomass use contributes towards the first step of the human appropriation of net primary production, which has an estimated value (3.69 ton/cap per year) higher than the Asian average. Methane emissions from the main sources, that is, enteric fermentation and manure, amount to 3.77 million tons per year, while the high emission zones are found in the mixed livestock cropping systems.

1658,Sustainable Development Goals as a Tool to Evaluate Multidimensional Clean Energy Initiatives,"Great contributions are expected by the public from science and technology (S&T), especially now, given the highly complex environmental and social challenges such as climate change, cleaner and affordable energy provision and economic crises, among others. These problems require a multidimensional approach involving all stakeholders working together: government, non-governmental organizations, funding agents, companies, academy and society. Based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) launched in 2015, actions have been carried out to develop capacities for the 2030 Energy Agenda in Brazil. Hence, this work aims to present a case study of the actions being developed in the analysis and integration of clean energy initiatives employing natural gas, biogas, hydrogen and Carbon Capture and Storage of CO_2 (CCS). Particularly, this work focus on the experiences of the Research Centre for Gas Innovation (RCGI), created in 2016 by the University of São Paulo, Shell and the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP). This integration of strategic partnerships that incorporates academy, a private company and a research funding agency is evolving through 46 research projects that aim to contribute with sustainable solutions for the Energy agenda.

1659,Introduction,"Two paths remain available with respect to catastrophic human-caused environment change. One is the path of collective action on the parts of people and governments in most, if not all, countries, and all of those in the Global North, to massively reduce the effects of human activity and prevent the catastrophic changes to the environment that are threatening the end of humanity. The other path is that of widespread inaction with limited, ad hoc and, at best, piecemeal efforts on the parts of people and governments in some countries to address catastrophic human-caused environment change. This leads to both a profound reduction to the planet’s habitability and a deep disturbance of human societies and international politics to the point that humanity ends. This book explains both the politics that has and will continue to ensure that the second path is followed and the politics that will result from following that path. Before we get to this, some features of this book: its reliance on a near worst-case scenario, my decision to begin the final hundred years of humanity at 2030, what I mean by ‘of humanity’, the (uncomfortably) speculative nature of this book and what I am will cover in this book.",2020-01-01,10.1007/978-981-15-1259-9_1,"['Cook, Ian']",The Politics of the Final Hundred Years of Humanity (2030-2130),http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-15-1259-9_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1660,Examining the determinants of energy-related carbon emissions in Central Asia: country-level LMDI and EKC analysis during different phases,"Central Asia is a major emerging energy player but is also affected by global climate change. To both maintain its economic growth and cope with climate change, Central Asia is in urgent need of environmental and sustainable energy strategies, as well as effective carbon emissions mitigation. To this end, we investigated the characteristics of country-level total carbon emissions in Central Asia (i.e., Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan). Then, the logarithmic mean Divisia index method was applied to identify and quantify the driving forces behind the changes in carbon emissions. In addition, country-level long-run relationships between economic growth and carbon emissions were tested by means of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. The results are as follows. (1) There were pronounced differences in per capita gross domestic product, energy intensity, and carbon emissions structures across this region, mainly owing to the oil and gas endowment and economic development stage. (2) Impacts and influences of various drivers of carbon emissions varied across countries over the different stages. (3) During the economic recession period, carbon emissions decreases were largely driven by the decreasing economic growth effect associated with political instability. (4) During the economic transition periods, economic growth effect played a dominant positive role in accelerating carbon emissions in the five countries, followed by the population scale effect. Energy intensity effect was the most important factor in curbing carbon emissions in the five countries. Emissions increases during these periods were partly or largely compensated by the improving energy intensity in the different countries. Carbon intensity effect mostly had a negative but relatively minor effect on carbon emissions. (5) There was only an inverted U-shaped curve existing in the lower-middle-income country (Uzbekistan). Considering these differences and disparities in emissions characteristics and determinants can provide important insights for the energy sustainability and carbon mitigation in Central Asia.",2019-12-05,10.1007/s10668-019-00545-8,"['Wang, Fei', 'Wang, Changjian', 'Chen, Jing', 'Li, Zeng', 'Li, Ling']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-019-00545-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1661,Greenhouse gas emissions–crude oil prices: an empirical investigation in a nonlinear framework,"The present study examines the relationship between crude oil prices, one of the major inputs, of economic activity and environmental degradation as reflected in the volume of carbon emissions. The nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag cointegration approach was employed to study the intertemporal causal crude oil prices–carbon emissions relationship. Our findings confirm long-run asymmetry in both directions of the relationship studied. In the short run, asymmetric effects are confirmed running only from carbon emissions to the crude oil prices. Furthermore, it is validated that the climate change mitigation policies are effective in the long run, though this is not the case in the short run. The quantification of this relationship outlines the key role of crude oil prices to sustainable economic growth conditional to environmental policies in global terms.",2019-12-01,10.1007/s10668-018-0163-6,"['Constantinos, Katrakilidis', 'Eleni, Zafeiriou', 'Nikolaos, Sariannidis', 'Bantis, Dimitris']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-018-0163-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1662,Synergy potential between climate change mitigation and forest conservation policies in the Indonesian forest sector: implications for achieving multiple sustainable development objectives,"There has been growing interest in achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by identifying effective interactions or synergy potential among measures/policies on sustainable development. The simultaneous implementation of climate change mitigation (SDG 13) and forest protection (SDG 15) is an example of an interaction where the measures/policies that contribute to both goals can be identified and the overlaps eliminated. However, there are limited studies that quantitatively evaluate the synergy potential in the forest sector. This study is the first attempt to examine the synergy potential in the forest sector in Indonesia focusing on climate change mitigation and forest protection. We evaluated four scenarios that differentiated climate and forest policy options and assessed the effectiveness of implementing these two policies simultaneously by 2030, using a computable general equilibrium model and a land-use model. We found that the additional efforts needed for emission reduction were larger for the scenario not considering forest protection than for that considering forest protection. This caused differences in the mitigation measures introduced and the resulting land use that depended on the scenario. Consequently, mitigation costs would be reduced by implementing mitigation and forest protection policies simultaneously, suggesting that the synergy effect in the forest sector in Indonesia does exist. This also implies simultaneous contributions to SDGs 13 and 15 (Targets 13.2 and 15.2). To realize such synergies, which have not yet been considered, it is necessary for policymakers to fill the institutional gaps between the policies/strategies of mitigation and forest conservation and enforce the policies for SDGs.",2019-11-01,10.1007/s11625-018-0650-6,"['Matsumoto, Ken’ichi', 'Hasegawa, Tomoko', 'Morita, Kanako', 'Fujimori, Shinichiro']",Sustainability Science,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11625-018-0650-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1663,"Renewables, food (in)security, and inflation regimes in the coastline Mediterranean countries (CMCs): the environmental pros and cons","In the present (twenty-first) century, the pertinent challenge of attaining the regime of food security with low pollution amidst the drive for sustainable economy and energy efficiency is core to governance and intergovernmental agencies. Therefore, in an attempt to investigate environmental issues among the coastline Mediterranean countries (CMCs) for the first time, the current study examines the dynamic long-run nexus of carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions with food production and inflation rate over the annual period 1995–2014. Using a dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach, the consumption of renewable energy in the panel of sixteen (16) CMCs is empirically observed to be an efficient policy vehicle for mitigating CO_2 emissions. Also, in all the examined CMCs, consumption of renewables is observed to cause significant decline in CO_2 emissions, thus securing a sustainable environment. However, in the long run and in the panel of CMCs, the study reveals that increase in food production (a drive toward food security) increases environmental risk. Additionally, the study found that high inflation regime in the panel CMCs is associated with low CO_2 emissions especially in the long-run, thus necessitating efficient policy mechanism. In adopting the genetic resources of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources, as well as employing price control policy, the members of the CMCs might have unearthed a suitable policy directive in effectively sustaining environmental quality.",2019-11-01,10.1007/s11356-019-06576-y,"['Alola, Andrew Adewale', 'Yalçiner, Kürşat', 'Alola, Uju Violet']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-019-06576-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1664,Effects of electricity consumption on carbon intensity across Chinese manufacturing sectors,"This research aims to study the effect on industrial carbon intensity by decomposing electricity consumption into electricity consumption volume and electric power intensity by using panel data of 27 China’s manufacturing sectors. An improved STIRPAT model is also developed by this article to identify the unexplored potential influencing factors. The research findings suggest that there exists a long-run equilibrium relationship between electricity consumption and carbon intensity and unidirectional causality from electricity consumption volume to carbon intensity. Regression results indicate that electricity consumption volume has a significantly negative effect on industrial carbon intensity for the full sample. However, due to the significantly positive influence that electric power intensity has on carbon intensity, we conclude that energy consumption and industrial economy failed to achieve the decoupling effect. The impacts of electricity consumption volume and electric power intensity have industrial heterogeneity. Electric power intensity impacts carbon intensity the most for resource intensive sectors. The effects of subgroups are further examined for sectors with high/low carbon emission volume and carbon intensity. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is conducive to reducing carbon intensity for sectors with high volume and sectors with high intensity. Industrialization level demonstrates a significantly positive effect on improving carbon intensity for sectors with low volume and sectors with low intensity. Finally, we put forward specific suggestions on the basis of these empirical findings.",2019-09-01,10.1007/s11356-019-05955-9,"['Zhang, Huan']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-019-05955-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1665,"The cultural politics of climate branding: Project Sunlight, the biopolitics of climate care and the socialisation of the everyday sustainable consumption practices of citizens-consumers","Many corporations are now in the business of bringing climate change ‘home’ in the everyday products that those, in much of the Minority world, can purchase and use, providing opportunities for consumers to literally and figuratively ‘buy in’ to climate mitigation. Yet, what are the implications of this form of highly commoditised, corporate-led, consumer-focused climate branding? In the spaces and practices of the everyday, how and in what ways are corporations framing and socialising responses to climate change and global environmental and social issues? This paper explores these 'questions through a multimodal discourse analysis of Unilever’s ‘Sustainable Living Plan’ ( 2010 ) and its ‘Project Sunlight’ campaign (2010–2016). Situating Unilever’s sustainability agenda as indicative of the contemporary climate politics of the corporate sector, that also represents a pivotal moment in the cultural politics of climate change, we critically interrogate Unilever’s mobilisation of the affective and emotional registers of everyday life and human relations in its model of sustainable living. Specifically, we focus on the ways that Unilever encourages acts of branded consumption as a form of—what we call here—climate care, by invoking normative discourses of gender and family through a form of biopolitics, and, at a larger scale, how the corporation is shaping how particular forms of climate capitalism are socialised, normalised and practiced. In doing so, we shift critical attention away from sustainable business analyses of Unilever onto the unexplored socio-cultural dimensions of Unilever’s sustainability model. We argue that Unilever’s socialisation of climate branding and care works to depoliticise climate change actions and actors through a biopolitics that creates a false veneer of democratisation in the form of consumer choice, thereby curtailing more progressive societal action on climate change.",2019-07-16,10.1007/s10584-019-02487-6,"['Doyle, Julie', 'Farrell, Nathan', 'Goodman, Michael K.']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-019-02487-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1666,Estimating the potential of energy saving and carbon emission mitigation of cassava-based fuel ethanol using life cycle assessment coupled with a biogeochemical process model,"Global warming and increasing concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) have prompted considerable interest in the potential role of energy plant biomass. Cassava-based fuel ethanol is one of the most important bioenergy and has attracted much attention in both developed and developing countries. However, the development of cassava-based fuel ethanol is still faced with many uncertainties, including raw material supply, net energy potential, and carbon emission mitigation potential. Thus, an accurate estimation of these issues is urgently needed. This study provides an approach to estimate energy saving and carbon emission mitigation potentials of cassava-based fuel ethanol through LCA (life cycle assessment) coupled with a biogeochemical process model—GEPIC (GIS-based environmental policy integrated climate) model. The results indicate that the total potential of cassava yield on marginal land in China is 52.51 million t; the energy ratio value varies from 0.07 to 1.44, and the net energy surplus of cassava-based fuel ethanol in China is 92,920.58 million MJ. The total carbon emission mitigation from cassava-based fuel ethanol in China is 4593.89 million kgC. Guangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian are identified as target regions for large-scale development of cassava-based fuel ethanol industry.

1667,"Cement production, environmental pollution, and economic growth: evidence from China and USA","The study focuses on the nonlinear Granger causality between cement production, economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions by Markov-switching vector autoregressive (MScVAR) and Markov-switching Granger causality approach for the period of 1960–2017 for China and the USA. The empirical findings from MSIA(2)-VAR(2) for the USA and MSIA(3)-VAR(3) for China suggest that cement production has an important impact on CO_2 emissions and economic growth. Markov-switching causality approach determines the evidence of unidirectional causality running from cement production to carbon dioxide emissions in all regimes for the USA and China. The cement production is an important source of environmental pollution. The USA and China have global responsibility for cement production determined as one of the central sources of carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, MS-Granger causality results were compared with ones determined by traditional causality method. It was determined that to employ traditional method instead of MS-causality method can cause wrong policy applications if the tested series has nonlinearity.

1668,Assessing Institutional Responses to Climate Change Impacts in the North-Eastern Floodplains of Bangladesh,"Bangladesh encounters diverse climate change impacts at different scales, which can severely affect rural communities and livelihoods. In response, the government of Bangladesh has initiated a number of institutional interventions through development plans to better support sustainable adaptation. There have, however, been relatively few assessments of how these interventions have impacted sustainable local adaptation. Focusing on the highly climate-affected north-eastern floodplain region of Bangladesh, this paper presents the results of a literature synthesis supported by primary field data to identify how existing policy barriers can threaten institutional responses to climate change impacts, while institutional rigidity and the non-inclusiveness of bureaucratic polity work to undermine efficiency, effectiveness, and equitability—some important considerations for sustainable adaptation.

1669,Is Indonesian peatland loss a cautionary tale for Peru? A two-country comparison of the magnitude and causes of tropical peatland degradation,"Indonesia and Peru harbor some of the largest lowland tropical peatland areas. Indonesian peatlands are subject to much greater anthropogenic activity than Peru’s, including drainage, logging, agricultural conversion, and burning, resulting in high greenhouse gas and particulate emissions. To derive insights from the Indonesian experience, we explored patterns of impact in the two countries, and compared their predisposing factors. Impacts differ greatly among Indonesian regions and the Peruvian Amazon in the following order: Sumatra > Kalimantan > Papua > Peru. All impacts, except fire, are positively related to population density. Factors enhancing Indonesian peatlands’ susceptibility to disturbance include peat doming that facilitates drainage, coastal location, high local population, road access, government policies permitting peatland use, lack of enforcement of protections, and dry seasons that favor extensive burning. The main factors that could reduce peatland degradation in Peru compared with Indonesia are geographic isolation from coastal population centers, more compact peatland geomorphology, lower population and road density, more peatlands in protected areas, different land tenure policies, and different climatic drivers of fire; whereas factors that could enhance peatland degradation include oil and gas development, road expansion in peatland areas, and an absence of government policies explicitly protecting peatlands. We conclude that current peatland integrity in Peru arises from a confluence of factors that has slowed development, with no absolute barriers protecting Peruvian peatlands from a similar fate to Indonesia’s. If the goal is to maintain the integrity of Peruvian peatlands, government policies recognizing unique peatland functions and sensitivities will be necessary.",2019-04-15,10.1007/s11027-018-9790-3,"['Lilleskov, Erik', 'McCullough, Kevin', 'Hergoualc’h, Kristell', 'Castillo Torres, Dennis', 'Chimner, Rodney', 'Murdiyarso, Daniel', 'Kolka, Randy', 'Bourgeau-Chavez, Laura', 'Hribljan, John', 'Aguila Pasquel, Jhon', 'Wayson, Craig']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-018-9790-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1670,"Scenarios for withdrawal of oil palm plantations from peatlands in Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia","In Indonesia, peatlands are still being converted into oil palm plantations. The associated fires and peat oxidation result in smoke and large carbon emissions. In the medium term, peatlands should be used for production systems that do not require (or require much less) drainage. In this context, this study aims to explore scenarios for the withdrawal of oil palm plantations from peatlands in Jambi province and the associated carbon emissions in the coming decades. We first analyzed past land-use change trends in Jambi peatlands. Then, we analyzed three scenarios for the future: (1) a baseline scenario, assuming further expansions by smallholders, but not by companies, (2) a scenario assuming withdrawal from peat by companies only, and (3) a scenario assuming withdrawal from peat by companies and smallholders. In both scenarios 1 and 2, it is assumed smallholders keep on expanding oil palm plantations in peatlands up to 2020 but not thereafter. To accommodate economic interests of growers, withdrawal of oil palm plantations is assumed to only take place when the palm trees are 25 years old and their productivity starts declining. Our study shows that there has been a rapid expansion of oil palm plantations in peatlands of Jambi from 30,000 ha in 1987 to 483,000 ha in 2014. In our baseline scenario, involving commitments from companies but not from smallholders, the area of oil palm further increases by 20% between 2014 and 2040; this implies that by 2040, almost all peatlands, including those in the buffer zone of Berbak National Park, will have been converted to plantations. The corresponding greenhouse gas emissions are 53 Mt CO_2-equivalent per year (from both peat decomposition and fires). In the scenario assuming withdrawal of company plantations from peatlands, the plantation area will be reduced to half that in the baseline scenario in 2040. This would decrease CO_2-equivalent emissions in 2040 to below 2010 levels (27.9 Mt per year). Our study shows that a substantial decrease in emissions is only possible in scenario 3 with an almost full withdrawal of plantations from peatlands by 2040.

1671,The impact of public transportation on carbon emissions: a panel quantile analysis based on Chinese provincial data,"Although the Chinese government emphasizes the significance of public transportation development and encourages green travel, no empirical study has examined whether the expansion of public transportation facilitates the mitigation of carbon emissions. To this end, we employ a panel quantile regression to test the endogenous relationship between public transportation scale and carbon emissions. The results suggest that the effect of public transportation scale on carbon emissions is heterogeneous across China’s provinces based on the level of carbon emissions. Even so, the results still support a stable inverted U-shaped relationship between public transportation scale and carbon emissions for provinces with different levels of carbon emissions. That is, when public transportation scale exceeds a threshold value, the relationship between public transportation and carbon emissions will turn from positive to negative. Our findings provide evidence advocating for public transportation development and green travel. It is of great significance for China to respond to climate changes.",2019-02-08,10.1007/s11356-018-3921-y,"['Jiang, Yong', 'Zhou, Zhongbao', 'Liu, Cenjie']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-018-3921-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer

The main aim is to understand the suitability of commonly used voting rules as a potential mechanism for collective decision making in platoon applications considering unreliable communications. To realistically assess the system performance, we designed an integrated simulation platform composed of an agent-based platform, a microscopic traffic and a vehicular network models. Results show the viability of these simple voting mechanism to maintain high satisfaction among platoon members, which that can lead to stable formations and consequently better traffic conditions.

1673,Peruvian Amazonian Natives and Climate Change: Minorities Facing a Global Problem,"Indigenous people knowledge is classified as comprehension of the skills, practices and ideologies of cultures that have had long histories of harmonious living with their natural surroundings. This knowledge forms important contributions to the world’s adaptive capabilities and is a contributor to the accomplishments of the 2030 Paris Agreement. Granting land rights to indigenous people societies has been proven to significantly curb deforestation and thus is a low-cost solution to reducing carbon emissions. Considering the importance of indigenous people knowledge, and the role the Amazon rainforest and its original inhabitants play in climate change, a three-month Participatory Action Research approach was embarked upon in various communities of the Peruvian Amazon. This paper aims to highlight how the Peruvian government and external agents have interacted with the natives throughout history and emphasises the outcomes of these encounters in regard to the protection of indigenous people knowledge, the rainforest and climate change. Due to the short time span of the field research, the indigenous people communities where the primary knowledge was obtained cannot be representative of the whole Peruvian Amazon; however, together with the literature review and further research, the stance of both the Peruvian government and the indigenous people populations can be seen. While evidence shows that the world has never been better geared towards legally granting the indigenous people land rights, the results in this paper seem to indicate that Peru’s progress towards securing tenure rights and upholding the sustainable development goals highlighted in the Conference of Parties and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is not being met, and consequently, the knowledge, rights and lives of the natives are being overlooked, causing a ripple effect on the rest of the world.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-89590-1_22,"['Constant, Guillermo Mandelli', 'Amaral, Erika Sänger', 'Paucar-Caceres, Alberto', 'Prieto, Silvia Quispe', 'Ramos, Manuel Caipa']",University Initiatives in Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-89590-1_22,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer

This cooperative behaviour also extends to security. More connected and cooperative components of vehicular intelligent transportation systems (ITS) result in an increased potential for malicious attacks that can negatively impact security and safety. The security risks in one architecture layer affect other layers of ITS; thus, cooperation is essential for secure operations of these systems. This paper presents results from a comprehensive literature review on the state-of-the-art of security risk management in vehicular ITS, evaluating its assets, threats/risks, and countermeasures.

1675,Natural Carbon Sequestration by Forestry,"Carbon dioxide (CO_2) levels have been rapidly rising in the atmosphere following the beginning of industrialisation and reaching new highs in the last recent years. Global carbon cycle studies established that the interannual variability in observed atmospheric CO_2 growth rates is attributed mainly to interannual inconsistent changes in carbon sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems, instead to oceans or changes in anthropogenic emissions. This terrestrial ecosystems sink is mainly in the forests of the world, which are enormous repositories of both biomass and soil carbon. In 1997, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) at Kyoto agreed on a protocol with an aim of reducing anthropogenic CO_2 emissions in the atmosphere through terrestrial ecosystems CO_2 sequestration. This ignited increased interest and efforts from the science community since the beginning of the twenty-first century, to probe the potential of terrestrial ecosystems CO_2 assimilation in offsetting the anthropogenic CO_2 impact in the atmosphere and subsequently in the global climate; this also inspired investigations on the role of environment and climate variables on the land ecosystems carbon sequestration. This study reviews the developments in the understanding of the role of the terrestrial biosphere mainly the forests in anthropogenic carbon sequestration. It first examines the influence of the environment and climate variables in the global carbon cycle processes of the terrestrial ecosystems, including the effects of climate extremes. Then it assimilates the knowledge in global carbon budget generated in the past few decades. Studies indicate that the combined effect of nitrogen deposition, high atmospheric CO_2, warm climate, increased diffuse radiation support the capability of the terrestrial ecosystems to assimilate atmospheric carbon. Extreme climate change events and disturbances (ECE&D) can transform land ecosystems from sinks into sources. The aggregate of the global terrestrial ecosystems CO_2 net sink has been growing in the sequence of 0.1 ± 0.8, 1.1 ± 0.9 and 1.5 ± 0.9 Pg C year ^−1, in the past few decades of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, respectively.

In order to better understand the regional interaction of carbon emissions, this paper employs a three-region input-output approach to explore the linkage of CO_2 emissions among China, EU, and USA. Based on the world input-output table and environment account of World Input-Output Database (WIOD) in 2009, we calculate the carbon emission multiplier effect, spillover effect, and feedback effect and carry out the analysis from the regional and sectoral levels. The results show that, first of all, the carbon emission multiplier effect of each region is larger than the spillover and feedback effects. Second, EU and USA have higher carbon emission spillover effect on China than China’s carbon emission spillover effect on them.

1679,"Low-carbon emission development in Asia: energy sector, waste management and environmental management system","Mitigation of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions is desirable without compromising the economic growth. This paper reviews the recent trends to mitigate GHG emissions in the key sectors of energy and solid waste. The energy sector is the key admitter for global GHG emissions, and a range of optimisation and modelling tool has been developed to minimise the GHG emissions and overall cost, especially for the implementation of renewable energies such as biofuel and biogas. A few carbon sequestration technologies such as the carbon capture and storage (CCS) and biochar application have been reviewed. The review included the challenges and knowledge gaps regarding the utilisation of CCS, such as the storage capacity, long-term policy framework, high costs and the potential risk. Although solid waste contributes about < 5% of the global GHG emissions, effective solid waste management remained a great challenge in many fast-growing cities in Asia. Considering the high organic portion (> 40%) in the municipal solid waste for many developing countries in Asia, composting has been proposed as a viable treatment technology to convert waste-to-wealth. A range of waste management tools, including scenario analyses on different waste technologies, optimisation of waste collection routes, multi-criteria decision tools, is reviewed to support the decision-making for solid waste management. A range of environmental management system (EMS) has been adopted by organisations to improve product quality, reducing production cost and improves reputation of firms. An environmental policy such as tax exemption could be helpful to promote the adoption of EMS that could be costly. CO_2 and material flow footprint tools, such as water–energy–materials nexus, are applicable at a city and regional level. The tools are used to mitigate GHG emissions by developing the mechanisms with shared markets of virtual resource flows (carbon, water, food, energy) between the trading partners regionally and internationally.",2018-04-01,10.1007/s10098-018-1512-8,"['Lee, Chew Tin', 'Mohammad Rozali, Nor Erniza', 'Fan, Yee', 'Klemeš, Jiří Jaromír', 'Towprayoon, Sirintornthep']",Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10098-018-1512-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1680,An optimization study of a palm oil-based regional bio-energy supply chain under carbon pricing and trading policies,"Biomass residues due to their low bulk density typically require frequent transportation from biomass plantations in rural areas to conversion bio-energy power plants. This issue contrasts with environmental protection strategies, especially when power plants are facing different carbon reduction policies that enforce them to emit less than a given specific carbon amount. Although several researchers have investigated bio-energy supply chains concerning environmental policies, the majority of studies have been devoted to strategic decisions over a single planning period. This paper presents a multi-period bio-energy supply chain under carbon pricing (carbon tax) and carbon trading (cap-and-trade) policies at the tactical planning level. A mixed-integer linear programming model was adopted to optimize the proposed regional oil-palm biomass-to-bio-energy supply chain planning model. The numerical results indicate that when carbon pricing is in place when carbon tax increases linearly, carbon emissions’ reductions have a nonlinear trend, whereas both cost increase and carbon emissions’ reductions have a relatively upward trend in the carbon trading scheme. This paper also presents the sensitivity analysis of the proposed model regarding cost, emissions’ generation and supply chain performance.

The scale of this investment required to decouple carbon emissions from economic growth, will inevitably have to rely largely on mobilizing private capital. This chapter provides an overview of available channels to mobilize private investment in low-carbon transition. It argues that the private capital that can be mobilized to support low-carbon transition, is very much depend on the risk return profile of the investment and the regulatory environment in which these investors operate. If the governments wish to mobilize capital from the markets, they need to simultaneously understand not only the barriers to the investment but also effective channels through which such capital can flow.

1687,Applying a Ruggiero three-stage super-efficiency DEA model to gauge regional carbon emission efficiency: evidence from China,"China’s climate change mitigation strategies and efforts are based on accurate regional carbon emission efficiency (CEE) estimates. Decision-making units which are all data envelopment analysis (DEA)-effective cannot be ranked by using the original DEA model. While previous studies omit environmental factors when gauging resources or environmental efficiency. In this study, we combine a Ruggiero three-stage model with a super-efficiency DEA model (SE-DEA) to solve these two problems. Following this method, we consider environmental factors and thereby compare provincial CEE in China in the new production frontier. The main results obtained are as follows: (1) provincial CEE values differ significantly in the first stage and the third stage; (2) in the third stage, only Eastern China reaches the SE-DEA relatively effective level, where CEE rankings in descending order are: Eastern, Central, and Western China; (3) provinces are divided into four categories in terms of provincial CEE values and per-capita GDPs, and therefore, regional climate and development policies could be oriented due to different categories.

1689,Implications of overestimated anthropogenic CO_2 emissions on East Asian and global land CO_2 flux inversion,"Measurement and modelling of regional or country-level carbon dioxide (CO_2) fluxes are becoming critical for verification of the greenhouse gases emission control. One of the commonly adopted approaches is inverse modelling, where CO_2 fluxes (emission: positive flux, sink: negative flux) from the terrestrial ecosystems are estimated by combining atmospheric CO_2 measurements with atmospheric transport models. The inverse models assume anthropogenic emissions are known, and thus the uncertainties in the emissions introduce systematic bias in estimation of the terrestrial (residual) fluxes by inverse modelling. Here we show that the CO_2 sink increase, estimated by the inverse model, over East Asia (China, Japan, Korea and Mongolia), by about 0.26 PgC year^−1 (1 Pg = 10^12 g) during 2001–2010, is likely to be an artifact of the anthropogenic CO_2 emissions increasing too quickly in China by 1.41 PgC year^−1. Independent results from methane (CH_4) inversion suggested about 41% lower rate of East Asian CH_4 emission increase during 2002–2012. We apply a scaling factor of 0.59, based on CH_4 inversion, to the rate of anthropogenic CO_2 emission increase since the anthropogenic emissions of both CO_2 and CH_4 increase linearly in the emission inventory. We find no systematic increase in land CO_2 uptake over East Asia during 1993–2010 or 2000–2009 when scaled anthropogenic CO_2 emissions are used, and that there is a need of higher emission increase rate for 2010–2012 compared to those calculated by the inventory methods. High bias in anthropogenic CO_2 emissions leads to stronger land sinks in global land–ocean flux partitioning in our inverse model. The corrected anthropogenic CO_2 emissions also produce measurable reductions in the rate of global land CO_2 sink increase post-2002, leading to a better agreement with the terrestrial biospheric model simulations that include CO_2-fertilization and climate effects.",2017-05-16,10.1186/s40562-017-0074-7,"['Saeki, Tazu', 'Patra, Prabir K.']",Geoscience Letters,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40562-017-0074-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1690,Evaluating policy-relevant research: lessons from a series of theory-based outcomes assessments,"The increasing external demand from research funders and research managers to assess, evaluate and demonstrate the quality and the effectiveness of research is well known. Less discussed, but equally important, is the evolving interest and use of research evaluation to support learning and adaptive management within research programmes. This is especially true in a research-for-development context where research competes with other worthy alternatives for overseas development assistance funding and where highly complex social, economic and ecological environments add to evaluation challenges. Researchers and research managers need to know whether and how their interventions are working to be able to adapt and improve their programmes as well as to be able to satisfy their funders. This paper presents a theory-based research evaluation approach that was developed and tested on four policy-relevant research activities: a long-term forest management research programme in the Congo Basin; a large research programme on forests and climate change; a multi-country research project on sustainable wetlands management, and; a research project of the furniture value chain in one district in Indonesia. The first used Contribution Analysis and the others used purpose-built outcome evaluation approaches that combined concepts and methods from several approaches. Each research evaluation began with documentation of a theory of change (ToC) that identified key actors, processes and results. Data collected through document reviews, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were analysed to test the ToCs against evidence of outcomes in the form of discourse, policy formulation and practice change. The approach proved valuable as a learning tool for researchers and research managers and it has facilitated communication with funders about actual and reasonable research contributions to change. Evaluations that employed a participatory approach with project scientists and partners noticeably supported team learning about past work and about possible adaptations for the future. In all four cases, the retrospective ToC development proved challenging and resulted in overly-simplistic ToCs. Further work is needed to draw on social scientific theories of knowledge translation and policy processes to develop and further test more sophisticated theories of change. This theory-based approach to research evaluation provides a valuable means of assessing research effectiveness (summative value) and supports learning and adaptation (formative value) at the project or programme scale. The approach is well suited to the research-for-development projects represented by the case studies, but it should be applicable to any research that aspires to have a societal impact.

1691,A multisectoral decomposition analysis of Beijing carbon emissions,"Beijing faces a serious problem of carbon emissions and the economic sectors are the main source of carbon emissions. Previous literatures have extensively focused on estimating the impact of carbon emissions of individual sector. Little attention has been paid to the multisectoral carbon emissions. In this paper, a multisectoral decomposition analysis was reported to explore the carbon emissions in Beijing. The emissions are decomposed into energy structure, energy intensity, economic structure (in industry), economic output, and population scale effects by the method of logarithmic mean Divisia index. Agricultural, industrial, construction, transportation, commercial, and other sectors are taken into consideration. The results show that population scale effect is the main factor for increasing carbon emissions in all sectors. The energy efficiency improvements are primarily responsible for the decrease in emissions in the industrial sector, while it increases emissions in construction, transportation, and commercial sectors. The economic output in agricultural and other sectors exerts a positive effect on emissions. In contrast, the energy structure effect only makes a minor contribution to the emission decrease in industrial, construction, commercial, and other sectors.",2017-03-01,10.1007/s10098-016-1249-1,"['Zhao, Litong', 'Zhao, Tao', 'Wang, Yanan']",Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10098-016-1249-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1692,Carbon and energy taxation for CO_2 mitigation: a CGE model of the Malaysia,"Malaysia has made a pledge to reduce voluntarily her carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO_2-e) gas emission’s intensity of gross domestic product by up to 40 % based on 2005 levels by 2020. The country is considering implementing economic instruments, among others, to assist the achievement of emission reduction targets while contributing towards the nation’s energy security and sustainable development goals. This paper develops a computable general equilibrium model with explicit energy-emission linkages to appraise the economy-wide and welfare impacts of carbon and energy tax policies to reduce CO_2 emissions in Malaysia. Results indicate that the negative macroeconomic impacts of carbon and energy taxes are small relative to the quantum of emission reduction. A Hicksian welfare criterion is utilized to determine the impact of revenue natural shifts in carbon and energy taxes. Revenue neutrality assumptions show that carbon taxation is the best choice when it can provide a double dividend if the generated revenue is used for the purpose of consumption subsidy on household purchases. The notion of the double dividend is confirmed when the change in the consumption structure will result in a welfare improvement, while CO_2 emission is decreased effectively. The study also found that carbon tax policy results in greater emission reductions relative to energy taxes, while the use of renewable energy will increase more substantially.",2017-02-01,10.1007/s10668-015-9725-z,"['Yahoo, Masoud', 'Othman, Jamal']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-015-9725-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1693,"Urban sprawl, public transport, and increasing CO_2 emissions: the case of Metro Manila, Philippines","Current international discussions on the increasingly critical levels of carbon emissions from the transportation sector commonly attribute the causality chain to urban sprawl growth–private car use–carbon emission. An often assumed development context of this causality chain is that common of developed country urbanization. However, in the particular context of developing country urbanization, urban sprawl and associated workplace–home distanciation may lead to more intensive use by the urban workforce of public mass transportation system, instead of higher dependence on private vehicle travel. Thus, the source of the rise in carbon emission may actually be the public transportation system. Utilizing mixed methods, combining quantitative (origin–destination matrices) and qualitative data gathering and analysis, the authors present a case study in Metro Manila which has been experiencing sprawl and increasing costs and unaffordability of land and housing in the workforce’s vicinity of employment. This, in turn, causes greater distances of daily travel between home and workplace using public transportation system. When the latter is characterized by fuel-inefficient small vehicles with second-hand engines, higher carbon emission results. We argue that the convergence of multiple interacting factors such as urban sprawl, lack of affordability of housing near the centres of employment, high dependence of commuters on public transports, longer distance travel by commuters, and low fuel efficiency of the public utility vehicles primarily causes the increase in CO_2 emission from the transport sector. Implications of this case to policy scoping of immediate and long-term state responses for carbon emission mitigation in transportation sector are discussed.",2017-02-01,10.1007/s10668-015-9729-8,"['Andong, Rebeca Fontanilla', 'Sajor, Edsel']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-015-9729-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1694,Emergy Analysis of Biogas-Linked Agricultural System,"This chapter provides an overview of the economic and environmental performance of biogas-linked agricultural system (BLAS) in China based on emergy. A set of emergy indices are incorporated to describe the energy and materials transformation within the system, and an emergy-based CO_2 emission indicator (EmCO_2) is proposed to achieve low-carbon optimization of the whole system. Emergy synthesis and emergetic ternary diagram are then utilized to evaluate the BLAS and its subsystems, with scenario analysis performed to identify a more sustainable development pathway for the BLAS. Finally, a framework is developed to track dynamical behaviors of the whole system (Level I), transforming process (Level II), and resource component (Level III) simultaneously, and two new indicators, emergy contribution rate (ECR) and emergy supply efficiency (ESE) are proposed to address the contribution and efficiency of resource components within each process. The results showed that BLAS made a favorable contribution to carbon mitigation and was more environment-friendly than the traditional agricultural systems. Scenario analysis demonstrated that continual biogas construction and effective technological revolution were preferable routes to further improve the whole system’s performance. It can be concluded that breeding and biogas subsystems were economic input-dependent. Electricity and diesels were the most efficient components in supplying all the processes in BLAS. The relatively high transformities and the constant descent of sustainability within all processes are the key problem that hinders the promotion of BLAS.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-662-55498-2_7,"['Chen, Bin', 'Hayat, Tasawar', 'Alsaedi, Ahmed']",Biogas Systems in China,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-662-55498-2_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1695,The Road to Paris,"To many extents, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change represents the culmination of a 25-year diplomatic debate involving a multitude of stakeholders, including policy makers, scholars, and a plethora of different interest groups. At the same time, the Paris Agreement embodies the foundation of a global transformation that can lead to the establishment of a low-carbon society and economy worldwide by the end of this century. Understanding how such utopic ambition has been codified and ratified in an international treaty and whether the treaty can trigger low-carbon transformation processes requires first of all an understanding of its history. By providing a summary of the key events that characterised the 25-year pathway that led to the Paris Agreement, this chapter offers the information required to understand the Agreement’s ambition. The description of the negotiation process since 1992 sheds light on the dramatic shifts of power that shaped its evolution.

1696,The Mitigation Alliance Target and Its Distribution,"Misalignment between the Paris Agreement (PA) objectives and its implementation tools represents the biggest challenge for its implementation. The compromise between top-down urgencies, such as the 2/1.5 °C target, and bottom-up stances, such as the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) pledge-and-review system removed years of efforts for identifying effective and equitable systems to combat climate change, threatening the same signification of the Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) principle. The Mitigation Alliance (MA) proposed in this book offers a feasible alternative to the current system. It applies to entities that voluntarily collaborate under the framework of the PA’s Article 6 (A6PA) and entails the establishment of an aggregate Net Zero Carbon (NZC) target for the MA and a technical, flexible distribution of the corresponding mitigation burden. While the NZC is based on scientific evidence, the hereby-proposed distribution system represents a key innovation. By introducing a dynamic formula for distributing the mitigation burden (or quota) among its members, the MA aligns ambition with the PA’s objectives while taking full account of the CBDR-RC principle.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-54699-5_5,"['Stua, Michele', 'Coulon, Michele']",From the Paris Agreement to a Low-Carbon Bretton Woods,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-54699-5_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1697,The Carbon Pricing and the Establishment of a Low Carbon Bretton Woods,"Financing carbon emission mitigation in line with the general objectives of the Paris Agreement probably represents the largest challenge to its implementation. Scholars and policy makers have identified carbon pricing as a possible solution to this challenge. However, several issues, such as carbon price instability and its excessively low prices, still need to be solved. When discussing the Mitigation Alliance (MA)’s approach to carbon pricing , in this chapter emphasises how it differs from the traditional approaches by shifting carbon pricing from a cost perspective based upon carbon emissions to a value perspective based upon carbon mitigation. Thanks to this approach, termed Positive Carbon Pricing (PCP), in this chapter demonstrates how the MA can effectively trigger a redirection of funding towards efforts necessary to meet the MA Net Zero Carbon (NZC) target. This process also represents the first benefit provided by the MA exclusively to its members. Specifically, the Chapter emphasises the role of Certified Mitigation Outcomes (CMO) in conferring effective value on documented mitigation. It is this value base which establishes CMO as the reference currency for carbon. Following on from the links between carbon as a commodity and CMO it is possible to theorise a MA monetary system that, due to its features, may be defined as Low Carbon Bretton Woods.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-54699-5_9,"['Stua, Michele']",From the Paris Agreement to a Low-Carbon Bretton Woods,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-54699-5_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer

1699,Climate Clubs and Their Relevance Within the Paris Agreement,"As diplomatic crisis threatened to overwhelm the negotiations for an international regime on climate change, certain new theoretical climate policy models began to gain a foothold in international debate. Hypotheses for smaller scale negotiations based upon a reduced number of actors, as well as the idea of ‘minilateral’ clubs of cooperating countries taking the lead in acting against climate change, quickly spread among scholars and policy makers, leading several commentators to view them as possible ‘last stance’ solutions in case the international climate negotiations failed. The Paris Agreement breakthrough, hailed by most as the ultimate victory of ‘multilateralism’, eventually overtook any minilateral ambition, at least concerning the climate bargaining process. Nevertheless, the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Paris Agreement’s ambitious objectives may represent a window of opportunity for a specific category of ‘minilateral’ models, known as ‘transformational clubs’, to find their own significant space within the new international climate regime. While describing the general characteristics of climate clubs and the specific features of ‘transformational clubs’, this Chapter discusses to what extent these latter may effectively play a role in the future developments of the international debate on climate change.",2017-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-54699-5_3,"['Stua, Michele']",From the Paris Agreement to a Low-Carbon Bretton Woods,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-54699-5_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1700,"Perspectives on Climate Change, Water and Land Use, Carbon Accumulation, and Effects on Ecosystem after Biofuel Implementation in India","Concerns over the increasing dependence on energy imports and growing emissions owing to demographic and economic factors have led India to adopt alternative forms of renewable and clean energy, especially biofuels. Though biofuel development provides opportunities for energy security and climate change mitigation, the cultivation of energy crops for biofuel has raised concerns due to the demand for fertilizers, pesticides, water, land, its possible impacts on ecosystems, and also rising food or fuel debate. This chapter tries to assess the implications that production and use of bioethanol and biodiesel have caused in India in the past decade through relevant studies. The greater focus that the current government and the IPCC have put on biofuels also demands that we understand both sides of these fuel resources before they are further expanded.

This research focuses on some product supply chain to make a literature review-based investigation on proposing a theoretical framework. We also solve potential research issues of how diverse carbon emission regulations can work on supply chain performance as well as emission; in what way we can find coordination mechanisms and optimal policies for supply chain operations to abate emission and enhance system profitability within different scenarios; and also to evaluate the effect on emission reduction for each emission regulation aforementioned through comparing their associated supply chain performances and system emission. Both practitioners in industry and academia might find this study useful, as it generates concepts with a formal framework of potential and values theoretical issues in the emerging field of carbon-efficient supply chain management which combines carbon emission regulations with mature operation management to enrich the theory of supply chain management.

1703,Implications of climate change damage for agriculture: sectoral evidence from Pakistan,"This paper gives a projection of the possible damage of climate change on the agriculture sector of Pakistan for the period 2012–2037, based on a dynamic approach, using an environment-related applied computable general equilibrium model (CGE). Climate damage projections depict an upward trend for the period of review and are found to be higher than the global average. Further, the damage to the agricultural sector exceeds that for the overall economy. By sector, climatic damage disproportionately affects the major and minor crops, livestock and fisheries. The largest losses following climate change, relative to the other agricultural sectors, are expected for livestock. The reason for this is the orthodox system of production for livestock, with a low adaptability to negative shocks of climate change. Overall, the findings reveal the high exposure of the agriculture sector to climate damage. In this regard, policymakers in Pakistan should take seriously the effects of climate change on agriculture and consider suitable technology to mitigate those damages.",2016-10-01,10.1007/s11356-016-7210-3,"['Ahmed, Adeel', 'Devadason, Evelyn S.', 'Al-Amin, Abul Quasem']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-016-7210-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1704,Exploring the changes of energy-related carbon intensity in China: an extended Divisia index decomposition,"To gain a better understanding of the changes in carbon intensity of China, this study firstly adopted logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition analysis to decompose the carbon intensity into three driving factors, including emission coefficient effect, energy intensity effect and industrial structure effect. Then, the analysis was furtherly conducted to study the contributions of four economic sectors to the percent change in carbon intensity through each influencing factor by attribution analysis. The results illustrated that the carbon intensity dropped by 46.21 % from 1996 to 2012 mainly caused by the decrease in energy intensity, of which the industrial sector, transportation sector and commercial & service sector were the dominant contributors. The emission coefficient effect and industrial structure effect were equally important in terms of increasing carbon intensity, which principally due to the industrial sector and commercial & service sector. In addition, the energy efficiency of agricultural sector should be furtherly improved, and it is imperative to optimize the energy mix and industrial structure of the industrial sector and commercial & service sector. Therefore, more differentiated policies are urgently required to be implemented in different economic sectors to mitigate the China’s carbon intensity.",2016-08-01,10.1007/s11069-016-2326-9,"['Wang, Juan', 'Zhao, Tao', 'Xu, Xianshuo', 'Zhang, Xiaohu']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-016-2326-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer

1707,India’s GHG Emission Reduction and Sustainable Development,"India has made voluntary commitment for reducing the emission intensity of GDP in the year 2020 by 20–25 % below that in the year 2005. The Indian approach is based on delineating and implementing cost-effective mitigation actions which can contribute to national sustainable development goals while remaining aligned to the UNFCCC’s expressed objective of keeping the average global surface temperature increase to below 2 °C over the preindustrial average. This chapter assesses three emission scenarios for India, spanning the period 2010–2050. The analysis is carried out using a bottom-up energy system model ANSWER-MARKAL, which is embedded within a soft-linked integrated model system (SLIMS). The central themes of the three scenario storylines and assumptions are as follows: first, a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario that assumes the socioeconomic development to happen along the conventional path that includes implementation of current and announced policies and their continuation dynamically into the future; second, a conventional low carbon scenario (CLCS) which assumes imposition, over the BAU scenario, of CO_2 emission price trajectory that is equivalent to achieving the global 2 °C target; and third, a sustainable scenario that assumes a number of sustainability-oriented policies and measures which are aimed to deliver national sustainable development goals and which in turn also deliver climate mitigation, resilience, and adaptation as co-benefits. The sustainable low carbon scenario (SLCS) also delivers same cumulative emissions from India, over the period 2010–2050, as the CLCS scenario using carbon price as well as a mix of sustainability-oriented policies and measures. The scenario analysis provides important information and insights for crafting future policies and actions that constitute an optimal roadmap of actions in India which can maximize net total benefits of carbon emissions mitigation and national sustainable development. A key contribution of the paper is the estimation of the net social value of carbon in India which is an important input for provisioning carbon finance for projects and programs as an integral part of financing NAMAs. The analysis in the paper will be useful for policymakers seeking to identify the CO_2 mitigation roadmap which can constitute an optimal mix of INDCs for India.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-981-287-826-7_3,"['Shukla, P.

It has not yet been addressed if biochar exerts synergy effects on crop production, GHG emission, and microbial activity in metal-polluted soils. In a field experiment, biochar was amended at sequential rates at 0, 10, 20, and 40 t ha^−1, respectively, in a cadmium- and lead-contaminated rice paddy from the Tai lake Plain, China, before rice cropping in 2010. Fluxes of soil carbon dioxide (CO_2), methane (CH_4), and nitrous oxide (N_2O) were monitored using a static chamber method during the whole rice growing season (WRGS) of 2011. BSA significantly reduced soil CaCl_2 extractable pool of Cd, and DTPA extractable pool of Cd and Pb. As compared to control, soil CO_2 emission under BSA was observed to have no change at 10 t ha^−1 but decreased by 16–24 % at 20 and 40 t ha^−1. In a similar trend, BSA at 20 and 40 t ha^−1 increased rice yield by 25–26 % and thus enhanced ecosystem CO_2 sequestration by 47–55 % over the control. Seasonal total N_2O emission was reduced by 7.1, 30.7, and 48.6 % under BSA at 10, 20, and 40 t ha^−1, respectively. Overall, a net reduction in greenhouse gas balance (NGHGB) by 53.9–62.8 % and in greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) by 14.3–28.6 % was observed following BSA at 20 and 40 t ha^−1.

1712,Decision Support Through Carbon Management Accounting—A Framework-Based Literature Review,"Purpose : Managing corporate carbon performance has seen a rapid development as a topic for the past decade. To effectively reduce corporate climate change impacts requires decisions on tracking and tracing of carbon emissions in a systematic manner. Yet, methods to manage information on corporate carbon performance have hardly been discussed in the extant literature. Whilst the global greenhouse gas emissions are further increasing, the total amount of corporate emissions has only decreased in some advanced companies. This raises the question of what decision situations a performance oriented carbon management accounting could support and in which areas research could be further developed to support carbon management efficiently and effectively. Method : A literature review was conducted to identify the current state of development of CMA. Relevant publications were analysed by means of taxonomic analysis. Findings : The analysis of academic CMA publications shows that the existing contributions on CMA methods only support few decision situations, still leaving many areas open for future research and practice. Implications : This chapter highlights the need for decision oriented research that enables CMA to fulfil its objective, i.e. to contribute to the efficient and effective reduction of carbon emissions.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-27718-9_2,"['Zvezdov, Dimitar', 'Schaltegger, Stefan']",Corporate Carbon and Climate Accounting,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-27718-9_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer

1714,The Role of Energy Service Demand in Carbon Mitigation: Combining Sector Analysis and China TIMES-ED Modelling,"China’s primary energy consumption increased from 1.46 btce (billion tons of coal equivalent) in 2000 to 3.25 btce in 2010, greatly influenced by energy service demand growth. For example, crude steel production rose from 152 to 637 million tons, urban per capita floor space from 10 to 21.5 square meters, passenger transport turnover from 1226 to 2789 billion passenger km (pkm), and freight transport turnover from 443 to 14,184 billion tons km (tkm). This trend in energy service demand will be a critical factor in the level of energy consumption and carbon emissions in the future. In this chapter, multiple approaches, including the stock-based model, the saturation model, the discrete choices model, and so on, are used to project energy service demands from different demand sectors. The projections of energy service demand are used as inputs in the China TIMES-ED model to generate a reference scenario. Several carbon constraint scenarios have been designed to analyze the role of energy service demand reductions in industry, building and transport in the mitigation of carbon emissions in China.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-16540-0_17,"['Chen, Wenying', 'Yin, Xiang', 'Zhang, Hongjun', 'Ma, Ding', 'Shi, Jincheng', 'Huang, Weilong', 'Li, Nan']",Informing Energy and Climate Policies Using Energy Systems Models,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-16540-0_17,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer

1716,"Forests, Forestry and Climate Change","Temperate and boreal forests represent substantial stocks of carbon as biomass and organic matter. Depending on the extent of climate change and the nature of future management practices, these forests may lose, retain or accumulate carbon in future decades. We review data on the impact of management on forest carbon, and we lay out some management options including longer rotations, lower disturbance, nitrogen fertilization and the afforestation of new land. We ask whether the carbon gains made possible by such practices will be at the expense of timber production and also we examine the impact of these practices on a range of environmental services (nature conservation, watershed protection, public amenity value, bio-fuel production). We look forward to a period of warming, which favours more rapid growth of trees in northern regions, but predictions from ecosystem models must be tempered by the likelihood that there may be more extremes, including droughts, storms and outbreaks of new pests and diseases.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-7076-8_11,"['Grace, J.', 'Morison, J.

1717,Quantifying the relationship between urban forms and carbon emissions using panel data analysis,"Carbon emissions are increasing in the world because of human activities associated with the energy consumptions for social and economic development. Thus, attention has been paid towards restraining the growth of carbon emissions and minimizing potential impact on the global climate. Currently there has also been increasing recognition that the urban forms, which refer to the spatial structure of urban land use as well as transport system within a metropolitan area, can have a wide variety of implications for the carbon emissions of a city. However, studies are limited in analyzing quantitatively the impacts of different urban forms on carbon emissions. In this study, we quantify the relationships between urban forms and carbon emissions for the panel of the four fastest-growing cities in China (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou) using time series data from 1990 to 2010. Firstly, the spatial distribution data of urban land use and transportation network in each city are obtained from the land use classification of remote sensing images and the digitization of transportation maps. Then, the urban forms are quantified using a series of spatial metrics which further used as explanatory variables in the estimation. Finally, we implement the panel data analysis to estimate the impacts of urban forms on carbon emission. The results show that, (1) in addition to the growth of urban areas that accelerate the carbon emissions, the increase of fragmentation or irregularity of urban forms could also result in more carbon emissions; (2) a compact development pattern of urban land would help reduce carbon emissions; (3) increases in the coupling degree between urban spatial structure and traffic organization can contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions; (4) urban development with a mononuclear pattern may accelerate carbon emissions. In order to reduce carbon emissions, urban forms in China should transform from the pattern of disperse, single-nuclei development to the pattern of compact, multiple-nuclei development.",2013-12-01,10.1007/s10980-013-9943-4,"['Ou, Jinpei', 'Liu, Xiaoping', 'Li, Xia', 'Chen, Yimin']",Landscape Ecology,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10980-013-9943-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer

1719,Linking Forests and Food Production in the REDD+ Context,"In order for REDD+ carbon emission mitigation targets to be reached, the primary driver of forest clearing globally—agriculture—must be fundamentally addressed by governments implementing REDD+ Programmes. This chapter evaluates the extent to which countries participating in the World Bank Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) readiness activities are actively linking REDD+ and agriculture policies, programmes, institutional and governance arrangements. Based on 20 current country readiness proposals (R-PPs) submitted to the FCPF, the analysis reveals that overall, REDD+ strategies and actions generally fail to address agricultural drivers. The paper poses a general roadmap for how countries can more adequately address agricultural drivers in their REDD+ strategies, including: identifying clear strategies to address demand-side and market pressures, and how government action can influence those; sorting out tenure and land access rights; strengthening cross-sectoral policies; linking mitigation to adaption; boosting efficiency and production of agricultural systems; and incorporating agricultural carbon measurement in national MRV systems.

1721,The agricultural ethics of biofuels: climate ethics and mitigation arguments,"Die Erforschung und Entwicklung von Biokraftstoffen war im letzten Jahrzehnt maßgeblich durch Umwelt- und Klimaschutzziele motiviert. Gleichwohl gerieten diese Ziele in den letzten Jahren zunehmend in Konflikt mit anderen Initiativen, die die breite Nutzung von Äthanol aus Ackerpflanzen propagierten. Letztere scheinen bei genauer Betrachtung den Emissionsminderungszielen zum Klimaschutz auf konzeptioneller, ethischer und politischer Ebene zu widersprechen oder den Zielen zumindest nicht förderlich zu sein. Vor diesem Hintergrund wird ein Trajektorien-Modell zur technischen Entwicklung von Biokraftstoffen vorgeschlagen, das die ethische Evaluierung entsprechender Forschungsstrategien erlaubt. Das Prinzip der Pfadanalyse wird derzeit auch in der Fachliteratur diskutiert. Das Konzept sieht sich dabei vor der Herausforderung, eine Vielzahl kritischer Elemente und Prozesse zu evaluieren, deren zukünftige Entwicklung und Folgen notwendigerweise unsicher sind. Im Fall der Biokraftstoffe hängen Entscheidungen für entsprechende Entwicklungen mehr von ihren Zukunftsperspektiven als vom derzeitigen Stand der Technik und deren Nebenfolgen ab. An environmental, climate mitigation rationale for research and development (R&D) on liquid transportation fuels derived from plants emerged among many scientists and engineers during the last decade. However, between 2006 and 2010, this climate ethic for pursuing biofuel became politically entangled and conceptually confused with rationales for encouraging greater use of plant-based ethanol that were both unconnected to climate ethics and potentially in conflict with the value-commitments providing a mitigation-oriented reason to promote and develop new and expanded sources of biofuel. I argue that the conceptual construct of technological trajectories provides a fecund approach to the ethical evaluation of R&D strategies in the case of plant-based liquid transportation fuels. The idea of a trajectory has a current use in the literature of science studies and aptly summarizes a number of themes that are critical to the evaluation of tools and techniques whose future shape, design, applications and potential consequences are necessarily somewhat speculative. In the case of biofuels, it is the imagined future trajectory that provides the basis for resistance to an emerging technology, rather than the present-day technical capabilities and the unexpected consequences of biofuel development. Pendant la décennie écoulée, l’exploration et la mise au point de biocarburants furent notamment dictées par les objectifs que l’on s’était proposés pour protéger l’environnement et lutter contre le réchauffement climatique. Toutefois, ces dernières années, ces objectifs se sont de plus en plus heurtés à d’autres initiatives propageant l’utilisation répandue d’éthanol extrait de fleurs des champs. Si on y regarde de plus près, ceux-ci semblent s’opposer, sur les niveaux conceptionnel, éthique et politique, aux objectifs de la réduction des émissions nocives dans la lutte contre le réchauffement climatique ou au moins ne pas être favorables à ceux-ci. Dans ce contexte, un modèle de trajectoires a été proposé pour la mise au point technique de biocarburants, permettant l’évaluation éthique de stratégies de recherche correspondantes. Le principe de l’analyse de chemin est actuellement aussi discuté dans la littérature spécialisée. Dans le cadre du projet, il faut donc procéder à l’évaluation d’une multitude d’éléments et de processus critiques dont la mise au point et les conséquences futures sont par définition aléatoires. Dans le cas des biocarburants, toute décision en faveur de telles mises au point dépend des perspectives d’avenir pronostiquées pour celles-ci plutôt que de l’état de la technique actuel et des effets accessoires qu’entraîne celui-ci.",2012-06-01,10.1007/s10202-012-0105-6,"['Thompson, Paul B.']",Poiesis & Praxis,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10202-012-0105-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1722,A modular framework for management of complexity in international forest-carbon policy,"Complex ecological and social settings make the programme on reducing emissions through avoided deforestation, forest degradation and other forestry activities in developing countries (also known as REDD) a challenging policy to design. Research shows the advantages of a modular policy framework able to distinguish, and adequately compensate, the different outcomes of any forest carbon initiative. Complex and variable ecological and social settings make the programme on reducing emissions through avoided deforestation, forest degradation and other forestry activities in developing countries (REDD+) a challenging policy to design. The total value to society of each type of REDD+ outcome is dependent on the fundamentally different risk profiles of alternative forest-management approaches and their scope and potential for co-benefits. We suggest a modular policy framework for REDD+ that distinguishes and differentially compensates the distinct outcomes. This could represent an improved framework to promote and manage incentives for effective forest-carbon initiatives, offer better scope to find common ground in policy negotiations and allow faster adaptation of policy to an uncertain future.",2012-03-01,10.1038/nclimate1376,"['Law, Elizabeth A.', 'Thomas, Sebastian', 'Meijaard, Erik', 'Dargusch, Paul J.', 'Wilson, Kerrie A.']",Nature Climate Change,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1376.pdf,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1723,Conclusions and Implications,"A methodological framework called Negotiation-coordination in Energy Environment Planning (NEEP) is systematically developed. The framework has been applied to the power systems of China to analyze two negotiation processes. Negotiation topics include power investments, power generation, electricity tariffs, and CO_2 emission mitigations and trading. Several conclusions and implications of the research are briefly summarized in this chapter. First, China’s reform from centralized planning mode to market economy oriented mode is a great success. Decentralization from socialism to socialism with Chinese characteristics in China’s reform is the key of the success. Integrative negotiations rather than government mandatory measures avoided major economic and social shocks that often lead to wastes of natural resources in a large scale and/or high inflations. China’s decentralized economic development system and investment mode has attracted a tremendous amount of capital from direct foreign investments, domestic companies, and their workers that have greatly contributed to China’s superior economic performance. Second, in energy-environment planning and policy research, many energy specialists now focus on the combination of macroeconomic model, energy demand model, energy supply model, and environment impact evaluation model, and so on. However, very few researchers have actually worked on the coordination process itself, taking into consideration of different actors on a quantitative basis within an energy system. This research fills the gap and to propose a methodological framework and some quantitative solutions to this problem. Third, this research indicates that China’s economic reform will continue over the next decades at least three areas: banking system, the oil and gas sector, and carbon trading. The methodological framework and negotiation simulations developed in this research will benefit the Chinese in these three areas.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4471-4057-3_6,"['Yang, Ming', 'Yang, Fan']",Negotiation in Decentralization,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-4057-3_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1724,Forest Fires in Mediterranean Countries: CO_2 Emissions and Mitigation Possibilities Through Prescribed Burning,"Forest fires are an integral part of the ecology of the Mediterranean Basin; however, fire incidence has increased dramatically during the past decades and fire is expected to become more prevalent in the future due to climate change. Fuel modification by prescribed burning reduces the spread and intensity potential of subsequent wildfires. We used the most recently published data to calculate the average annual wildfire CO_2 emissions in France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain following the IPCC guidelines. The effect of prescribed burning on emissions was calculated for four scenarios of prescribed burning effectiveness based on data from Portugal. Results show that prescribed burning could have a considerable effect on the carbon balance of the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector in Mediterranean countries. However, uncertainty in emission estimates remains large, and more accurate data is needed, especially regarding fuel load and fuel consumption in different vegetation types and fuel layers and the total area protected from wildfire per unit area treated by prescribed burning, i.e. the leverage of prescribed burning.",2011-09-01,10.1007/s00267-011-9681-9,"['Vilén, Terhi', 'Fernandes, Paulo M.']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-011-9681-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1725,Supporting greenhouse gas mitigation in developing cities: a synthesis of financial instruments,"One of the major concerns with the post-2012 global climate regime is to reach consensus on how to finance actions needed in fast-growing developing economies for significant greenhouses gases emissions mitigation. International financial and technology transfer are bound to bridge the gap under well-designed institutional framework to facilitate the transition to low(er) carbon development trajectories in developing countries. So far, cities, which contribute nearly 80% of global emissions, have not yet been recognised as a legitimate entity to implement different greenhouse gas mitigation policies and measures with relevant technical and financial abilities. Here we discuss the scope and scale of different climate-relevant financial mechanisms and describe their comparative advantages and weakness in financing climate resilient urban infrastructures (buildings and transport in particular). We show the limitations of current instruments available in scaling up necessary financial flows into developing cities to achieve the long term climate stabilisation targets. Lastly, the paper examines the feasibility of factoring the sector-wise and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA) mechanisms into local authorities’ long-term mitigation strategy by raising necessary funds to facilitate shifting the business as usual trajectories in developing cities in the next decades.",2011-08-01,10.1007/s11027-011-9288-8,"['Li, Jun']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-011-9288-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1726,Carbon Sequestration in the New Jersey Pine Barrens Under Different Scenarios of Fire Management,"The New Jersey Pine Barrens (NJPB) is the largest forested area along the northeastern coast of the United States. The NJPB are dominated by pine ( Pinus spp.) and oak ( Quercus spp.) stands that are fragmented and subject to frequent disturbance and forest management. Over long time periods (>50 years), the balance between oak and pine dominance is determined by fire frequency. As a consequence, the ability of the NJPB to sequester carbon may be contingent upon management activities as well as patterns of historic land use. We simulated 100 years of carbon change using three scenarios: (1) contemporary management as reflected in the recent (1991–2006) fire records, (2) an increase in the fire ignitions within the wildland urban interface areas of the NJPB reflecting increased prescribed fires, and (3) a longer response time to wildfires, reflecting a more liberal burning policy by the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. We used the LANDIS-II model coupled with CENTURY and the Dynamic Fire and Dynamic Biomass Fuels extensions to estimate forest carbon sequestration based on these three scenarios. Calibration and validation via comparison to monthly flux tower data indicated that the model reasonably captured the timing and magnitude of net ecosystem exchange in the absence of Gypsy moth defoliation ( r ^2 = 0.89). Under all scenarios, our simulations suggest that forests of the NJPB will continue to accumulate carbon over the next 100 years under current climatic conditions. Although aboveground net primary productivity, live carbon, and detrital carbon were roughly constant or increased only modestly, soil organic carbon continued to increase through time for all forest types except the highly xeric pine plains. Our simulated changes in management reflected only minor alterations to the fire regime and thus management may have only minor effects on total forest carbon budgets in the immediate future particularly when compared to recovery from historic disturbance patterns.",2011-07-12,10.1007/s10021-011-9462-6,"['Scheller, Robert M.', 'Van Tuyl, Steve', 'Clark, Kenneth L.', 'Hom, John', 'La Puma, Inga']",Ecosystems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10021-011-9462-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1727,Chapter 19 C_4 Species as Energy Crops,"The cultivation and utilisation of energy crops has the potential to provide, in the coming decades, part of the solution to the twin issues of substituting for fossil fuels and protection from damaging climate change by reducing carbon emissions. The ideal energy crop should have sustained capacity to capture and convert solar energy into harvestable biomass with maximal efficiency and with minimal inputs and environmental impacts. C_4 plants, and in particular rhizomatous perennial grasses (PRGs), have many of the characteristics of the ‘ideal’ energy crop. Herbaceous perennial species require far fewer energy and capital inputs than annual crops and they also sequester more carbon in the soil. C_4 photosynthesis also allows greater efficiencies in the conversion of solar energy to biomass energy, and of nitrogen and water use. Currently the most important feedstocks for biofuels are maize in the USA and sugarcane in Brazil, both C_4 species. In temperate climatic regions, where there is the greatest current demand for renewable energy, few naturally occurring species have C_4 photosynthesis. However, there are some notable exceptions, such as Miscanthus and switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum ), which show significant cold tolerance and are currently being developed as energy crops. The unusual features of the C_4 pathway in these species which appear to confer cold tolerance are reviewed. The recent drive to exploit the energy production and carbon emission mitigation potentials of C_4 energy crops has been controversial because of the anticipated competition for use of land for food or fuel. Despite this, the yield benefits provided by C_4 photosynthesis suggest that these species will make a significant contribution to bioenergy production over the near- and longer-terms.",2011-01-01,10.1007/978-90-481-9407-0_19,"['Jones, Michael B.']",C4 Photosynthesis and Related CO2 Concentrating Mechanisms,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-90-481-9407-0_19,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer

1730,Growing America’s fuel: an analysis of corn and cellulosic ethanol feasibility in the United States,"Recent excitement over ethanol in the United States has been unmatched by other alternative energy sources. To a certain extent, the mention of ethanol by President Bush in the past four State of the Union Addresses has politicized the debate and generated a high level of support for increased ethanol production in both Congress and the private sector. In December 2007, President Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which increased the renewable fuel standard that was mandated under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to 36 billion gallons by 2022. “Growing fuel” has appealed to politicians, the American public, and powerful agricultural interests all for different reasons. Whether or not the large-scale ethanol production and distribution of ethanol is efficient is not easily understood. Corn-based ethanol is so heavily subsidized through federal tax credits and even state credits that its true cost is hard to determine (Gardner in J Agric Food Ind Organ 5:4, 2007 ). The high corrosiveness of ethanol and its tendency to absorb water damages existing fuel infrastructure and requires special equipment and supply chains for transportation (Rusco and Walls in Biofuels, petroleum refining and the shipping of motor fuels. Institute for Advanced Policy Research, Technical Paper TP-05008, 2008 ). Perhaps, most importantly, the agricultural availability for energy crops is intertwined closely with food crops; corn prices are influenced by the converging demands of ethanol, feed crops and human consumption. After examining the feasibility of recent goals for alternative fuels in the context of corn and cellulosic ethanol production, we are unable to validate that corn-based ethanol is worthy of continued pursuit as a viable, comprehensive alternative to gasoline. On the other hand, we find the argument for cellulosic production more compelling due to the ubiquitous availability of amounts and variety of feedstock, combined with a high potential for far reaching and decentralized refineries. Our work indicates that a transition to advanced, cellulosic feedstocks for ethanol is absolutely necessary for increased biofuel production and reduced petroleum use to occur. However, in light of the lack of commercial availability of key components needed for cellulosic ethanol production, we conclude that the feasibility of cellulosic ethanol as a mainstream fuel will require many changes in technology and federal funding. Thus, we conclude that, in the short term, ethanol cannot meet the energy security and environmental goals of a gasoline alternative.",2010-08-01,10.1007/s10098-009-0234-3,"['Somma, Dan', 'Lobkowicz, Hope', 'Deason, Jonathan P.']",Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10098-009-0234-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1731,Carbon storage and sequestration potential of selected tree species in India,"A dynamic growth model (CO2FIX) was used for estimating the carbon sequestration potential of sal ( Shorea Robusta Gaertn. f.), Eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus Tereticornis Sm.), poplar ( Populus Deltoides Marsh), and teak ( Tectona Grandis Linn. f.) forests in India. The results indicate that long-term total carbon storage ranges from 101 to 156 Mg C ha^−1, with the largest carbon stock in the living biomass of long rotation sal forests (82 Mg C ha^−1). The net annual carbon sequestration rates were achieved for fast growing short rotation poplar (8 Mg C ha^−1 yr^−1) and Eucalyptus (6 Mg C ha^−1 yr^−1) plantations followed by moderate growing teak forests (2 Mg C ha^−1 yr^−1) and slow growing long rotation sal forests (1 Mg C ha^−1 yr^−1). Due to fast growth rate and adaptability to a range of environments, short rotation plantations, in addition to carbon storage rapidly produce biomass for energy and contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. We also used the model to evaluate the effect of changing rotation length and thinning regime on carbon stocks of forest ecosystem (trees + soil) and wood products, respectively for sal and teak forests. The carbon stock in soil and products was less sensitive than carbon stock of trees to the change in rotation length. Extending rotation length from the recommended 120 to 150 years increased the average carbon stock of forest ecosystem (trees + soil) by 12%. The net primary productivity was highest (3.7 Mg ha^−1 yr^−1) when a 60-year rotation length was applied but decreased with increasing rotation length (e.g., 1.7 Mg ha^−1 yr^−1) at 150 years. Goal of maximum carbon storage and production of more valuable saw logs can be achieved from longer rotation lengths. ‘No thinning’ has the largest biomass, but from an economical perspective, there will be no wood available from thinning operations to replace fossil fuel for bioenergy and to the pulp industry and such patches have high risks of forest fires, insects etc. Extended rotation lengths and reduced thinning intensity could enhance the long-term capacity of forest ecosystems to sequester carbon. While accounting for effects of climate change, a combination of bioenergy and carbon sequestration will be best to mitigation of CO_2 emission in the long term.",2010-06-01,10.1007/s11027-010-9230-5,"['Kaul, Meenakshi', 'Mohren, G.

1732,Quantifying the limits of HANPP and carbon emissions which prolong total species well-being,"Anthropogenic climate and land-use change are leading to irreversible losses of global biodiversity, upon which ecosystem functioning depends. Since total species' well-being depends on ecosystem goods and services, man must determine how much net primary productivity (NPP) may be appropriated and carbon emitted so as to not adversely impact this and future generations. In 2005, man ought to have only appropriated 9.72 Pg C of NPP, representing a factor 2.50, or 59.93%, reduction in human-appropriated NPP in that year. Concurrently, the carbon cycle would have been balanced with a factor 1.26, or 20.84%, reduction from 7.60 Gt C/year to 5.70 Gt C/year, representing a return to the 1986 levels. This limit is in keeping with the category III stabilization scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change. Projecting population growth to 2030 and its associated basic food requirements, the maximum HANPP remains at 9.74 ± 0.02 Pg C/year. This time-invariant HANPP may only provide for the current global population of 6.51 billion equitably at the current average consumption of 1.49 t C per capita, calling into question the sustainability of developing countries striving for high-consuming country levels of 5.85 t C per capita and its impacts on equitable resource distribution.",2010-04-01,10.1007/s10668-009-9190-7,"['Bishop, Justin D.

1734,Tropical peatland fires in Southeast Asia,"Extensive tropical peatlands are located in the Malaysian and Indonesian lowlands, particularly in Borneo, Sumatra, West Papua, and Peninsular Malaysia. In an undisturbed condition, these peatlands make a significant contribution to terrestrial carbon storage, both in terms of their aboveground biomass (peat swamp forest) and thick deposits of peat. Occasional forest fires, including peatland fires, have occurred in Southeast Asia over several millennia but, in recent years, they have become a more regular feature. The most severe fires have been linked with the El Niño phase of ENSO which causes extended periods of drought, particularly across the peatland areas of southern Sumatra and southern Kalimantan. During the last 20 years, rapid land use change, exacerbated by climatic variability, has led to an increase in fire frequency, as the remaining peat swamp forests come under pressure from increased illegal logging, development for plantations and agriculture-based settlement, and, where economic development has failed, land abandonment. A case study of fire occurrence in Borneo illustrates that peat swamp forests are much more prone to fire than any other forest type, largely as a result of the high pressure being put on these last remaining forested lands. From studies in central Kalimantan (southern Borneo), we demonstrate the relationships between peat drainage, vegetation change, and increased fire frequency, including the role that peat combustion and subsidence play in an increased incidence of surface flooding. Tropical peatland fires, and the changes in vegetation that they bring about, have significant impacts on the atmosphere, the carbon cycle, and various ecosystem services; they also cause wide-ranging social and economic impacts. Fires on peatlands usually affect both the surface vegetation and the underlying peat layer and, as a result, they release much larger amounts of C0_2 into the atmosphere than forest fires on mineral soils. In 1997, peatland fires in Indonesia resulted in the release of between 0.81 Gt and 2.57Gt of carbon into the atmosphere, equivalent to 13% to 40% of mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and over the last ten years a conservative estimate of total carbon emissions from peatland fires in Southeast Asia is of the order of 2Gt to 3Gt. Future climate changes may place further pressure on the tropical peatland ecosystem and are likely to lead to enhanced carbon emissions from both peat degradation and fire.",2009-01-01,10.1007/978-3-540-77381-8_9,"['Page, Susan', 'Hoscilo, Agata', 'Langner, Andreas', 'Tansey, Kevin', 'Siegert, Florian', 'Limin, Suwido', 'Rieley, Jack']",Tropical Fire Ecology,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-540-77381-8_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1735,"Community and farm forestry climate mitigation projects: case studies from Uttaranchal, India","The methodologies for forest mitigation projects still present challenges to project developers for fulfillment of criteria within the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) or other such mechanisms for the purpose of earning carbon credits. This paper systematically approaches the process of establishing carbon (C) stocks for baseline (BSL) and mitigation scenario (MSL) for two case studies i.e., community and farm forestry projects in Uttaranchal, India. The analysis of various interventions shows that both projects present high carbon mitigation potential. However, the C reversibility risk is lower in long-rotation pine and mixed species plantation on community lands. The project is financially viable though not highly lucrative but the carbon mitigation potential in this ‘restoration of degraded lands’ type of project is immense provided challenges in the initial phase are adequately overcome. C revenue is an essential driver for investors in community projects. The short-rotation timber species such as Eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus ), Poplar ( Populus ) have high internal rates of return (IRR) and high carbon benefit reversibility potential due to fluctuations in market prices of commodities produced. The land holdings are small and bundling is desired for projects to achieve economies of scale. The methodological concerns such as sampling intensities, monitoring methodologies, sharing of benefits with communities and bundling arrangements for projects need further research to make these projects viable.",2007-07-01,10.1007/s11027-006-9066-1,"['Hooda, N.', 'Gera, M.', 'Andrasko, K.', 'Sathaye, J.', 'Gupta, M.

1736,"Vulnerability of land systems to fire: Interactions among humans, climate, the atmosphere, and ecosystems","Fires are critical elements in the Earth System, linking climate, humans, and vegetation. With 200–500 Mha burnt annually, fire disturbs a greater area over a wider variety of biomes than any other natural disturbance. Fire ignition, propagation, and impacts depend on the interactions among climate, vegetation structure, and land use on local to regional scales. Therefore, fires and their effects on terrestrial ecosystems are highly sensitive to global change. Fires can cause dramatic changes in the structure and functioning of ecosystems. They have significant impacts on the atmosphere and biogeochemical cycles. By contributing significantly to greenhouse gas (e.g., with the release of 1.7–4.1 Pg of carbon per year) and aerosol emissions, and modifying surface properties, they affect not only vegetation but also climate. Fires also modify the provision of a variety of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, soil fertility, grazing value, biodiversity, and tourism, and can hence trigger land use change. Fires must therefore be included in global and regional assessments of vulnerability to global change. Fundamental understanding of vulnerability of land systems to fire is required to advise management and policy. Assessing regional vulnerabilities resulting from biophysical and human consequences of changed fire regimes under global change scenarios requires an integrated approach. Here we present a generic conceptual framework for such integrated, multidisciplinary studies. The framework is structured around three interacting (partially nested) subsystems whose contribute to vulnerability. The first subsystem describes the controls on fire regimes (exposure). A first feedback subsystem links fire regimes to atmospheric and climate dynamics within the Earth System (sensitivity), while the second feedback subsystem links changes in fire regimes to changes in the provision of ecological services and to their consequences for human systems (adaptability). We then briefly illustrate how the framework can be applied to two regional cases with contrasting ecological and human context: boreal forests of northern America and African savannahs.",2007-01-01,10.1007/s11027-006-9046-5,"['Lavorel, Sandra', 'Flannigan, Mike D.', 'Lambin, Eric F.', 'Scholes, Mary C.']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-006-9046-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1737,The POETICs of industrial carbon dioxide emissions in Japan: an urban and institutional extension of the IPAT identity,"Background This study applies the POETICs framework (population, organization, environment, technology, institutions and culture) to an analysis of industrial carbon dioxide emissions in Japanese cities. The inclusion of institutional variables in the form of International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives membership, ISO 14001 implementation, and non-profit sector activity addresses the ecological limitations of the often used IPAT (impact = population × affluence × technology) approach. Results Results suggest the weak existence of an environmental Kuznets curve, in which the wealthiest cities are reducing their emissions through increased efficiency. Significant institutional impacts are also found to hold in the predicted directions. Specifically, panel and cross-sectional regressions indicate that membership in the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives and non-profit organizational presence have negative effects on industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Conclusion The presence of institutional drivers at the city level provides empirical support for the POETICs rubric, which recasts the ecological framing of the IPAT identity in a more sociological mold. The results also indicate that Japanese civil society has a role to play in carbon mitigation. More refined studies need to take into consideration an expanded set of methods, drivers, and carbon budgets, as applied to a broader range of cases outside of Japan, to more accurately assess how civil society can bridge the issue of scale that separates local level policy concerns from global level climate dynamics.",2006-09-27,10.1186/1750-0680-1-11,"['Scholz, Stephan']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/1750-0680-1-11,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer

1739,Carbon Emissions Trading and Equity in International Agreements,"This paper explores the distributional consequences of alternative emissions trading schemes. It is argued that the distributional impact stems from the difference between two social welfare functions: the function which is implicitly maximised in a competitive market equilibrium and the function which is implicitly adopted when a given equity principle is chosen. An integrated assessment model is used to illustrate these findings, by simulating the introduction of various emissions trading schemes for the Kyoto protocol on the reduction of greenhouse emissions. It is shown that (1) changes produced on an equity index by the imposition of emission constraints (by country) may not be significantly higher than those obtained by the subsequent introduction of a market mechanism, and that (2) the various market regimes which could be adopted have quite different distributional implications.",2002-04-01,10.1023/A:1015218031905,"['Bosello, Francesco', 'Roson, Roberto']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1015218031905,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon emissions mitigation"")",springer
1740,The Role of Carbon Markets in the Paris Agreement: Mitigation and Development,"In its Article 6, the Paris Agreement foresees international cooperation and tasks it with mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, guaranteeing environmental integrity and assuring sustainable development. In its paragraphs, the same article provides for three different systems of international cooperation. The so-called market mechanisms or carbon markets could play a role in two of them. Article 6 makes it apparent that international cooperation and the use of markets are valid—but not exclusive—approaches in reconciling climate change and (sustainable) economic development. The question is how to align both through the operationalization of market systems. This paper provides first an overview of “carbon markets” within the body of the Paris Agreement. Then, it discusses why and how carbon markets reconcile climate change-related action with (sustainable) economic development. Third and lastly, the paper points at some safeguards in the operationalization of the international cooperation using markets as stipulated in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The most important safeguard regards to accounting principles.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-02662-2_6,"['Schneider, Henrique']",Climate Change and Global Development,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-02662-2_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions carbon market"")",springer
1741,The Science and Policy of the Verified Carbon Standard Methodology for Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration,"The restoration of tidal wetland and seagrass systems has the potential for significant greenhouse gas benefits, but project-level accounting procedures have not been available at an international scale. In this paper, we describe the Verified Carbon Standard Methodology for Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration, which provides greenhouse gas accounting procedures for marsh, mangrove, tidal forested wetland, and seagrasses systems across a diversity of geomorphic conditions and restoration techniques. We discuss and critique the essential science and policy elements of the methodology and underlying knowledge gaps. We developed a method for estimating mineral-protected (recalcitrant) allochthonous carbon in tidal wetland systems using field-collected soils data and literature-derived default values of the recalcitrant carbon that accompanies mineral deposition. We provided default values for methane emissions from polyhaline soils but did not provide default values for freshwater, oligohaline, and mesohaline soils due to high variability of emissions in these systems. Additional topics covered are soil carbon sequestration default values, soil carbon fate following erosion, avoided losses in organic and mineral soils, nitrous oxide emissions, soil profile sampling methods, sample size, prescribed fire, additionality, and leakage. Knowledge gaps that limit the application of the methodology include the estimation of CH_4 emissions from fresh and brackish tidal wetlands, lack of validation of our approach for the estimation of recalcitrant allochthonous carbon, understanding of carbon oxidation rates following drainage of mineral tidal wetland soils, estimation of the effects of prescribed fire on soil carbon stocks, and the analysis of additionality for projects outside of the USA.",2018-12-01,10.1007/s12237-018-0429-0,"['Needelman, Brian A.', 'Emmer, Igino M.', 'Emmett-Mattox, Stephen', 'Crooks, Stephen', 'Megonigal, J.

1742,Neoclassical realism and international climate change politics: moral imperative and political constraint in international climate finance,"In this article, I present a neoclassical realist theory of climate change politics that challenges the idea that cooperation on climate change is compelled alone by shared norms and interests emanating from the international level and questions if instead material factors also play a significant constraining role. Relative-gains concerns incited by the international resource transfers implicit in climate change policy may compel some states to be prudent in their international climate change efforts and conserve resources domestically for future contingencies, including their own adaptation and resiliency. Neoclassical realism recognises such systemic constraints while also identifying international and domestic factors — a ‘two-level game’ — that explain variation in state sensitivity to relative gains. As a preliminary test of this theory, I compare the latest data on the magnitude, distribution and financial ‘additionality’ of climate funds and carbon markets. Climate funds are found to be more vulnerable to systemic forces identified by neoclassical realism because they are largely drawn from existing official development assistance budgets despite international commitments that funds are ‘new and additional’. Carbon markets engage a relatively broader number of states and, contrary to moral hazard concerns, have been used to a greater degree by states reducing emissions domestically. While there are concerns about whether carbon credits represent genuine emission reductions, the effectiveness of climate funds is equally, if not more, dubious. I conclude that, while imperfect, carbon markets have too often been unfairly compared with an ideal climate finance mechanism that assumes few political constraints on international resource transfers for climate change.",2017-04-01,10.1057/jird.2013.5,"['Purdon, Mark']",Journal of International Relations and Development,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/jird.2013.5,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions carbon market"")",springer
1743,Conservation Agriculture and Soil Carbon Sequestration,"Changes to agricultural practices in response to climate change and widespread soil degradation are being investigated to improve food security, enhance environmental conservation, and achieve sustainability. Since soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration is a strong determinant of soil physicochemical and biological activities, carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural soils requires changes to management practices. Conservation agriculture (CA)—based on minimum soil disturbance, adequate surface cover, and complex crop rotations—has been proposed as an alternative system to conventional agriculture. This chapter reviews potential impacts of CA mainly on C sequestration, collates information on the influence of tillage, integrated nutrient management (INM), fertilizers, residue management and cover crops on SOC stocks, and deliberates on the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, economics, etc. by CA from existing case studies. Whether conversion to a CA system can increase C sequestration is not yet clear. More research is needed, particularly long-term research, to delineate ecological conditions suitable for adaptation in a CA system. Harshness of arid and semiarid climate exacerbates the risk of soil degradation by depleting SOC stock and increasing risks of erosion and salinization. Widespread adoption of CA can reduce the cost of farm operations including fuel consumption, while conserving soil water, improving soil functions, controlling erosion, and sustaining productivity.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-11620-4_19,"['Srinivasarao, Ch.', 'Lal, Rattan', 'Kundu, Sumanta', 'Thakur, Pravin B']",Conservation Agriculture,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-11620-4_19,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions carbon market"")",springer
1744,Carbon Capture and Storage: In the Quest for Clean Fossil Energy,"The main objective of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is to prevent CO_2 from entering the atmosphere by capturing CO_2 from large industrial sources and securely storing it in various carbon sinks. CCS is considered a critical component of the portfolio of carbon mitigation solutions, because global economy heavily relies and will continue to rely on fossil fuels in the foreseeable future. Currently, there are close to 300 active and planned CCS-related projects around the world—an indication of a growing commitment to this technological option. However, despite significant progress in CCS technology, the pace of CCS commercial deployment is rather slow. The major challenges facing the large-scale CCS deployment worldwide relate to a very high financial barrier and limited economic stimuli or regulatory drivers to encourage investments in the technology. This chapter highlights scientific and engineering progress in all three major stages of the CCS chain, CO_2 capture, transport, and storage, and the current status of existing and planned commercial CCS projects. Technological, economic, environmental, and societal aspects of the large-scale CCS deployment and its prospects as a major carbon abatement policy are analyzed in this chapter.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4939-0545-4_7,"['Muradov, Nazim']",Liberating Energy from Carbon: Introduction to Decarbonization,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-0545-4_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions carbon market"")",springer

Underlying Europe’s perceived leadership in the struggle against climate change is a proliferation of internal laws and regulations, including the largest environmental permit trading scheme in history. It would be erroneous, however, to assume that the emergence of this comprehensive policy landscape has followed an easy or straightforward path; more aptly, the development of climate and energy policy in the European Union has often been preceded by arduous negotiations and significant controversy.

1746,Exploring the Landscape of Climate Law and Scholarship: Two Emerging Trends,"Exploring the landscape of climate law, this chapter identifies two emerging trends increasingly visible in climate law scholarship. The first relates to the multi-layered nature of climate law. Here, the chapter argues that our understanding of the complex web of legal norms that address climate change necessitates research that also takes into consideration interactions between various sources of legal authority in regulating climate change, including their hierarchies, synergies and tensions. In addition to benefitting those implementing climate law on the ground, such an approach makes it possible to analyse the global implications of climate law, including its effectiveness and the mutual supportiveness of its various layers. The second relates to deformalization of climate law; the expanding role of non-state actors, soft law instruments and informal collaboration in global efforts to address climate change. While climate law scholarship is increasingly paying attention to this phenomenon, this chapter argues that accounting for the role of non-state actors and voluntary regulatory initiatives involves some important doctrinal challenges, including how to avoid becoming overtly descriptive and retain a normative focus.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5440-9_3,"['Kulovesi, Kati']",Climate Change and the Law,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5440-9_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions carbon market"")",springer

An introduction to the convoluted policy malaise surrounding the use of forests in regulated carbon markets is also presented. Whilst there are many opportunities and potential benefits of using forests to produce offsets, relatively few carbon forestry projects currently exist, particularly in regulated carbon markets. This seems due to financial, institutional and administrative obstacles, with prohibitive transaction costs often cited as the most prominent constraint to expanded carbon forestry development.

1750,Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration Enhances Rural Livelihoods in Dryland West Africa,"Declining agricultural productivity, land clearance and climate change are compounding the vulnerability of already marginal rural populations in West Africa. ‘Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration’ (FMNR) is an approach to arable land restoration and reforestation that seeks to reconcile sustained food production, conservation of soils, and protection of biodiversity. It involves selecting and protecting the most vigorous stems regrowing from live stumps of felled trees, pruning off all other stems, and pollarding the chosen stems to grow into straight trunks. Despite widespread enthusiasm and application of FMNR by environmental management and development projects, to date, no research has provided a measure of the aggregate livelihood impact of community adoption of FMNR. This paper places FMNR in the context of other agroforestry initiatives, then seeks to quantify the value of livelihood outcomes of FMNR. We review published and unpublished evidence about the impacts of FMNR, and present a new case study that addresses gaps in the evidence-base. The case study focuses on a FMNR project in the district of Talensi in the semi-arid Upper East Region in Ghana. The case study employs a social return on investment analysis, which identifies proxy financial values for non-economic as well as economic benefits. The results demonstrate income and agricultural benefits, but also show that asset creation, increased consumption of wild resources, health improvements, and psycho-social benefits created more value in FMNR-adopting households during the period of the study than increases in income and agricultural yields.",2015-06-01,10.1007/s00267-015-0469-1,"['Weston, Peter', 'Hong, Reaksmey', 'Kaboré, Carolyn', 'Kull, Christian A.']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-015-0469-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions offset market"")",springer

The cases include projects designed to provide different environmental services (clean water, carbon sequestration, biodiversity preservation, etc.) applying different public PES schemes as well as public private partnerships. The experience indicates that the lack of financial sustainability of PES projects is a major reason for the reversibility of environmental improvements once external funding stops. Long-term financial sustainability can however be achieved, if PES projects allow for the creation of markets for environmental goods driven by innovative local entrepreneurs.

We present evaluations of carbon stocks and biodiversity in pure and mixed native tree plantations in Costa Rica. To illustrate how monetary values can be assigned, we discuss a project that awarded PES to silvopastoral systems in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Colombia based on carbon stocks and biodiversity. PES can promote positive environmental attitudes in farmers. Currently this project is being scaled up in Colombia based on their positive experiences with PES as a tool to promote adoption.

1755,"The environmental sustainability effects of income, labour force, and tourism development in OECD countries","The impacts of the increasing human activities mostly through socio-economic and environment interactions have continued to generate more scientific studies and contemporary discussion on issues ranging from the climate change to income and gender gap. Accordingly, the current study employed the cointegration and a two-step (system) SYS-Generalized Method of Moments to examine the environmental sustainability effects of income, international tourism arrivals, and labour force vis-à-vis gender unemployment in the panel of (32) Organization for Economic Development and Corporation (OECD) for the period 1995–2016. The study revealed that income growth in the OECD countries and increase in the inflow of international tourists into the OECD member countries are significant endangering factors for the bloc’s environmental sustainability. More striking is the environmental impact of labour force in the panel countries. Intuitively, a positive labour force-environmental degradation nexus is expected; the negatively desirable labour force-environmental degradation nexus in the current study is a justification of (1) the prevailing gender employment/unemployment classifications in the OECD member countries, and (2) the increasing adoption of more environmental friendlier working conditions or operation among the member countries. Moreover, the current study strongly posits a significant policy framework for the governments and stakeholders of the OECD member countries.",2020-06-01,10.1007/s11356-020-08486-w,"['Lasisi, Taiwo T.', 'Alola, Andrew A.', 'Eluwole, Kayode K.', 'Ozturen, Ali', 'Alola, Uju V.']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-08486-w,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas carbon emissions"")",springer
1756,The nonlinear impact of industrial restructuring on economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions: a panel threshold regression approach,"Energy conservation, emission reduction, and sustainable development are the goals of achieving low-carbon economic development all over the world. Many countries are working hard to find measures, and industrial restructuring is considered to be an effective way to achieve economic development and emission reduction. However, previous studies have assumed that industrial restructuring and economic growth and emissions are simple linear relationships while neglecting nonlinear relationships. We use panel data from 32 countries from 1997 to 2017 and employ panel threshold models (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology model and Solow growth model) for empirical test. The results reveal that industrial restructuring has statistically significant nonlinear effects on economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions. With the process of industrialization and urbanization, industrial restructuring has a long-term positive impact on economic growth. The relationship among industrial restructuring and carbon dioxide emissions has been found to be inverted U–shaped. Industrial restructuring is beneficial to reducing emissions. The policy implies that although industrial restructuring is considered to be an effective measure to achieve green growth, for countries with different degrees of urbanization and economic development, industrial structure transformation should adopt different policies.",2020-04-01,10.1007/s11356-020-07778-5,"['Zhou, Anhua', 'Li, Jun']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-07778-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas carbon emissions"")",springer

1758,"Think big, start small: a good initiative to design green query optimizers","Recently scientists, politicians, students, associations and actors are sounded the alarm to save our planet. The slogan of Greta Thunberg “Our house is on fire” urges any person to act on the climate. As researchers in the field of databases, one of the most active research communities, we are compelled to propose little and big steps to save our planet. It should be noticed that DBMSs are one of the main energy consumers, as responsible to store and efficiently process data. In data stores, research on energy consumption has been mainly focused on some specific types of stores: data centers, database clusters, known as big infrastructures. These stores are computer warehouses dedicated to store and process in a parallel manner a large amount of data. They include different servers and network infrastructures. Energy consumption in traditional DBMSs got less attention compared to data centers, and at the same time, they are widely used in the actual applications. In DB-Engine ( https://db-engines.com/en/ranking ) ranking DBMSs according to their popularity, traditional DBMSs (Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, DB2) are the top 5 of the most popular systems. This motivates us to integrate energy consumption in the components of these DBMSs. Query optimizers are one of the energy consumer’s components. The actual studies were focused on integrating energy in query optimization in the mono-core processor architecture. Recently, thanks to multi-core, these studies have to be revisited. In this paper, we propose a new approach to integrate the energy dimension into query optimizers in the multi-core processor architecture. Firstly, we present a rich state of the art on energy consumption in the context of traditional databases. Secondly, a crossing from sequential query processing mode to parallel mode is given. Thirdly, we propose a cost model capturing energy in a multicore architecture. Its parameter values are obtained by using non-linear regression and neural network techniques. Finally, our cost model is integrated into the query optimizer in PostgreSQL on which several experiments were conducted showing the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposal.",2019-10-30,10.1007/s10586-019-03005-0,"['Dembele, Simon Pierre', 'Bellatreche, Ladjel', 'Ordonez, Carlos', 'Roukh, Amine']",Cluster Computing,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10586-019-03005-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas carbon emissions"")",springer
1759,Environmental Performance and Regulation Effect of China’s Atmospheric Pollutant Emissions: Evidence from “Three Regions and Ten Urban Agglomerations”,"This paper employs the slack-based measure method and an extended Luenberger productivity indicator to estimate and decompose the atmospheric environmental performance under the constraints of energy and atmospheric pollutant emissions [i.e., the growth of the atmospheric environment total factor productivity (AETFP)] of the “three regions and ten urban agglomerations” (TRTAs) in China. Specifically, undesirable output is considered as both carbon and air pollutant emissions, i.e., CO_2, SO_2, and NO_x emissions. Also, based on the proposed approach, we identify the different paths of the technical change as a crucial driver of the AETFP growth. Furthermore, using the spatial econometric model with a symmetric geographical distance weight matrix and an asymmetric economic geography weight matrix, we investigate the effect of different types of environmental regulation on the AETFP growth to verify the Porter hypothesis in China. The results show that the main drivers of China’s atmospheric environment inefficiency are air pollutant emissions (SO_2 and NO_x), carbon emissions, and fossil energy use. Spatially, the environment inefficiency presents a decreasing trend from northern China to southern China. The improved performance of SO_2 emissions made more contributions to the AETFP growth during China’s 11th “Five-Year Plan” period (2006–2010), while NO_x emissions has a marginal positive effect on the AETFP growth is marginal. Despite the differences in the technical change across regions, the technical progress offsets the negative impact of declining technical efficiency on the AETFP growth. Overall, energy-saving and emission-reduction policies and technologies in TRTAs exert a decisive influence on the AETFP growth. In particular, the spatial econometric results indicate that the market-motivated environmental regulation has a positive effect on the AETFP growth and thus conforms to the Porter hypothesis in China but does not cause the “race-to-the-bottom” effect among local governments, while the command-and-control oriented regulation leads to a “race-to-the-bottom” effect and undermines the AETFP growth.",2019-09-15,10.1007/s10640-018-00315-6,"['Miao, Zhuang', 'Baležentis, Tomas', 'Tian, Zhihua', 'Shao, Shuai', 'Geng, Yong', 'Wu, Rui']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-018-00315-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas carbon emissions"")",springer
1760,Evidence on Whether Banks Consider Carbon Risk in Their Lending Decisions,"Banks face a dilemma in choosing between maximising profits and facilitating the sustainable use of resources within a carbon-constrained future. This study provides empirical evidence on this dilemma, investigating whether a bank loan announcement for a firm with high carbon risk conveys information to investors about the firm’s carbon risk exposure collected through a bank’s pre-loan screening and ongoing monitoring. We use a sample of 120 bank loan announcements for ASX-listed firms over the period 2009–2015. We measure high (low) carbon risk exposure based on whether firms meet (do not meet) the reporting threshold of the NGER scheme. We document positive and significant excess loan announcement returns for loan renewals for high carbon risk firms, but not for loan initiations. Further, we document a more significant loan announcement return for renewals with favourable term revisions. Finally, we find no evidence that the market differentiates between domestic and foreign lenders. Taken together, our results suggest that investors perceive that banks incorporate carbon risk considerations into their lending decisions. Our results highlight the value of banks as financial intermediaries given the information asymmetry surrounding firms’ carbon risk exposure, and more generally the need to extend modern banking theory to consider issues such as the impact of banks’ CSR reputation on lending decisions.",2019-08-15,10.1007/s10551-017-3711-3,"['Herbohn, Kathleen', 'Gao, Ru', 'Clarkson, Peter']",Journal of Business Ethics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10551-017-3711-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas carbon emissions"")",springer
1761,"Connectivity, Attention and Risk","Ubiquitous connectivity, inspired by the Internet, has four meaningful effects in a STAR narrative: sharing, tsunami, attention and risk-taking. The first effect is captured by the sharing model, which is the creation and exchange of information, both personal and general. This contributes to the second effect, which is a content tsunami —an information overload. The third effect is an attention deficit and a loss of agency or cognitive apathy. Attention deficit arises from the content tsunami, while the loss of agency is fostered by abnegation of control to prediction machines. As a consequence, the fourth effect is mistrust, fear and diminished risk-taking , as scarcity of mind induces resistance to change and reluctance to adapt to rapid technological changes.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-21848-5_1,"['Bhatt, Swati']",The Attention Deficit,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-21848-5_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas carbon emissions"")",springer

In order to answer the question, one should consider that sustainability can only be real, if it coming from inside an organisation. A companies strategy is manifested in their value chain, ie. in the products that are created and the global supply chains, that are operated. The value chain is therefore the biggest lever for change towards a sustainable future. Sustainable value chain management syndicates the areas of CSR, product development and supply chain management into a coherent concept, that is able to create economic, ecologic and societal value.

1763,The use of “security” jargon in sustainable development discourse: evidence from UN Commission on Sustainable Development,"The premise of discourse theory in environmental policy is that realities are shaped by language. One discourse that is gaining popularity is the concept of environmental security, a discourse that presupposes environmental threats as urgent. The attempt to cast environmental issues as security issues has resulted in the common use of security jargon, idioms, and metaphors in policymakers’ and politicians’ statements. Various analyses attempt to identify why natural resources are discussed in terms and language of security. However, far fewer studies have attempted to identify differences in the manner in which different types of resources are incorporated into such a discourse by different actors and what variables contribute to this process. This study examines the construction of the security references, security arguments, and language in the statements of the Commission on Sustainable Development dealing with energy and water. We found that international organizations and Non-governmental Organizations were somewhat more likely than state actors to use security references to discuss sustainability issues. The issues securitized are not the traditional high political ones such as regime stability and conflicts, but rather issues more associated with human security, such as access to renewable energy, affordable food, and clean water. The fact that in many statements examined the use of security references was not associated with any existential threat and hence did not comply with the conditions of the Copenhagen School raises some doubts as to whether security language in these statements implies a true securitization move. We also examined whether the use of the term “security” by states was correlated with greater resource scarcity or vulnerability. In the case of water-related sessions, the evidence was mixed, depending on the choice of dependent variable. The results from energy security regressions, however, were inconsistent with the hypothesis that greater scarcity or vulnerability induces more use of security language.",2013-09-01,10.1007/s10784-012-9192-z,"['Fischhendler, Itay', 'Katz, David']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-012-9192-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas carbon emissions"")",springer
1764,Energy intensities and greenhouse gas emission mitigation in global agriculture,"Energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions are closely linked. This paper reviews agricultural options to reduce energy intensities and their impacts, discusses important accounting issues related to system boundaries, land scarcity, and measurement units and compares agricultural energy intensities and improvement potentials on an international level. Agricultural development in recent decades, while increasing yields, has led to lower average energy efficiencies when comparing the 1960s and the mid 1980s. In the two decades thereafter, energy intensities in developed countries increased, but with little impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Efficiency differences across countries in the year 2000 suggest a maximum improvement potential of 500 million tons of CO_2 annually. If only below average countries would increase their energy efficiency to average levels of the year 2000, the resulting emission reductions would be below 200 million tons of CO_2 annually.",2009-05-01,10.1007/s12053-008-9035-5,"['Schneider, Uwe A.', 'Smith, Pete']",Energy Efficiency,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12053-008-9035-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas carbon emissions"")",springer
1765,Indirect methods of large-scale forest biomass estimation,"Forest biomass and its change over time have been measured at both local and large scales, an example for the latter being forest greenhouse gas inventories. Currently used methodologies to obtain stock change estimates for large forest areas are mostly based on forest inventory information as well as various factors, referred to as biomass factors, or biomass equations, which transform diameter, height or volume data into biomass estimates. However, while forest inventories usually apply statistically sound sampling and can provide representative estimates for large forest areas, the biomass factors or equations used are, in most cases, not representative, because they are based on local studies. Moreover, their application is controversial due to the inconsistent or inappropriate use of definitions involved. There is no standardized terminology of the various factors, and the use of terms and definitions is often confusing. The present contribution aims at systematically summarizing the main types of biomass factors (BF) and biomass equations (BE) and providing guidance on how to proceed when selecting, developing and applying proper factors or equations to be used in forest biomass estimation. The contribution builds on the guidance given by the IPCC (Good practice guidance for land use, land-use change and forestry, 2003 ) and suggests that proper application and reporting of biomass factors and equations and transparent and consistent reporting of forest carbon inventories are needed in both scientific literature and the greenhouse gas inventory reports of countries.",2007-04-01,10.1007/s10342-006-0125-7,"['Somogyi, Z.', 'Cienciala, E.', 'Mäkipää, R.', 'Muukkonen, P.', 'Lehtonen, A.', 'Weiss, P.']",European Journal of Forest Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10342-006-0125-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas carbon emissions"")",springer
1766,Global Environmental Problems,"Everything that surrounds or affects an organism during its lifetime is collectively referred to as its environment. It comprises both living (biotic) and nonliving (abiotic) components. Human civilisation and globalisation are the dominant culprits of constant change in the global environment in present scenario. Various processes that can be said to contribute to the global environmental problems include pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain, depletion of natural resources, overpopulation, waste disposal, deforestation and loss of biodiversity. Almost all these processes are the result of the use of natural resources in unsustainable manner. These processes have highly negative impact on our environment. One of the major impacts is the release of large quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in atmosphere as the result of burning of fossil fuels by industries and automobiles. The result is the worldwide pollution problem, temperature fluctuation of our planet, ozone hole and possible change in Earth’s climate. Loss of forests, damage to water bodies (lakes and ponds) and their ecosystems by acid rain, over-exploitation of natural resources, massive extinction of species due to habitat destruction and other well-known causes worldwide are connected with environmental issues globally. The rapidly growing demographic structure and globalisation are leading to a number of environmental issues because of the uncontrolled urbanisation, industrialisation, deforestation and loss of useful agriculture land. The global environmental health impact remains profoundly perturbing. Unsafe water, poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, air pollution and global climate change accounts for nearly a tenth of deaths and disease burden worldwide. Due to above-mentioned environmental issues, our planet is facing severe environmental crisis.

1767,Do the performance and efficiency of China’s carbon emission trading market change over time?,"Whether or not China can succeed at the forefront of international development in the coming decades will largely hinge on its ability to adapt to low-carbon economic development and its efforts to promote the Unified National Emission Trading System (UNETS). To understand the evolution of China’s carbon market, this paper firstly divides the development of China’s regional carbon markets into three phases: pilot construction (phase 1, before 31 May 2015), preparation for the UNETS (phase 2, 1 June 2015–19 December 2017), and formal construction of the UNETS (phase 3, 20 December 2017–present). Then this research reviews the trading performance and employs four robust variance ratio (VR) tests to capture structural changes and examine the efficiency of China’s eight regional carbon markets in different periods. Results show that compared to phase 1, smaller price volatility, larger daily trading volume, and higher market liquidity are more frequent at the later stages of majority markets. Despite these improvements, results from the VR tests indicate that the statistic in majority of China’s regional carbon markets is insignificant in any given period and, therefore, they are not weak-form efficient. The additional detrended cross-correlation analysis demonstrates that market liquidity affects market efficiency in the Hubei market only, which implies that Hubei, where the market liquidity reaches almost 100% in phase 3, is highly likely to be weak-form efficient shortly. Finally, several recommendations are provided to improve the efficiency and maturity of China’s carbon markets, including strengthening legislation, improving the market design, and constructing information platforms.",2020-06-11,10.1007/s11356-020-09168-3,"['Zhang, Shiyi', 'Jiang, Kai', 'Wang, Lan', 'Bongers, Geoff', 'Hu, Guoping', 'Li, Jia']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-020-09168-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon market trade"")",springer

As the largest carbon market among the seven Chinese carbon-trading pilots, Guangdong is evaluated as the second-largest carbon market in the world, only being next to the European Union (EU). These pilots instigated enormous influence on the policy formulated towards the establishment of China’s national unified carbon market in 2017 with implications for solutions to environmental and climate problems on a national and even global level. This paper mainly adopts a comparative analysis approach, first to compare the liquidity of the Guangdong carbon market nowadays with a prior period and then with the Hubei carbon market. It further compares the influencing factors of carbon market liquidity based on the former results. The analysis identifies the factors influencing the low liquidity of the Guangdong carbon market, including the separation between the primary and secondary markets, insufficient openness in the secondary market, lack of adequate investors, inadequate consideration of the distribution and collection of emission allowances, an irrational carbon finance product structure, as well as a backward trading mechanism.

1769,Fuzzy criteria programming approach for optimising the TBL performance of closed loop supply chain network design problem,"Immense concern for sustainability and increasing stakeholders’ involvement has sparked tremendous interest towards designing optimal supply chain networks with significant economic, environmental, and social influence. Central to the idea, this study aims to design a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network for an Indian laptop manufacturer. The network configuration, which involves a manufacturer, suppliers, third party logistics providers (forward and reverse), retailers, customers and a non-government organisation (NGO), is modelled as a mixed integer linear programming problem with fuzzy goals of minimising environmental impact and maximising net profit and social impact, subject to fuzzy demand and capacity constraints. Profit is generated from the sale of primary and secondary laptops, earned tax credits, and revenue sharing with reverse logistics providers. The environmental implications are investigated by measuring the carbon emitted due to activities of manufacturing, assembling, dismantling, fabrication, and transportation. The social dimension is quantified in terms of the number of jobs created, training hours, community service hours, and donations to NGO. The novelty of the model rests on its quantification of the three triple bottom line (TBL) indicators and on its use of AHP–TOPSIS for modelling the multi-criteria perspectives of the stakeholders. Numerical weights for the triple lines of sustainability are utilized. Further, a fuzzy multi-objective programming approach that integrates fuzzy set theory with goal programming techniques is utilised to yield properly efficient solutions to the multi-objective problem and to provide a trade-off set for conflicting objectives. The significance of the CLSC model is empirically established as a decision support tool for improving the TBL performance of a particular Indian laptop manufacturer. Practical and theoretical implications are derived from the result analysis, and a generalised quantitative closed-loop model can be effectively adapted by other electronic manufacturers to increase their competitiveness, profitability, and to improve their TBL.",2019-02-15,10.1007/s10479-017-2701-2,"['Darbari, Jyoti Dhingra', 'Kannan, Devika', 'Agarwal, Vernika', 'Jha, P.

In particular, they are aiming to reduce their carbon footprint along their supply chain. In this context, substantial $$\hbox {CO}_{2}$$ CO 2 emissions reductions can be reached by horizontal cooperation, i.e. the collaboration of companies that work at the same level of the supply chain. In this paper, we evaluate these reductions using a location-inventory model which minimizes facility opening, transportation, cycle inventory, ordering and safety stock costs. To understand the impact of different market and partners characteristics on the $$\hbox {CO}_{2}$$ CO 2 emissions reductions, we compute a large set of numerical experiments, varying several key parameters (vehicles capacity, facility opening cost, inventory holding cost, order cost, demand variability and distances). Results show that horizontal cooperation reduces $$\hbox {CO}_{2}$$ CO 2 emissions by 16% on average. Moreover, horizontal cooperation is more effective in decreasing the carbon footprint of companies with low facility opening costs and low order costs, carrying expensive products (high unit holding cost) on a market with a high demand variability and a vast market area.",2019-01-07,10.1007/s10100-018-0599-7,"['Hacardiaux, Thomas', 'Tancrez, Jean-Sébastien']",Central European Journal of Operations Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10100-018-0599-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon market trade"")",springer

1773,Tactical supply chain planning for tyre remanufacturing considering carbon tax policy,"Greenhouse gas emissions are receiving greater concern in the world due to the recent Paris climate agreement with announcement of carbon emission targets by various countries to reduce anthropogenic global climate change. Industry and their supply chains are a major source of carbon emissions. Consequently, manufacturing firms have realized the importance of adopting environmental friendly supply chain management (SCM) practices and are implementing such plans in their business operations. The study presents a tyre remanufacturing supply chain tactical planning model that integrates economic and carbon emission objectives with a carbon tax policy consideration. A modified cross-entropy solution method was employed to solve the tyre remanufacturing tactical supply chain planning model with commercial solver. Numerical experiments are completed utilizing data from Indian tyre remanufacturing industry. The analysis of the numerical results give important organizational insights for industry practitioners and policy insights for the government on (1) possible financial and emissions reduction impacts of a carbon tax rate at the tyre remanufacturing supply chain tactical planning level, (2) the use of profit/emission objective trade off analysis for making informed decisions on investments in carbon emission reduction technology, and (3) possible way to decide carbon price for maximum environmental returns achieved without substantial impacts on the economy and competitive positioning of firms.

1775,An optimization study of a palm oil-based regional bio-energy supply chain under carbon pricing and trading policies,"Biomass residues due to their low bulk density typically require frequent transportation from biomass plantations in rural areas to conversion bio-energy power plants. This issue contrasts with environmental protection strategies, especially when power plants are facing different carbon reduction policies that enforce them to emit less than a given specific carbon amount. Although several researchers have investigated bio-energy supply chains concerning environmental policies, the majority of studies have been devoted to strategic decisions over a single planning period. This paper presents a multi-period bio-energy supply chain under carbon pricing (carbon tax) and carbon trading (cap-and-trade) policies at the tactical planning level. A mixed-integer linear programming model was adopted to optimize the proposed regional oil-palm biomass-to-bio-energy supply chain planning model. The numerical results indicate that when carbon pricing is in place when carbon tax increases linearly, carbon emissions’ reductions have a nonlinear trend, whereas both cost increase and carbon emissions’ reductions have a relatively upward trend in the carbon trading scheme. This paper also presents the sensitivity analysis of the proposed model regarding cost, emissions’ generation and supply chain performance. Finally, the paper recommends several significant practical implications and policy-making insights for managers and policymakers.",2018-01-01,10.1007/s10098-017-1461-7,"['Memari, Ashkan', 'Ahmad, Robiah', 'Abdul Rahim, Abd.

1776,Research on the initial allocation of carbon emission quotas: evidence from China,"In November 2015, China government announced that the national carbon emissions trading market is expected to start in 2017. Carbon emission trading system is a raising concern from day to day, in which the allocation of carbon quotas has the closest relationship with trading units directly determining the cost of carbon trading. Initial allowance allocation is fundamental, but it proposes difficulty in terms of the trading mechanism design. This paper is based on the total control principle of national layout, in which the government sets up the cap of emissions in the carbon emissions trading system and focuses on the historical emission allocation concept from the perspective of fairness and history responsibility meaning that the allocation of quota in the future is based on the historical emissions. Firstly, we carry out comparative analysis based on the economy development and the emissions of 31 provinces and cities in China and select the sign-post province, Hebei. Secondly, we take the sign-post province as benchmarking and compare the benchmarking with the other provinces on the economy to set three quota situations of different initial years. Finally, we conduct quota calculation of residual carbon dioxide of various provinces by the end of 2020 and provide the specific quota calculation plans under different situations. The result of quota indicates: Most provinces still have more or less surplus to reallocate by the end of 2020; some provinces and cities have developing economy at expense of large emission and old industrial area with high energy consumption and high coal demand are in the shortage of future emission space; for the developed areas, the earlier emissions accounting is not good for their owning surplus; the earlier the years we select as the starting to account the quota, the greater the reductions space we will have. Meanwhile, we carry out testing of the feasibility of self-providing quota plans. These results may provide corresponding policy advice for China.",2017-01-01,10.1007/s11069-016-2628-y,"['Hu, Yu-Jie', 'Han, Rong', 'Tang, Bao-Jun']",Natural Hazards,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-016-2628-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon market trade"")",springer

We start by presenting a generic framework and approach for sustainable SCN design and then we examine two particular cases in more details. The first one deals with the design of eco-efficient SCNs. We show how the SCN design models presented in previous chapters can be extended to take the environmental bottom line into account.

1778,Knowledge and the Climate Change Issue: An Exploratory Study of Cluster and Extra-Cluster Effects,"Climate change, while potentially impacting many industries, appears to have considerable significance to the wine industry. Yet little is known about how firms acquire knowledge and gain an understanding of climate change and its impacts. This study, exploratory in nature and studying firms from the wine-producing region of Tasmania, is one of the first in the management literature to use cluster theory to examine the climate change issue. Firms are predicted to exchange knowledge about climate change more readily with other firms internal to the sub-cluster than with those external to the sub-cluster. The hypothesis does not find support. The study also proposes that the different characteristics of knowledge can either increase or decrease their flows in and around clusters. Specifically, “public” knowledge about climate change is predicted to flow more freely than “private” knowledge about climate change. The hypothesis does not find support. Finally, firms are expected to acquire knowledge about climate change from sources other than cluster-entrenched firms, and in particular peak national industry bodies. The hypothesis finds partial support. A discussion of the findings is presented along with future research directions.",2014-11-01,10.1007/s10551-013-1901-1,"['Galbreath, Jeremy', 'Charles, David', 'Klass, Des']",Journal of Business Ethics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10551-013-1901-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon market trade"")",springer
1779,Robust design of a closed-loop supply chain network for uncertain carbon regulations and random product flows,"This paper addresses a multi-period capacitated closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network design problem subject to uncertainties in the demands and returns as well as the potential carbon emission regulations. Two promising regulatory policy settings are considered: namely, (a) a carbon cap and trade system, or (b) a tax on the amount of carbon emissions. A traditional CLSC network design model using stochastic programming is extended to integrate robust optimization to account for regulations of the carbon emissions caused by transportation. We propose a hybrid model to account for both regulatory policies and derive tractable robust counterparts under box and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets. Implications for network configuration, product allocation and transportation configuration are obtained via a detailed case study. We also present computational results that illustrate how the problem formulation under an ellipsoidal uncertainty set allows the decision maker to balance the trade-off between robustness and performance. The proposed method yields solutions that provide protection against the worst-case scenario without being too conservative.",2014-06-01,10.1007/s13676-014-0043-7,"['Gao, Nan', 'Ryan, Sarah M.']",EURO Journal on Transportation and Logistics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13676-014-0043-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon market trade"")",springer
1780,Inventory Routing Problem with CO_2 Emissions Consideration,"Greenhouse gases emission is a major concern globally since they are key players in global warming. Some countries have signed the Kyoto Protocol, and set up some regulations to reduce their CO_2 emissions. Optimizing inventory and routing decisions can help in the reduction of CO_2 emissions if these emissions are taken into account by the decision makers. In the formulation, CO_2 emitted by transporting the product is modeled. The chapter investigates the effect of CO_2 emissions on the inventory and routing decisions determined over a given time horizon. The model is coded and solved in GAMS. The test results are used to indicate that emission costs should be considered when deciding the routing and inventory decisions.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-07287-6_44,"['Alkawaleet, Nasir', 'Hsieh, Yi-Fang', 'Wang, Yanxiang']","Logistics Operations, Supply Chain Management and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-07287-6_44,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon market trade"")",springer
1781,A Market Like No Other,"History may well judge the Bank’s role in subsidizing global carbon markets as an ill-advised and quixotic foray into the early-twenty-first-century equivalent of the seventeenth-century speculative bubble in tulip-bulb futures. Here the seductive lure was not to purchase a whole house in Amsterdam for the price of a single rare tulip bulb (as was the case at the peak of the infamous Dutch financial bubble in tulip futures), but to unleash a global carbon market whereby businesses in developed countries would pay tens of billions of dollars a year for activities in poorer countries to offset rich-country greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. Superficially, it seemed plausible enough; after all, major industrialized country governments were pushing the scheme, and they gave the Bank still more money to help catalyze it.",2013-01-01,10.5822/978-1-61091-184-9_9,"['Rich, Bruce']",Foreclosing the Future,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.5822/978-1-61091-184-9_9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon market trade"")",springer
1782,Economics of Multiple Forest Values and Life Cycle Analysis,"As climate mitigation efforts transform the value of carbon with institutions creating incentives as well as regulating markets, avoiding unintended consequences becomes challenging. Life Cycle Inventory and Analysis (LCI/LCA) research tracks carbon and other services from the forest to products including displacement of fossil emissions when wood substitutes for fossil fuels or fossil intensive products. Incentives that do not target uses that displace the most emissions will likely steal the feedstock from less effective uses, increasing rather than decreasing emissions. We apply life cycle research to identify leverage points in reducing carbon emissions and their impact on old forest habitat as the ecosystem value most likely threatened by carbon mitigation incentives. Ethanol subsidies, forest carbon credits, and renewable energy standards steal the feedstock from higher leverage uses, while a carbon tax effectively penalizes the largest emitters. Either carbon taxes or incentives will affect the cost of sustaining critical habitat. Institutions need to consider life cycle implications to sustain forests and their multiple values. While a carbon tax provides the proper price signal with the highest reward for the greatest carbon emission reduction, increasing habitat values may be justified to support the production, maintenance and restoration of important habitat.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5778-3_10,"['Lippke, Bruce', 'Oneil, Elaine', 'Zobrist, Kevin']",Post-Faustmann Forest Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5778-3_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon market trade"")",springer
1783,Obstacles for CCS deployment: an analysis of discrepancies of perceptions,"The potential for CO_2 emission reductions through carbon capture and storage (CCS) is depending on investments that can bring the technology from the current R&D through to commercial applications. The intermediate step in this development is demonstration plants that can prove the technical, economic, social, and ecological feasibility of CCS technologies. Based on a CCS stakeholder questionnaire survey and a literature review, we critically analyse discrepancies regarding perceptions of deployment obstacles and experiences from early demonstration plants. The analysis identifies discrepancies between CCS policies versus important deployment considerations and CCS stakeholder policy demands. The discrepancy gap is emphasised by lessons from restructured, postponed, and cancelled CCS projects. To bridge this cognitive gap towards proving CCS through demonstration activities, the article highlights policy implications of establishing a broad understanding of deployment obstacles. Attention to these obstacles is important for policymakers and industry in channelling efforts to demonstrating CCS, hence validating the current focus on CCS as a key abatement potential. Under present conditions, the findings question the robustness of current CCS abatement potential estimates and deployment goals as established by policymakers and in scenarios.",2012-08-01,10.1007/s11027-011-9353-3,"['Stigson, Peter', 'Hansson, Anders', 'Lind, Mårten']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-011-9353-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon market trade"")",springer
1784,Mitigating methane emissions from livestock: a global analysis of sectoral policies,"Methane emissions from livestock enteric fermentation and manure management represent about 40% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector and are projected to increase substantially in the coming decades, with most of the growth occurring in non-Annex 1 countries. To mitigate livestock methane, incentive policies based on producer-level emissions are generally not feasible because of high administrative costs and producer transaction costs. In contrast, incentive policies based on sectoral emissions are likely administratively feasible, even in developing countries. This study uses an economic model of global agriculture to estimate the effects of two sectoral mitigation policies: a carbon tax and an emissions trading scheme based on average national methane emissions per unit of commodity. The analysis shows how the composition and location of livestock production and emissions change in response to the policies. Results illustrate the importance of global mitigation efforts: when policies are limited to Annex 1 countries, increased methane emissions in non-Annex 1 countries offset approximately two-thirds of Annex 1 emissions reductions. While non-Annex 1 countries face substantial disincentives to enacting domestic carbon taxes, developing countries could benefit from participating in a global sectoral emissions trading scheme. We illustrate one scheme in which non-Annex 1 countries collectively earn USD 2.4 billion annually from methane emission permit sales when methane is priced at USD 30/t CO_2-eq.",2012-05-01,10.1007/s10584-011-0206-6,"['Key, Nigel', 'Tallard, Gregoire']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-011-0206-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon market trade"")",springer
1785,Emissions Trading,"Climate change is being exacerbated by the emissions of globe-warming greenhouse gases (GHGs) as a consequence of economic activities associated with energy, industry, transportation, and land use. From an economic viewpoint, the Earth’s climate is a public good , and pollution a negative externality ; such change therefore constitutes market failure . Controlling air pollution by utilizing economic mechanisms represents an important change in environmental thinking – literally a paradigm shift away from historical command-and-control (CAC) engineering systems. Today, this new approach is being utilized to mitigate the emissions of GHGs, addressing the pollution externality by putting a price on carbon. The international carbon market, largely developed as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, had a total value of $144 billion in 2009. The largest component of that market, the European Union’s Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), was worth $118 billion; it represents a regional market designed to assist Europe in achieving compliance with the Protocol’s requirements, and also has links to the Protocol’s project-based mechanisms, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI) which help minimize compliance costs. These project-based components themselves were valued at $2.7 billion and $354 million, respectively. Further, other carbon markets created in numerous countries (e.g., the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative [RGGI] in the USA and the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme in New South Wales, Australia) were worth $2.3 billion, while the global voluntary market was estimated to be in the $350–$400 million range (a significant drop from the previous year’s $700 million figure).

1786,Climate business for poverty reduction? The role of the World Bank,"The World Bank is increasingly active in the area of climate change mitigation. While it justifies this engagement with its poverty reduction objective and its capacity to pave the way for new business activities in developing countries, critics blame the World Bank as a “climate profiteer” and as an unfair competitor in private markets. Our econometric analysis of over 2,000 projects registered until May 2010 under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol allows us to compare the activities of the Bank with those of other, primarily private actors. The results indicate that hardly any of the CDM projects can be considered as strongly pro-poor. Nevertheless, in comparison to the rest of the CDM projects, the Bank’s portfolio shows a relatively clearer orientation towards poor countries. Within these countries, however, the Bank does not show any particular pro-poor focus, and tends to implement those projects that are commercially most attractive. Moreover, there is no evidence of the Bank phasing out its activities once the market becomes fully operational, which goes against its professed pioneering and catalytic role in carbon markets.",2011-09-01,10.1007/s11558-011-9103-z,"['Michaelowa, Axel', 'Michaelowa, Katharina']",The Review of International Organizations,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11558-011-9103-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon market trade"")",springer

An introduction to the convoluted policy malaise surrounding the use of forests in regulated carbon markets is also presented. Whilst there are many opportunities and potential benefits of using forests to produce offsets, relatively few carbon forestry projects currently exist, particularly in regulated carbon markets. This seems due to financial, institutional and administrative obstacles, with prohibitive transaction costs often cited as the most prominent constraint to expanded carbon forestry development. The papers in this special issue present a wide coverage of carbon forestry development policy issues. The special issue provides a unique insight into the state of carbon forestry globally and highlights the pressing need for policy and market reform to facilitate more sustainable carbon forestry development.",2010-12-01,10.1007/s11842-010-9142-y,"['Dargusch, P.', 'Harrison, S.', 'Thomas, S.']",Small-scale Forestry,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11842-010-9142-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon market trade"")",springer

1791,Africa and the global carbon cycle,"The African continent has a large and growing role in the global carbon cycle, with potentially important climate change implications. However, the sparse observation network in and around the African continent means that Africa is one of the weakest links in our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Here, we combine data from regional and global inventories as well as forward and inverse model analyses to appraise what is known about Africa's continental-scale carbon dynamics. With low fossil emissions and productivity that largely compensates respiration, land conversion is Africa's primary net carbon release, much of it through burning of forests. Savanna fire emissions, though large, represent a short-term source that is offset by ensuing regrowth. While current data suggest a near zero decadal-scale carbon balance, interannual climate fluctuations (especially drought) induce sizeable variability in net ecosystem productivity and savanna fire emissions such that Africa is a major source of interannual variability in global atmospheric CO_2. Considering the continent's sizeable carbon stocks, their seemingly high vulnerability to anticipated climate and land use change, as well as growing populations and industrialization, Africa's carbon emissions and their interannual variability are likely to undergo substantial increases through the 21st century.",2007-03-07,10.1186/1750-0680-2-3,"['Williams, Christopher A', 'Hanan, Niall P', 'Neff, Jason C', 'Scholes, Robert J', 'Berry, Joseph A', 'Denning, A Scott', 'Baker, David F']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/1750-0680-2-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions mitigation trade"")",springer
1792,Multilevel Analysis and Comparison of Climate Change Policies in Argentina and Canada,"Purpose – This chapter discusses and compares the climate change policies of Argentina and Canada at the international, national, and local level. Starting with a discussion of both Argentina and Canada’s positions in the UNFCCC, the chapter then explains the positions and policies that have been implemented in the national and then local level of each country. Methodology/approach – This chapter is an analysis and comparison of laws, policies, and practices through not only a discursive analysis of their official positive legal meaning but also through an analysis of their actual applied impact. A multilevel institutional analysis is utilized such that the climate change policies of Argentina and Canada are analyzed at the international, national, and local level. Findings – At the international level, a discourse surrounds Argentina and Canada in terms of developing and developed country and global justice. At the national level, each country has different official laws and discourses surrounding climate change; however, at the regional level in both countries, many similarities exist in respect of climate change mitigation and adaptation in both positivistic legal meaning and actual applied reality. This chapter hypothesizes that a problematic gap exists between the climate change institutional framework and the “real” climate change being experienced by local people. Practical implications – The similarities in the actual applied experience of climate change mitigation and adaptation in Argentina (a developing country) and Canada (a developed country) at the regional level, contrasted with the different characteristics at the national and international level, offer insights into the challenge of effective implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Originality/value – The multilevel institutional analysis and comparison of Argentina and Canada in respect of climate change mitigation and adaptation reveal significant structural governance challenges for the effective implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation goals of the UNFCCC.

1794,Evolving Integrated Models From Narrower Economic Tools: the Example of Forest Sector Models,"Integrated simulation models are commonly used to provide insight on the complex functioning of social-ecological systems, often drawing on earlier tools with a narrower focus. Forest sector models (FSM) encompass a set of simulation models originally developed to forecast economic developments in timber markets but now commonly used to analyse climate and environmental policy. In this paper, we document and investigate this evolution through the prism of the inclusion of several non-timber objectives into FSM. We perform a systematic, quantitative survey of the literature followed by a more in-depth narrative review. Results show that a majority of papers in FSM research today focuses on non-timber objectives related to climate change mitigation, namely carbon sequestration and bioenergy production. Habitat conservation, deforestation and the mitigation of disturbances are secondary foci, while aspects such as forest recreation and many regulation services are absent. Non-timber objectives closest to the original targets of FSM, as well as those for which economic values are easier to estimate, have been more deeply integrated to the models, entering the objective function as decision variables. Others objectives are usually modelled as constraints and only considered through their negative economic impacts on the forest sector. Current limits to a deeper inclusion of non-timber objectives include the models’ ability to represent local environmental conditions as well as the formulation of the optimisation problem as a maximisation of economic welfare. Recent research has turned towards the use of model couplings and the development of models at the local scale to overcome these limitations. Challenges for future research comprise extensions to other non-timber objectives, especially cultural services, as well as model calibration at lower spatial scales.",2020-08-01,10.1007/s10666-020-09706-w,"['Riviere, Miguel', 'Caurla, Sylvain', 'Delacote, Philippe']",Environmental Modeling & Assessment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10666-020-09706-w,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1795,Improving Truthful Reporting of Polluting Firms by Rotating Inspectors: Experimental Evidence from a Bribery Game,"We consider a two-layered review system of environmental regulation where a polluting firm periodically self-reports its emissions to a regulatory authority. The system typically requires a third party to verify the firm’s report and, in addition, an official of the regulatory authority to spot-check. If there are potential gains from corruption, both the verifier and the official might be corruptible. Corruption is more likely in repeated-game situations, as suggested by the literature on corruption experiments. Our experimental design is motivated by the risk of under-reporting in emissions trading schemes where both the verifier and the official are corruptible and focuses on a situation with untruthful reporting and lax enforcement. Our test-bed is a three-player bribery game. We study how different types of rotation—a baseline of fixed matching, a complete rotation treatment, and two incomplete rotation treatments—affect untruthful reporting that requires collusion between three participants in a hierarchical structure. Our findings suggest that complete rotation improves significantly firms’ truthful reporting and verifiers’ truthful verification compared to situations where none is rotated, while incomplete rotation does not have such impact. In our experiment, none of the rotation treatments had a significant impact on the behavior of officials.",2020-07-01,10.1007/s10640-020-00417-0,"['Shen, Peiyao', 'Betz, Regina', 'Ortmann, Andreas', 'Gong, Rukai']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-020-00417-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1796,Carbon price interaction between allocated permits and generated offsets,"The Kyoto Protocol established targets for curbing greenhouse gas emissions in order to mitigate climate change, and it introduced two kinds of market-based mechanisms: the emission allowance market and the carbon offset market. We identify stylized features of the two mechanisms with a partial equilibrium model. Our work is the first to derive a closed form solution incorporating most policy instruments, such as abatement and offset usage, and delivery risks in offsets. We show that policy changes will impact one market directly and the other indirectly, generating unequal price responses that affects the spread between the two compliance instruments. We show how the price spread between allowances and offsets is affected by market conditions such as the offset import limit, abatement and offset cost, penalty rate, emission cap, and baseline emissions.",2020-06-01,10.1007/s12351-017-0345-2,"['Yu, Jongmin', 'Mallory, Mindy L.']",Operational Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12351-017-0345-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

The three points of engagement—(1) baseline determinations, (2) the calculation of additionality, and (3) the role of uncertainty—are used to show how processes framed as technical are often spaces where uneven social and political interests are manipulated or obscured and contribute to varying environmental and conservation outcomes. The article begins by reviewing how carbon counting emerges in critical social science literature on forest carbon projects. Next, it explains carbon accounting broadly, the specifics of forest carbon accounting and why forests are popular spaces for financialized carbon sequestration. It concludes by arguing that carbon accounting is an uneven technical and political process that makes multiples forms of carbon legible on financial markets but does little to physically address atmospheric carbon concentrations.",2020-01-20,10.1007/s10584-020-02653-1,"['Gifford, Lauren']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-020-02653-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1798,Market-induced carbon leakage in China’s certified emission reduction projects,"The topic of climate change has aroused increasingly widespread concern around the world. Under the agreement at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), covened in Paris, France (Paris Agreement), which requires all Parties to undertake emission reductions, the developing countries who were once exempted from emission reduction obligations are now becoming more and more important. This study focuses on mitigation actions in China, the largest carbon emitter, as well as the largest developing country in the world. Specifically, we examine Chinese Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) projects. The objective is to compare the reduction efficiency of three types of projects: simple abatement and completely renewable energy alternative projects at the supply side and demand side projects. From market-induced carbon leakage point of view, a dual market equilibrium model was built, with results showing that the key factors affecting the leakage rates are price elasticities of both demand and supply sides and market share parameters. In most cases, renewable energy alternative projects show the least leakage rate while demand side projects show the highest. Sensitivity analysis finds that leakage rates for the three types of projects are more sensitive to price elasticity parameters than market share parameters. Moreover, factors E c de $$ {E}_c^{de} $$ (electricity price elasticity of coal demand from coal-fired generation) and E e d $$ {E}_e^d $$ (electricity price elasticity of electricity demand) affect not only the leakage rate of each project but also the comparative results between them. Although our study is based on China, the theoretical analysis is applicable in other regional voluntary emission reduction markets around the world. So, a systematic approach to comprehensively analyze the issue is summarized, based on which, we recommend two mitigation strategies to cope with the issue in offset projects in order to give managerial insights for the government. Firstly, the calculated leakage rates for different types of projects provide a new perspective to evaluate various offset projects, thus helping consider project types for priority validation. Secondly, we suggest to establish an accurate and classified discount coefficient system according to the project types to deal with the issue; the sensitivity analysis is helpful to find the most influential factors. A top-down approach to implement the strategy is proposed.",2020-01-04,10.1007/s11027-019-09904-2,"['Ye, Huiying', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Pan, Xunzhang', 'Farnoosh, Arash']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-019-09904-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1799,Private Ancillary Benefits in a Joint Production Framework,"This chapter focuses on private ancillary benefits from climate protection activities and their potential to work as motivating factors for individuals and their climate-friendly activities and support of climate policies. In contrast to the primary benefits on the climate, private ancillary benefits appear to be more attractive to the individual as they directly increase their utility in the short run and are associated with less uncertainty. We discuss existing empirical literature on financial advantages, internal satisfaction, health benefits, and fairness as secondary benefits. We do not come to a clear conclusion and recommendation whether actors from the public and private sector should lay more emphasis on the secondary private benefits when promoting climate protection measures.

1802,Optimizing sequestered carbon in forest offset programs: balancing accounting stringency and participation,"Background Although there is broad agreement that negative carbon emissions may be required in order to meet the global climate change targets specified in the Paris Agreement and that carbon sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere can be an important contributor, there are important accounting issues that often discourage forest carbon sequestration projects. The legislation establishing the California forest offset program, for example, requires that offsets be “real, additional, quantifiable, permanent, verifiable, and enforceable”. While these are all clearly desirable attributes, their implementation has been a great challenge in balancing complexity, expense, and risk. Most forest offset protocols carry similar accounting objectives, but often with different details, (e.g. Richards and Huebner in Carbon Manag 3(4):393–410, 2012 and Galik et al. in Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change 14:677–690, 2009). The result is that the complexity, expense, and risk of participation discourage participation and make it more difficult to achieve climate mitigation goals. We focus on the requirements for accounting and permanence to illustrate that current requirements disproportionately disadvantage small landowners. Results The simplified 1040EZ filing system for U.S. income taxes may provide insight for a protocol model that balances reward, effort, and risk, while still achieving the overall objectives of standardized offset protocols. In this paper, we present initial ideas and lay the groundwork behind a “2050EZ” protocol for forest carbon sequestration as a complement to existing protocols. Conclusion The Paris Agreement states that “Parties should take action to conserve and enhance, as appropriate, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases.” The Paris Agreement also refers to issues such as equity, sustainable development, and other non-carbon benefits. The challenge is to provide incentives for maintaining and increasing the amount of carbon sequestered in the biosphere. Monitoring and verification of carbon storage need to be sufficient to demonstrate sequestration from the atmosphere while providing clear incentives and simple accounting approaches that encourage participation by diverse participants, including small land holders.",2019-12-03,10.1186/s13021-019-0131-y,"['Wise, Lindsey', 'Marland, Eric', 'Marland, Gregg', 'Hoyle, Jason', 'Kowalczyk, Tamara', 'Ruseva, Tatyana', 'Colby, Jeffrey', 'Kinlaw, Timothy']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13021-019-0131-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

1804,Behavioral sources of the demand for carbon offsets: an experimental study,"Voluntary carbon markets present firms and individuals with the opportunity to offset all or part of their carbon footprints. We report on a controlled laboratory experiment to understand the behavioral motivations driving the purchase of carbon offsets, in addition to investigating the effect of the introduction of voluntary carbon markets on emission-causing activities. We find a stable demand for offsets when the price is sufficiently low. Behavior is, however, heterogeneous. Individuals with a high (low) personal-responsibility index increase their offset purchases as their own damage (total damages) increases, but do not condition their offsetting behavior on the total damages (own damage) generated. We also show that, when individuals trade in competitive markets, the availability of offsets does not affect the total damages generated. Introduction of carbon offsets increases individuals’ earnings by eliminating some of the damages ex-post, but does not increase economic efficiency.",2019-09-01,10.1007/s10683-018-09601-y,"['Kuhn, Kai-Uwe', 'Uler, Neslihan']",Experimental Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10683-018-09601-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

1806,California's success in the socio-ecological practice of a forest carbon offset credit option to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions,"The mitigation of climate change through the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has become a central goal of international policy. An estimated 27 cap-and-trade programs to reduce carbon emissions exist worldwide. But only a small number of them use a forest carbon offset credit option. In 2012, California created a forest carbon offset credit option as part of its greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program. The offset credits have come primarily from US forests that meet requirements for additional, verifiable increases in carbon storage through improved forest management. California, with the help of its cap-and-trade program and modest carbon offset option, has met its initial goal for lower carbon emissions. This case study reveals a gap in socio-ecological practice research on a forest carbon offset credit option by identifying seven measures of success. These seven measures show how a forest carbon offset credit option can enhance a cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Countries and regions that are using or contemplating the use of a forest carbon offset credit option can employ these seven measures to design, evaluate, or upgrade their forest carbon offset programs.",2019-06-01,10.1007/s42532-019-00017-3,"['Kim, Chaeri', 'Daniels, Thomas']",Socio-Ecological Practice Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s42532-019-00017-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1807,South Carolina forestland owners’ willingness to accept compensations for carbon sequestration,"Background Carbon sequestration through recommended forest management practices is an ecosystem service that helps mitigate climate change and its impacts while generating carbon credits for forestland owners to sell in cap-and-trade programs. The California’s cap-and-trade program (California’s carbon market hereafter) allows forestland owners from any part of the contiguous United States to supply carbon credits to compliance entities. In this study, we estimate South Carolina (SC) private forestland owners’ willingness to accept compensations to participate in the California’s carbon market using a contingent valuation method. Results We estimate forestland owners’ mean willingness to accept as $67 per acre per year. Our results reveal higher probability of participation of forestland owners with interests in preserving forest ecosystems than those who do not. Additionally, forestland owners who trust in information about climate change from scientists or government are willing to participate more than those who do not. Conclusions Various factors hinder landowners’ ability to participate in carbon markets. Forestland owners in SC consider legislative uncertainty and long-time commitment as the main barriers to participation in California’s carbon market. From this research, average forestland tenure in SC is 27 years, which is far less than the 100-year time commitment of the California’s carbon market. Of those who agreed to participate, choosing between adopting and not adopting any of the three main forest management practices in the California’s carbon market: 28% are likely to adopt improved forest management (IFM) practices, 24% are likely to adopt reforestation due to understocked forestlands, and 14% are likely to adopt avoided conversion. In another development, the concept of aggregation has dominated discussions in the California’s carbon market of late. It is an advocacy to include small-scale forestlands in the California’s carbon market. To aggregate, different forestland owners will combine their forestlands to participate. We find that 79% of SC forestland owners are willing to aggregate to participate. However, this research is unable to determine how much total forestland is available in SC for carbon market. We recommend future research in the State on forestland owners’ participation in carbon market should consider evaluating forestland availability.",2019-03-25,10.1186/s40663-019-0175-1,"['Alhassan, Mustapha', 'Motallebi, Marzieh', 'Song, Bo']",Forest Ecosystems,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40663-019-0175-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1808,Environmental Impacts in Relation to Wind Energy,"The environmental impacts irrespective of the energy source can range from extremely deleterious to acceptable minimum levels. In the case of fossil power generation, impacts could be extremely harmful in terms of long-term human health hazards. In the case of renewable energies such as solar and wind, the effect on health can be of acceptable levels, whereas in the case of biomass and bioenergy, it can be a minimax depending upon the surrounding environmental areas. For example, if farm products, located in sparsely populated areas with low-density development, are used for power generation, depending upon the level of carbon emissions, these could be acceptable for interim power generation. Thus, in addition to large scale, medium scale, or small scale of operation, consideration of the location where the generation takes place is important.

However, concerns have repeatedly been raised about whether stakeholders in REDD+ host countries will actually end up bearing the costs of REDD+. Most prior analyses of the costs of REDD+ have focused on the opportunity costs of foregone alternative uses of forest land. We draw on a pan-tropical study of 22 subnational REDD+ initiatives in five countries to explore patterns in implementation costs, including which types of organizations are involved and which are sharing the costs of implementing REDD+. We find that many organizations involved in the implementation of REDD+, particularly at the subnational level and in the public sector, are bearing implementation costs not covered by the budgets of the REDD+ initiatives.

1820,A Short History of the Evolution of the Climate Smart Agriculture Approach and Its Links to Climate Change and Sustainable Agriculture Debates,"Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an approach to guide the management of agriculture in the era of climate change. The concept was first launched in 2009, and since then has been reshaped through inputs and interactions of multiple stakeholders involved in developing and implementing the concept. CSA aims to provide globally applicable principles on managing agriculture for food security under climate change that could provide a basis for policy support and recommendations by multilateral organizations, such as UN’s FAO. The major features of the CSA approach were developed in response to limitations in the international climate policy arena in the understanding of agriculture’s role in food security and its potential for capturing synergies between adaptation and mitigation. Recent controversies which have arisen over CSA are rooted in longstanding debates in both the climate and sustainable agricultural development policy spheres. These include the role of developing countries, and specifically their agricultural sectors, in reducing global GHG emissions, as well as the choice of technologies which may best promote sustainable forms of agriculture. Since the term ʻCSA’ was widely adopted before the development of a formal conceptual frame and tools to implement the approach, there has been considerable variation in meanings applied to the term, which also contributed to controversies. As the body of work on the concept, methods, tools and applications of the CSA approach expands, it is becoming clearer what it can offer. Ultimately, CSA’s utility will be judeged by its effectiveness in integrating climate change response into sustainable agricultural development strategies on the ground.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-61194-5_2,"['Lipper, Leslie', 'Zilberman, David']",Climate Smart Agriculture,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-61194-5_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

1825,Mapping the Necessary Policy Instruments to Unlock the Potentials of Private Finance for Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies,"The Paris Agreement adopted at COP21 states that it is necessary to reduce 55 GtCO_2-eq that is anticipated in 2030 to 40 GtCO_2-eq in order to keep the global average temperature rise within 2 °C based on before industrialization. Moreover, we should peak out GHG emissions worldwide as quickly as possible, and should aim to achieve a well-balanced artificial discharge and absorption in the second half of the century. Estimates under diverse assumptions suggest that the total global emissions should be 55 GtCO_2-eq in 2025 and 56.2 GtCO_2-eq in 2030. However, this is insufficient for achieving the second goal (56.2 GtCO_2-eq). Improvement pressure on high emission countries such as Japan tends to increase in the process where improvement of Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is required at the stocktaking meeting of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In the future, important factors for promoting global warming countermeasures are investment not only from public sector but also private sector for emission reduction measures and cost burden method associated with carbon emissions. Although Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is attracting attention, as one of the technologies that can contribute to achieving the climate goal, the investment cost is high and its development is difficult. The major reasons for the difficulty of deployment are not only the cost but also the impacts derived from deployment of the CCS technologies (CCSTs). In order to develop and expand CCSTs as a promising solution towards low-carbon development, it is essential to improve the social and economic environment such as institutional and funding mechanisms that support development of CCS projects. Since CCS technologies are expensive, in addition to CCTs, it is desirable to develop financial support schemes.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-981-10-8582-6_5,"['Ogihara, Akira']",Financing for Low-carbon Energy Transition,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-10-8582-6_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1826,Global Problems and Global Countermeasures,"This chapter indicates that the global response is necessary to address global problems in our interconnected world. To design the global response, a global perspective is necessary as a theoretical basis for such a design. To this end, this chapter reviews social contract theories used to analyze the structural problems of society at a national level, with solutions to the problems. Then, the chapter extends such theories to the international level where structural problems parallel those of society at a national level. The results of the theoretical analysis confirm that the strategy of rapidly spreading green infrastructure throughout the world is an effective solution that follows the direction prescribed by social theories on human society. Based on this finding, this chapter outlines a roadmap for the implementation of the strategy to spread green infrastructure globally.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-71770-8_10,"['Koh, Jae Myong']",Green Infrastructure Financing,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-71770-8_10,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1827,The Willingness of Non-Industrial Private Forest Owners to Enter California’s Carbon Offset Market,"While non-industrial private forest landowners have a significant amount of forest landholdings in the US, they are underrepresented in the California cap-and-trade market forest offset program. Additional participation could benefit both the market and non-industrial private forest landowners. We developed a mail questionnaire which served as both a survey instrument and outreach tool about the market. Questions covered forest ownership objectives, landowners’ future plans for forests, views of climate change, and attitudes and intentions regarding forest carbon offset project development. We sampled from five Northern California counties for a total of 143 usable surveys. Three different groups of landowners were identified based on their management objectives: amenity (including protecting nature and recreation); legacy (passing land to children and/or maintaining a farm or ranch); and income. Landowner objective groups differed on several key variables, particularly related to potential motivations for joining the market, while all landowners expressed concerns about protocol requirements. Regardless of ownership objectives, over half expressed that receiving revenue from their forests would be an important motivator to join, though most were unwilling to satisfy protocol requirements, even after learning of the potential benefits of program participation. Thus, participation appears to be limited by the costly and complex project development process, as well as a lack of landowner awareness. Extending these lessons, we assert that different landowners may approach payment for ecosystem services programs with different needs, awareness, and motivations, which provide important lessons for those who conduct landowner outreach and for PES program designers.",2017-11-01,10.1007/s00267-017-0918-0,"['Kelly, Erin Clover', 'Gold, Gregg J.', 'Tommaso, Joanna']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-017-0918-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1828,High resolution remote sensing for reducing uncertainties in urban forest carbon offset life cycle assessments,"Background Urban forests reduce greenhouse gas emissions by storing and sequestering considerable amounts of carbon. However, few studies have considered the local scale of urban forests to effectively evaluate their potential long-term carbon offset. The lack of precise, consistent and up-to-date forest details is challenging for long-term prognoses. Therefore, this review aims to identify uncertainties in urban forest carbon offset assessment and discuss the extent to which such uncertainties can be reduced by recent progress in high resolution remote sensing. We do this by performing an extensive literature review and a case study combining remote sensing and life cycle assessment of urban forest carbon offset in Berlin, Germany. Main text Recent progress in high resolution remote sensing and methods is adequate for delivering more precise details on the urban tree canopy, individual tree metrics, species, and age structures compared to conventional land use/cover class approaches. These area-wide consistent details can update life cycle inventories for more precise future prognoses. Additional improvements in classification accuracy can be achieved by a higher number of features derived from remote sensing data of increasing resolution, but first studies on this subject indicated that a smart selection of features already provides sufficient data that avoids redundancies and enables more efficient data processing. Our case study from Berlin could use remotely sensed individual tree species as consistent inventory of a life cycle assessment. However, a lack of growth, mortality and planting data forced us to make assumptions, therefore creating uncertainty in the long-term prognoses. Regarding temporal changes and reliable long-term estimates, more attention is required to detect changes of gradual growth, pruning and abrupt changes in tree planting and mortality. As such, precise long-term urban ecological monitoring using high resolution remote sensing should be intensified, especially due to increasing climate change effects. This is important for calibrating and validating recent prognoses of urban forest carbon offset, which have so far scarcely addressed longer timeframes. Additionally, higher resolution remote sensing of urban forest carbon estimates can improve upscaling approaches, which should be extended to reach a more precise global estimate for the first time. Conclusions Urban forest carbon offset can be made more relevant by making more standardized assessments available for science and professional practitioners, and the increasing availability of high resolution remote sensing data and the progress in data processing allows for precisely that.",2017-10-04,10.1186/s13021-017-0085-x,"['Tigges, Jan', 'Lakes, Tobia']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13021-017-0085-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1829,Model Use in WEF Nexus Analysis: a Review of Issues,"Purpose of Review The purpose of this review was to discuss challenges regarding model use in water energy food nexus analysis. Recent Findings Water, energy, and food (WEF) nexus analysis endeavors are relatively new. Modeling systems are just evolving and there are challenges that arise in performing high-quality analysis. We discuss many of these. Summary Nexus modeling must represent and describe complex interrelationships among WEF systems. Modeling is a necessity as the nexus approach is about widening perspectives to unexplored levels. Nexus analysis systems must consider situations that vary from place to place and over time while integrating a family of models that address various components. Challenges arise in representing an appropriate geographic region while encompassing the relevant WEF using/producing activities along with heterogeneous, situation-specific, component interrelationships in a manner that supports decisions. Accounting for uncertainty and the evolution of population along with changes in biophysical, socioeconomic, economic, and climatic elements over time further compounds the challenge. In addition, challenges arise when one needs to describe previously unimplemented strategies both now and into an uncertain future represented by climate change, population growth, and other interacting forces. Comprehensive studies are needed to address these challenges and show the value of WEF nexus analysis. This paper addresses modeling-related challenges that arise when considering how to perform informative and accurate WEF nexus analyses.",2017-09-01,10.1007/s40518-017-0078-0,"['McCarl, Bruce A.', 'Yang, Yingqian', 'Schwabe, Kurt', 'Engel, Bernard A.', 'Mondal, Alam Hossain', 'Ringler, Claudia', 'Pistikopoulos, Efstratios N.']",Current Sustainable/Renewable Energy Reports,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40518-017-0078-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1830,Typology of Nonindustrial Private Forest Landowners and Forestry Behavior: Implications for Forest Carbon Sequestration in the Southern US,"To implement effective climate change mitigation and carbon sequestration activities in the southern US, nonindustrial private forest landowner ( NIPF) participation is necessary because of the significant area of forest land under their ownership. For policy implementation to involve this major ownership group in climate change mitigation activities in this region, it is important to understand their forest management motivations and understanding toward carbon sequestration. This study develops a regional typology of NIPF landowners based on reasons for owning forest land in the southern US. The specific goals were to: (1) segment NIPF landowners into smaller homogeneous groups based on reasons for owning forest land; (2) identify landownership characteristics and forest management behavior by ownership groups; and (3) assess their climate change beliefs and understanding of forest carbon sequestration by ownership groups. A principal component-cluster analysis of 735 responses to a mail questionnaire distributed to NIPF landowners in the southern US revealed three groups, which were named amenity, multi-objective, and timber-oriented landowners. The amenity group included 21% of the landowners, while the timber and multi-objective groups included 40% and 39% of the landowners, respectively. These landowner groups varied in terms of owner characteristics, forest species type and management behavior, climate change beliefs and understanding of carbon sequestration. The amenity and multi-objective owners tend to have more positive belief toward climate change than the timber group, but more landowners in each group indicated having poor understanding of forest carbon sequestration. The study fills a knowledge gap in research efforts by developing a regional typology of NIPF landowners and linking it with their forestry resources and management strategies along with their climate change beliefs and understanding of forest carbon sequestration.",2017-09-01,10.1007/s11842-017-9363-4,"['Khanal, Puskar N.', 'Grebner, Donald L.', 'Munn, Ian A.', 'Grado, Stephen C.', 'Grala, Robert K.', 'Henderson, James E.']",Small-scale Forestry,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11842-017-9363-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

1832,"Improving Voluntary Public Good Provision Through a Non-governmental, Endogenous Matching Mechanism: Experimental Evidence","Social norms can help to foster cooperation and to overcome the free-rider problem in the private provision of public goods. This paper focuses on the endogenous establishment of an average-oriented norm which sanctions deviations from average public good contributions. In a laboratory experiment, we analyse whether subjects are willing to implement a punishment and reward scheme at their own expense by applying the theory of non-governmental norm enforcement put forward by Buchholz et al. (J Public Econ Theory 16(6):899–916, 2014 ). Based on their theory, which omits a central authority but introduces an endogenously determined enforcement mechanism, we implement a two-stage public good game. In the first stage, subjects determine the strength of the sanctioning mechanism on their own. In the second stage, they decide on their personal contributions to the public good based on the established mechanism. In line with comparable pool punishment experiments, we find that subjects are apparently willing to contribute funds in order to establish a norm enforcement mechanism. Groups over-invest in the mechanism, but this over-investment decreases over time. These investments seem to be driven by the subjects’ previous individual contributions and partly by a number of strategic considerations, i.e. the previous average contribution made to the public good lowers the investment in the sanctioning mechanism. In the second stage of our experiment, higher norm enforcement parameters tend to lead to higher public good contributions. The earnings with the mechanism are on average higher than without.",2017-07-01,10.1007/s10640-017-0126-7,"['Reif, Christiane', 'Rübbelke, Dirk', 'Löschel, Andreas']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-017-0126-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1833,Neoclassical realism and international climate change politics: moral imperative and political constraint in international climate finance,"In this article, I present a neoclassical realist theory of climate change politics that challenges the idea that cooperation on climate change is compelled alone by shared norms and interests emanating from the international level and questions if instead material factors also play a significant constraining role. Relative-gains concerns incited by the international resource transfers implicit in climate change policy may compel some states to be prudent in their international climate change efforts and conserve resources domestically for future contingencies, including their own adaptation and resiliency. Neoclassical realism recognises such systemic constraints while also identifying international and domestic factors — a ‘two-level game’ — that explain variation in state sensitivity to relative gains. As a preliminary test of this theory, I compare the latest data on the magnitude, distribution and financial ‘additionality’ of climate funds and carbon markets. Climate funds are found to be more vulnerable to systemic forces identified by neoclassical realism because they are largely drawn from existing official development assistance budgets despite international commitments that funds are ‘new and additional’. Carbon markets engage a relatively broader number of states and, contrary to moral hazard concerns, have been used to a greater degree by states reducing emissions domestically. While there are concerns about whether carbon credits represent genuine emission reductions, the effectiveness of climate funds is equally, if not more, dubious. I conclude that, while imperfect, carbon markets have too often been unfairly compared with an ideal climate finance mechanism that assumes few political constraints on international resource transfers for climate change.",2017-04-01,10.1057/jird.2013.5,"['Purdon, Mark']",Journal of International Relations and Development,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/jird.2013.5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1834,Assessing effect of dominant land-cover types and pattern on urban forest biomass estimated using LiDAR metrics,"Accurate estimates of biomass in urban forests can help improve strategies for enhancing ecosystem services. Landscape heterogeneity, such as land-cover types and their spatial arrangements, greatly affects biomass growth, and it complicates the estimation of biomass. Application of LiDAR data is a typical approach for mapping forest biomass and carbon stocks across heterogeneous landscapes. However, little is known about how urban land uses and pattern impact biomass and estimates derived from LiDAR analysis. In this study, we examined the relationship between LiDAR-derived biomass and dominant land-cover types using field-measured estimates of aboveground forest biomass in an urbanized region of North Carolina, USA. Three objectives drove this research: 1) we examined the local effects of dominant land cover types on urban forest biomass; 2) we identified the spatial scale at which dominant land cover influences biomass estimates; 3) we investigated whether the fine-scale, spatial heterogeneity of the urban landscape contributed to forest biomass. We used multiple linear regression to relate field-measured biomass to LiDAR metrics and land cover densities derived from Landsat and LiDAR data. The biomass model developed from variables derived from LiDAR first returns produced biomass estimates similar to using all LiDAR returns. Although three land-cover types (impervious surface, managed clearings, and farmland) exhibited a negative relationship with biomass, only impervious surface was statistically significant. The biomass model that used impervious surface densities between 100 m and 175 m radial buffers produced the highest adjusted R ^2 with lower RMSE values. Our study suggests that impervious surface impacted forest biomass estimates considerably in urbanizing landscapes with the greatest effect between 100 and 175 m from a forest stand. Managed clearing and farmland types negatively impacted biomass estimation albeit not as strongly as impervious surface. Overall, we found that accounting for impervious surface density and its proximity to forest in biomass models may improve urban forest biomass estimates.",2017-04-01,10.1007/s11252-016-0591-8,"['Singh, Kunwar K.', 'Bianchetti, Raechel A.', 'Chen, Gang', 'Meentemeyer, Ross K.']",Urban Ecosystems,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11252-016-0591-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1835,Carbon sequestration by Australian tidal marshes,"Australia’s tidal marshes have suffered significant losses but their recently recognised importance in CO_2 sequestration is creating opportunities for their protection and restoration. We compiled all available data on soil organic carbon (OC) storage in Australia’s tidal marshes (323 cores). OC stocks in the surface 1 m averaged 165.41 (SE 6.96) Mg OC ha^−1 (range 14–963 Mg OC ha^−1). The mean OC accumulation rate was 0.55 ± 0.02 Mg OC ha^−1 yr^−1. Geomorphology was the most important predictor of OC stocks, with fluvial sites having twice the stock of OC as seaward sites. Australia’s 1.4 million hectares of tidal marshes contain an estimated 212 million tonnes of OC in the surface 1 m, with a potential CO_2-equivalent value of $USD7.19 billion. Annual sequestration is 0.75 Tg OC yr^−1, with a CO_2-equivalent value of $USD28.02 million per annum. This study provides the most comprehensive estimates of tidal marsh blue carbon in Australia, and illustrates their importance in climate change mitigation and adaptation, acting as CO_2 sinks and buffering the impacts of rising sea level.

1839,On the importance of baseline setting in carbon offsets markets,"Incorporating carbon offsets in the design of cap-and-trade programs remains a controversial issue because of its potential unintended impacts on emissions. At the heart of this discussion is the issue of crediting of emissions reductions. Projects can be correctly, over- or under-credited for their actual emissions reductions. We develop a unified framework that considers the supply of offsets within a cap-and-trade program that allows us to compare the relative impact of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions on overall emissions under different levels of baseline stringency and carbon prices. In the context of a national carbon pricing scheme that includes offsets, we find that the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets can be fully balanced out by under-credited emissions reductions without sacrificing a significant portion of the overall supply of offsets, provided emissions baselines are stringent enough. In the presence of high predicted business-as-usual (BAU) emissions uncertainty or low carbon prices, to maintain the environmental integrity of the program, baselines need to be set at stringent levels, in some cases below 50 percent of predicted BAU emissions. As predicted BAU emissions uncertainty declines or as the carbon market achieves higher equilibrium prices, however, less stringent baselines can balance out the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions. These results imply that to maintain environmental integrity of offsets programs, baseline stringency should be tailored to project characteristics and market conditions that influence the proportion of over-credited offsets to under-credited emissions reductions.",2016-08-01,10.1007/s10584-016-1685-2,"['Bento, Antonio', 'Kanbur, Ravi', 'Leard, Benjamin']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-016-1685-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1840,Moving consensus and managing expectations: media and REDD+ in Indonesia,"This paper investigates policy actors’ positions on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) expressed in Indonesian media, and shows how these policy debates have evolved between 2007 and 2012. Results indicate media debates have moved beyond early, buoyant consensus on REDD+ as a win-win solution for economic growth and environmental conservation, to clearly acknowledge the need for institutional and governance reform. Several shifts in the frequency and nature of REDD+ discourse around 2010 – including from an international to a national level focus and an increase in the level of optimism – suggests the 2010 Letter of Intent between Indonesia and Norway has the potential to be a significant driver of change. Results also indicate that translating political will into measurable performance at a local or jurisdictional level is likely to require a broader appreciation of the complex interests, expectations and implications associated with the necessary reforms, and stronger engagement with key actor groups whose vested interests go beyond REDD+ itself. We observe an apparent desire on the part of Indonesian national authorities to have their cake and eat it too; that is, to keep their forest and clear it too.",2016-07-01,10.1007/s10584-015-1563-3,"['Cronin, Tim', 'Santoso, Levania', 'Gregorio, Monica', 'Brockhaus, Maria', 'Mardiah, Sofi', 'Muharrom, Efrian']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-015-1563-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1841,Green economy and carbon markets for conservation and development: a critical view,"Green economy aims to use economic rationality and market mechanisms to mute the most ecologically damaging effects of globalized capitalism while reviving economic growth in the global North, fostering development in the South, and decoupling economic growth from environmental decline. An archetypal application of green economy is transnational trade in ecosystem services, including reduced emissions for deforestation and degradation (REDD+). By compensating developing countries for maintaining forests as carbon sinks, this approach is meant to transcend politics and circumvent conflicts over the responsibilities of industrialized and ‘less-developed’ countries that have stymied global climate policy. However, carbon-offset trading is unlikely to result in lower greenhouse gas emissions, much less combined conservation and development gains. The troubled record of payment for environmental services and other schemes or commodification of nature illustrates that living ecosocial systems do not fit the requirements of market contracts. Disputes over proto-REDD+ projects point to the dangers that REDD+ will disadvantage or dispossess rural communities and distract attention from underlying causes of forest and livelihood loss. Two decades of all-but-futile climate negotiations have shown that global warming cannot be managed by means of technocratic expertise nor dealt with separately from the politics of inequality and the paradox of economic growth. The deceptive promise of greening with growth can blind us to these realities.

Unlike previous studies, which are mostly conceptual, qualitative, or focused on one or few eco-labels, we study a large set of eco-labels, combining data from three different sources.

The experience indicates that the lack of financial sustainability of PES projects is a major reason for the reversibility of environmental improvements once external funding stops. Long-term financial sustainability can however be achieved, if PES projects allow for the creation of markets for environmental goods driven by innovative local entrepreneurs. Such hybrid PES schemes may be especially adequate for developing countries that face financial constraints on different levels.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-19345-8_1,"['Aerni, Philipp']",The Sustainable Provision of Environmental Services,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-19345-8_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

I add case study discussions to give more depth to abstract discussions: a comparison between tobacco control and climate change policies; and analysis of the current debate on ‘fracking’ which raises practical concerns regarding the use of evidence in issues involving an unpredictable mix of high salience, scientific uncertainty, policy ambiguity, multi-level governance, and public protest.",2016-01-01,10.1057/978-1-137-51781-4_4,"['Cairney, Paul']",The Politics of Evidence-Based Policy Making,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1057/978-1-137-51781-4_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1847,Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategies in Japan and Their Implications in China’s Future Energy Development,"This chapter describes energy efficiency and conservation strategies in Japan by showing the historical trends of energy consumption and energy efficiency improvements. The Japanese experience demonstrates that efforts to solve environmental problems have served to improve energy efficiency in various fields. A mitigation scenario to halve global GHG emissions by 2050 is presented, and a comparison is done between effective technologies in Japan and China to achieve the target. Although the model analysis shows that a certain set of technologies can improve energy efficiency by 3 % per year and CO_2 intensity with respect to GDP by 3.5 % per year in China by 2050, implementation of the scenario depends on a number of more specific conditions: rates of installation must be achievable; sufficient finance must be mobilised; and barriers to the adoption of low carbon technologies must be overcome. With China’s progress in energy efficiency improvement, there are greater opportunities for the country to take further steps in this area so as to contribute not only to economic development and energy security, but also to global climate stabilisation.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-981-10-0928-0_7,"['Kainuma, Mikiko', 'Akashi, Osamu']",China's Energy Efficiency and Conservation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-10-0928-0_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1848,Carbon Crime in the Voluntary Market: An Exploration of Modernization Themes Among a Sample of Criminal and Non-criminal Organizations,"The international voluntary carbon market allows economic actors to profit financially by selling carbon reduction projects (as carbon credits) in the marketplace. The objective of this work is to examine the ideology of that market and its implications for crime and climate change. More specifically, we compare advertising messages for two sets of actors in the voluntary carbon market: criminal and non-criminal organizations. To carry out this analysis we draw upon a grounded theory approach to analyze marketing websites for a sample of organizations that sell credits. We discover that overall, organizations draw upon ecological modernization ideology to provide opportunities to gain access to investors and victims by emphasizing (1) sustainability; (2) ethical behaviour; (3) economic development; and, (4) technological innovation. Importantly, statistical analyses failed to differentiate between the forms of modernization ideology employed by legal and illegal actors.",2015-11-01,10.1007/s10612-015-9294-3,"['McKie, Ruth E.', 'Stretesky, Paul B.', 'Long, Michael A.']",Critical Criminology,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10612-015-9294-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1849,Land use and management change under climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies: a U.S. case study,"We examine the effects of crop management adaptation and climate mitigation strategies on land use and land management, plus on related environmental and economic outcomes. We find that crop management adaptation (e.g. crop mix, new species) increases Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 1.7 % under a more severe climate projection while a carbon price reduces total forest and agriculture GHG annual flux by 15 % and 9 %, respectively. This shows that trade-offs are likely between mitigation and adaptation. Climate change coupled with crop management adaptation has small and mostly negative effects on welfare; mitigation, which is implemented as a carbon price starting at $15 per metric ton carbon dioxide (CO_2) equivalent with a 5 % annual increase rate, bolsters welfare carbon payments. When both crop management adaptation and carbon price are implemented the effects of the latter dominates.",2015-10-01,10.1007/s11027-013-9514-7,"['Mu, Jianhong E.', 'Wein, Anne M.', 'McCarl, Bruce A.']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-013-9514-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1850,Biogas: Clean Energy Access with Low-Cost Mitigation of Climate Change,"Using data from the nearly 6000 households in the Nepal Living Standards Survey of 2010–11 we find that the mean reduction in household firewood collection associated with use of a biogas plant for cooking is about 1100 kg/year from a mean of $$\sim $$ ∼ 2400 kg/year. This estimate is derived comparing only households with and without biogas in the same village, thus effectively removing the influence of many potential confounders. Further controls for important determinants of firewood collection, such as household size, per capita consumption expenditure, cattle ownership, unemployment etc. are used to identify the effect of biogas adoption on firewood collection. We derive bounds on omitted variable bias using the proportional selection assumption. Our central estimate is much smaller than those in the previous literature, but is still large enough for the cost of adopting biogas to be heavily subsidized via carbon offsets at a modest carbon price of $10/tCO $$_2$$ 2 e, when using central estimates of emission factors and global warming potentials of pollutants taken from the scientific literature.",2015-10-01,10.1007/s10640-015-9961-6,"['Somanathan, E.', 'Bluffstone, Randall']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-015-9961-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1851,Protected Area Certificates: Gaining Ground for Better Ecosystem Protection?,"Protected areas are vital to sustain a number of ecosystem services. Yet, many protected areas are underfinanced and lack management effectiveness. Protected area certificates have been suggested as a way to resolve these problems. This instrument would allow land managers to certify an area if it meets certain conservation criteria. The certificates could then be sold on an international market, for example to companies and any consumers that are interested in environmental protection. Some pilot initiatives have been launched, yet little is known about future demand and features of protected area certificates. To fill this knowledge gap, we conduct a choice experiment with close to 400 long-distance tourists from Germany as a potential group of buyers. Our results indicate that the respondents have the highest willingness to pay for certificates that conserve sensitive ecosystems and in addition to this lead to poverty reduction and safeguard water resources. For other attributes such as a greenhouse gas reduction, the preferences are less significant. Overall, the results are rather homogenous irrespective of where the protected areas are located. These insights are important for the future design and marketing of protected area certificates.",2015-06-01,10.1007/s00267-015-0476-2,"['Segerstedt, Anna', 'Grote, Ulrike']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-015-0476-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1852,The position of the Low Carbon Growth Partnership (LCGP): at the end of Japan’s navigation between the Kyoto Protocol and the APP,"A new climate change institutional package, the East Asia Low Carbon Growth Partnership (LCGP), has been recently developed. The LCGP has significant implications because it was initiated by Japan, which has navigated between the Kyoto Protocol (KP) and the Asia–Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP) but ended the navigation by announcing its intention not to participate in the second commitment period of the KP. This paper investigates the position of the LCGP on the spectrum drawn by the KP and the APP using the theoretical ground of normative contestation. Results show that the normative stance of the LCGP is skewed toward the APP; however, the LCGP differentiates itself from the APP by its own functional properties and through its institutional fit with another regional institution, the East Asia Summit.

1853,Carbon Footprint Taxes,"We analyze whether a carbon consumption tax is logistically feasible. We consider a carbon footprint tax (CFT), which would be modeled after a credit-method value added tax. The basis for the tax would be a product’s carbon footprint, which includes all of the emissions released during production of the good and its inputs as well as any greenhouse gases latent in the product. Our analysis suggests that a pure CFT, requiring the calculation of the carbon footprint of every individual product, may be prohibitively costly. However a hybrid CFT seems economically feasible. The hybrid CFT would give firms the option to either calculate the carbon footprint of their outputs—and have their products taxed based on those footprints—or use product-class specific default carbon footprints as the tax basis, thereby saving on calculation costs. Because the CFT would be levied on all goods consumed domestically, the CFT would keep domestic firms on an even footing with those producing in countries without active climate policy, protecting competitiveness and reducing leakage.",2015-05-01,10.1007/s10640-013-9749-5,"['McAusland, Carol', 'Najjar, Nouri']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-013-9749-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

The chapter highlights key areas of challenges and implications that need to be addressed to continue program development of forest carbon sink projects with the support of financing mechanisms. This study provides possible implications for other provinces or municipalities at a local level in China and other developing countries preparing for, or in the process of, facilitating trading platforms for forest carbon sinks at a national level. This chapter also provides a comparison of the development of voluntary forestry carbon sinks in Yunnan and Zhejiang Provinces. It draws comparisons from four viewpoints: regional financial support, development of organisations, talent development, and exchange of experience. Finally, it concludes that capabilities of forestry resources appraisal should be improved, financial support and experience exchange strengthened, and carbon credit trading strongly promoted.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-11319-7_3,"['Zhu, Ying', 'Lan, Hong', 'Ness, David A.', 'Xing, Ke', 'Schneider, Kris', 'Lee, Seung-Hee', 'Ge, Jing']",Transforming Rural Communities in China and Beyond,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-11319-7_3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1857,Multilevel Analysis and Comparison of Climate Change Policies in Argentina and Canada,"Purpose – This chapter discusses and compares the climate change policies of Argentina and Canada at the international, national, and local level. Starting with a discussion of both Argentina and Canada’s positions in the UNFCCC, the chapter then explains the positions and policies that have been implemented in the national and then local level of each country. Methodology/approach – This chapter is an analysis and comparison of laws, policies, and practices through not only a discursive analysis of their official positive legal meaning but also through an analysis of their actual applied impact. A multilevel institutional analysis is utilized such that the climate change policies of Argentina and Canada are analyzed at the international, national, and local level. Findings – At the international level, a discourse surrounds Argentina and Canada in terms of developing and developed country and global justice. At the national level, each country has different official laws and discourses surrounding climate change; however, at the regional level in both countries, many similarities exist in respect of climate change mitigation and adaptation in both positivistic legal meaning and actual applied reality. This chapter hypothesizes that a problematic gap exists between the climate change institutional framework and the “real” climate change being experienced by local people. Practical implications – The similarities in the actual applied experience of climate change mitigation and adaptation in Argentina (a developing country) and Canada (a developed country) at the regional level, contrasted with the different characteristics at the national and international level, offer insights into the challenge of effective implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Originality/value – The multilevel institutional analysis and comparison of Argentina and Canada in respect of climate change mitigation and adaptation reveal significant structural governance challenges for the effective implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation goals of the UNFCCC. Overcoming these challenges may facilitate implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation goals.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-38670-1_119,"['Hurlbert, Margot A.', 'Mussetta, Paula C.', 'Ivars, Jorge']",Handbook of Climate Change Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-38670-1_119,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1858,Agricultural Extension and Adaptation Under the “New Normal” of Climate Change,"Adapting to climate change is the most serious challenge facing our species. The scale is global, trajectory of onset uncertain and impacts potentially catastrophic (IPCC 2013 ). As further evidence emerges and as the scramble to adapt to the ‘new normal’ intensifies, persistent problems, past failures and new challenges have the potential to converge in a perfect storm. In response, extension and advisory service (EAS) providers have a key role to play as a critical link between farming populations and sources of new information and tools, so that practices can be appropriately adapted. This chapter outlines the challenge of adapting to climate change, identifies past and present points of EAS engagement, and proposes future responses, with a focus on the constraints and conditions of smallholder farmers in the tropics, and the natural resource base upon which agriculture depends.",2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-38670-1_121,"['Simpson, Brent M.', 'Burpee, Gaye']",Handbook of Climate Change Adaptation,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-38670-1_121,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

There are several different possible risks of carbon emission accounting fraud which remain mostly overlooked by researchers to date, despite the fact that such frauds have a negative impact on a country’s economy as well as the real purpose of mitigating carbon emissions.

1860,Potential impact of invasive alien species on ecosystem services provided by a tropical forested ecosystem: a case study from Montserrat,"Local stakeholders at the important but vulnerable Centre Hills on Montserrat consider that the continued presence of feral livestock (particularly goats and pigs) may lead to widespread replacement of the reserve’s native vegetation by invasive alien trees (Java plum and guava), and consequent negative impacts on native animal species. Since 2009, a hunting programme to control the feral livestock has been in operation. However long-term funding is not assured. Here, we estimate the effect of feral livestock control on ecosystem services provided by the forest to evaluate whether the biodiversity conservation rationale for continuation of the control programme is supported by an economic case. A new practical tool (Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment) was employed to measure and compare ecosystem service provision between two states of the reserve (i.e. presence and absence of feral livestock control) to estimate the net consequences of the hunting programme on ecosystem services provided by the forest. Based on this we estimate that cessation of feral livestock management would substantially reduce the net benefits provided by the site, including a 46 % reduction in nature-based tourism (from $419,000 to $228,000) and 36 % reduction in harvested wild meat (from $205,000 to $132,000). The overall net benefit generated from annual ecosystem service flows associated with livestock control in the reserve, minus the management cost, was $214,000 per year. We conclude that continued feral livestock control is important for maintaining the current level of ecosystem services provided by the reserve.",2015-01-01,10.1007/s10530-014-0743-9,"['Peh, Kelvin S.-H.', 'Balmford, Andrew', 'Birch, Jennifer C.', 'Brown, Claire', 'Butchart, Stuart H.

1861,"Family Forest Landowners’ Interest in Forest Carbon Offset Programs: Focus Group Findings from the Lake States, USA","In 2012, focus groups were organized with individuals owning 20+ acres in the Lake States region of the United States (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) to discuss various issues related to forest carbon offsetting. Focus group participants consisted of landowners who had responded to an earlier mail-back survey (2010) on forest carbon offsets. Two focus groups were held per state with an average of eight participants each (49 total). While landowner participant types varied, overall convergence was reached on several key issues. In general, discussion results found that the current payment amounts offered for carbon credits are not likely, on their own, to encourage participation in carbon markets. Landowners are most interested in other benefits they can attain through carbon management (e.g., improved stand species mix, wildlife, and trails). Interestingly, landowner perceptions about the condition of their own forest land were most indicative of prospective interest in carbon management. Landowners who felt that their forest was currently in poor condition, or did not meet their forest ownership objectives, were most interested in participating. While the initial survey sought landowner opinions about carbon markets, a majority of focus group participants expressed interest in general carbon management as a means to achieve reduced property taxes.",2014-12-01,10.1007/s00267-014-0352-5,"['Miller, Kristell A.', 'Snyder, Stephanie A.', 'Kilgore, Mike A.', 'Davenport, Mae A.']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-014-0352-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1862,Optimal NGO Financing of a Resource Management Certification Scheme,"The development of voluntary certification schemes in areas as diverse as fish, coffee and forestry offer the promise of environmental improvements without the requirement of governmental regulation and intervention. In many cases, however, the costs to landholders of making the transition are too large for them to do so. At the same time, the large intermediaries appear to have little economic incentive to introduce certification because the market does not adequately value the environmental benefits. Instead, NGOs and other aid and development agencies who would like to see small producers benefit from the change in production practices have typically stepped in to provide financial support for certification. This paper shows how voluntary price discrimination (in the form of donations) by the consumers that most highly value certification can be used to finance a switch to environmentally sustainable practices and thus address a market failure. This analysis shows that an NGO’s optimal intervention depends on the size of its budget, the elasticity of supply of the product, and the elasticity of participation by producers. NGOs with smaller budgets rely more heavily on lump sum transfers to the intermediary and less heavily on volume and participation-dependent subsidies. Volume and participation dependent subsidies are inversely related to the elasticity of supply and the elasticity of participation in a standard Lerner relationship.",2014-08-01,10.1007/s10640-013-9712-5,"['Fulton, Murray', 'Vercammen, James']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-013-9712-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1863,Connect the dots: managing the fragmentation of global climate governance,"The debate about post-2012 global climate governance has been framed largely by proponents and opponents of the policymaking process established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In light of the proliferation of institutions governing some aspects of climate change, analysts have asked whether a centralized or a polycentric climate governance architecture will be more effective, efficient, equitable, or viable. While these are valid questions, they obscure the fact that global climate governance is already polycentric, or rather: fragmented. This article argues that the more pertinent questions are how to sensibly link the different elements of global climate governance, and what the role of the UNFCCC could be in this regard. We examine these two questions for three aspects of global climate governance: international climate technology initiatives, emerging emissions trading systems, and unilateral trade measures. The article shows that there are strong arguments for coordination in all of these cases, and illustrates the possible role of the UNFCCC. It concludes, however, that possibilities for coordination will eventually be limited by underlying tensions that will plague any future climate governance architecture.",2014-04-01,10.1007/s10018-013-0060-z,"['Asselt, Harro', 'Zelli, Fariborz']",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10018-013-0060-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1864,Orchestration and transnational climate governance,"With multilateral efforts to mitigate climate change in gridlock, attention has turned to transnational climate governance initiatives, through which sub- and non-state actors seek to reduce greenhouse gases. These initiatives include networks of cities committed to lowering their carbon footprints, voluntary corporate reduction targets and disclosure processes, and many of the rules that govern carbon markets. The paper considers the role of “traditional” actors in world politics—states and intergovernmental organizations—in orchestrating such initiatives. This strategy accounts for nearly a third of transnational climate governance initiatives, we find, and upends the conventional dichotomy between “top down” and “bottom up” solutions to global collective action problems. We develop a theory to explain when states and intergovernmental organizations are likely to engage in orchestration, and we provide initial support for this theory with a new dataset of transnational climate governance initiatives and case studies of two of the most active orchestrators, the World Bank and the United Kingdom.",2014-03-01,10.1007/s11558-013-9174-0,"['Hale, Thomas', 'Roger, Charles']",The Review of International Organizations,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11558-013-9174-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1865,Carbon Storage on Non-industrial Private Forestland: An Application of the Theory of Planned Behavior,"Leading scientific experts in the field of climate change suggest that a multifaceted response to global warming should include the use of forest carbon offsets (also known as forest sinks). Emerging emissions reduction legislation in the United States (US) accounts for this recommendation by allowing for carbon offsets derived from domestic forestry projects (e.g. reforestation, afforestation, avoided deforestation). Given that the majority of US forestland is privately owned and non-industrial, the current research employs a behavioral model to measure intentions of private non-industrial forestland owners to participate in carbon sequestration and trading. Results suggest that very few (5.1 %) of these forestland owners are currently involved in carbon sequestration and trading, but half (50.4 %) were at least somewhat interested in exploring opportunities to do so. The Theory of Planned Behavior, acting as the theoretical frame of reference, was extended in the current research to include environmental orientation, innovativeness, perceived risk and tested knowledge, all of which had significant effects on core model constructs: attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and behavioral intentions. The extended model explained a significant amount of the variance related to behavioral intentions to sequester carbon on private US forestland (R^2 = .53).",2013-12-01,10.1007/s11842-013-9235-5,"['Thompson, Derek W.', 'Hansen, Eric N.']",Small-scale Forestry,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11842-013-9235-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

1868,Untangling the confusion around land carbon science and climate change mitigation policy,"Depletion of ecosystem carbon stocks is a significant source of atmospheric CO_2 and reducing land-based emissions and maintaining land carbon stocks contributes to climate change mitigation. We summarize current understanding about human perturbation of the global carbon cycle, examine three scientific issues and consider implications for the interpretation of international climate change policy decisions, concluding that considering carbon storage on land as a means to 'offset' CO_2 emissions from burning fossil fuels (an idea with wide currency) is scientifically flawed. The capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to store carbon is finite and the current sequestration potential primarily reflects depletion due to past land use. Avoiding emissions from land carbon stocks and refilling depleted stocks reduces atmospheric CO_2 concentration, but the maximum amount of this reduction is equivalent to only a small fraction of potential fossil fuel emissions. Two important aims of mitigation policy are to maintain land carbon stocks and reduce terrestrial ecosystem-based emissions.

The economic incentives provided for the industry are categorized and examined with regard to their effectiveness for climate protection purposes. An analysis of the potential use of market-based mechanisms for the shipping sector follows alongside with the review and evaluation of the various proposals for a Maritime Emissions Trading Scheme that are submitted to the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization and are currently under consideration. The importance of the adoption of a maritime global cap-and-trade scheme for climate change mitigation is particularly emphasized. Within this context, it is also considered whether the possible introduction of economic incentive measures on a broader (regional or global) level may cause problems of implementation and how these obstacles can be overcome.",2013-04-01,10.1007/s13437-012-0036-z,"['Nikolakaki, Garyfalia']",WMU Journal of Maritime Affairs,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13437-012-0036-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1871,Policy Experimentation and the Emergence of Domestic Voluntary Carbon Trading in China,"As China has become the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter in terms of total annual emissions, to promote GHG emissions reduction in China turns out to be crucial to the success of the global efforts to address climate change. This paper explores the development of the Chinese Domestic Voluntary Carbon Market (DVCM) in order to understand how carbon trading institutions have emerged and developed in China. To do this, it traces and analyzes the roles of the Chinese government and other key actors. Through process tracing and literature review, it argues that the pre-legislation and territorially fragmented development pattern of the Chinese DVCM has resulted from the activities of Chinese local governments and non-state actors under the policy experimentation approach adopted by the Chinese central government. It concludes with brief comments on the Chinese policy experimentation approach, and suggests that some measures can be taken to promote voluntary emissions reduction and policy learning.",2013-03-01,10.1007/s12140-013-9188-5,"['Huang, Yitian']",East Asia,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12140-013-9188-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

1873,Community Participation Mechanism: A Study of Youth Voices in Conservation’s GreenLeaf Marketplace,"This chapter focuses on international mechanisms for addressing climate change, focusing on linkages and multistakeholder communications, adaptations, and adoptions for greater sustainability. Since the Kyoto Protocol was organized, the idea of creating a carbon credit marketplace has been widely discussed. The United Nations has created a carbon credit certification process, and, at this point, there are a number of recognized evaluators for these credits. Unfortunately, the credit marketplace has substantially changed, and the availability of using this type of financial transaction for encouragement of developing countries to utilize their present initiatives to receive funds for their transition towards sustainability for which the developed countries and corporations would purchase these credits has failed. Failure in the sense that when funds are received by these developing countries, these funds are often diverted and actions towards a lower-carbon lifestyle have not been achieved. Conversely, a number of agencies have funded more localized projects that engage in developing sustainable actions in communities through improved mechanisms, such as sustainable forestry and agriculture and sustainable lifestyles including improved cooking stoves, water recycling, and waste recycling through biogas generation. Many of these projects at the point of achievement for their sustainability lack continued funding necessary to allow for sustainable development. The Youth Voices in Conservation Program has researched youth action towards conservation and sustainability from the classroom, the field site, and within nongovernmental and governmental organizational situations for the past few years. This research found that by developing a residual funding based upon carbon credit offsets created by these localized actions, there is a possibility of conditional cash transfer based upon these “good actions.” During the latter half of July 2011, intensive fieldwork in conjunction with UNDP-GEF Small Grants Projects and Center for Environment Education (CEE) occurred in India. Ten projects were evaluated for the establishment of an intranet/Internet evaluation mechanism that would allow for the development of the GreenLeaf Marketplace. Projects were also evaluated for their approach to reducing the carbon impact which correlated to the community financially, educationally, and environmentally. Detailed description of how this methodology works for developing financial environmental and financial communities will be discussed. It is hoped through a global mechanism that other localities throughout the world will be able to sign up through this computer-based system. The results of this research indicate that the Youth Voices in Conservation’s GreenLeaf Program may be able to address localized sustainability issues as well as methodology for decreasing carbon footprints and increasing financial sustainabilities within each community, and consequently, the environmental effects from the wide-scale adoption of these plans may be expected. It is anticipated that these credit mechanisms may be used with local bank issuance for green purposes with conditional cash transfer as part of the residual credit program.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5995-4_8,"['Sonnenschein, Leonard']",Mechanism Design for Sustainability,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5995-4_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1874,Climate Change Mitigation in Developing Countries Using ICT as an Enabling Tool,"ICT is envisaged to be an important tool in the communication of climate change mitigation technologies, which are necessarily of low carbon footprint in order to reduce GHG emissions. This paper, based on literature, illustrates how new and emerging ICTs will be applied in developing countries to mitigate impacts of climate change. It highlights some smart applications, like the smart grid, mobile phone, ICT-enabled technologies for energy efficiency and management, ICT-enabled smart technologies for transportation, land use change and forestry emissions mitigation, smart motors for enhancing carbon footprint reduction in manufacturing and smart buildings technologies. Detailed review and analysis of emerging economies, notably China and Brazil, were used to identify and recommend appropriate ICT-enabled climate change mitigation technologies. It concludes that while ICTs with low carbon footprints are potentially capable of mitigating impacts of climate change, there are existing constraints that these countries must overcome, including capacity building and ICT-embedded carbon-offset project financing. It is recommended that collaboration among policymakers, academia, research and business be enhanced, and capacity building could go a long way towards the realisation of this.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-37753-2_2,"['Niyibizi, Abel', 'Komakech, Alexander']",Climate-Smart Technologies,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-37753-2_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

1876,Uncertainty in Refurbishment Investment,"Nearly zero-energy refurbishments provide many of the benefits of nearly zero-energy buildings to the aging building stock and offer an opportunity to make them more resource-efficient and environmentally friendly, with an increased social and financial value. However, high initial costs and uncertainties about the expected benefits characterize this type of investment and affect the building stakeholders’ decision on whether to go ahead with such a project or not. Given the special case of existing buildings and associated challenges to refurbish them to nearly zero energy, this chapter identifies and classifies uncertainties that characterize and make this type of investment a highly uncertain endeavor over the project life cycle. It also provides recommendations about managing these uncertainties during the project evaluation phase.

1877,Seeing the trees for the carbon: agroforestry for development and carbon mitigation,"Land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities will play an important role in global climate change mitigation. Many carbon schemes require the delivery of both climate and rural development benefits by mitigation activities conducted in developing countries. Agroforestry is a LULUCF activity that is gaining attention because of its potential to deliver climate benefits as well as rural development benefits to smallholders. There is hope that agroforestry can deliver co-benefits for climate and development; however experience with early projects suggests co-benefits are difficult to achieve in practice. We review the literature on agroforestry, participatory rural development, tree-based carbon projects and co-benefit carbon projects to look at how recommended project characteristics align when trying to generate different types of benefits. We conclude that there is considerable tension inherent in designing co-benefit smallholder agroforestry projects. We suggest that designing projects to seek ancillary benefits rather than co-benefits may help to reduce this tension.",2012-12-01,10.1007/s10584-012-0456-y,"['Anderson, Emily K.', 'Zerriffi, Hisham']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-012-0456-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

In particular we examine attempts by foreign investors to forge voluntary carbon agreements with customary landowners after the Bali climate change conference of 2007, and the mobilization of state institutions to counter these ‘private dealings’. We highlight the connection between the ways that these processes played out at both national and local scales, with a focus on the highly contentious Kamula Doso forest area in Western Province. We conclude with some observations on the way that the constitutional protection of customary land rights inhibits the formalization of marketable rights in forest resources, including forest carbon, and creates an inconclusive circularity in the operation of forest policy and property processes at different levels of social and political organization.",2012-10-01,10.1007/s10745-012-9531-2,"['Filer, Colin', 'Wood, Michael']",Human Ecology,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10745-012-9531-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

Results indicate that smallholder agroforestry is viewed positively as a suitable strategy for Rwandan smallholder farmers. The most important positive features were the potential for increased agricultural output from agroforestry and a favorable policy environment in Rwanda supporting sustainable agriculture. Results also indicate that there needs to be better coordination of various efforts to promote agroforestry and stronger extension services for smallholder farmers.

1880,The Potential Role for Management of U.S. Public Lands in Greenhouse Gas Mitigation and Climate Policy,"Management of forests, rangelands, and wetlands on public lands, including the restoration of degraded lands, has the potential to increase carbon sequestration or reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions beyond what is occurring today. In this paper we discuss several policy options for increasing GHG mitigation on public lands. These range from an extension of current policy by generating supplemental mitigation on public lands in an effort to meet national emissions reduction goals, to full participation in an offsets market by allowing GHG mitigation on public lands to be sold as offsets either by the overseeing agency or by private contractors. To help place these policy options in context, we briefly review the literature on GHG mitigation and public lands to examine the potential for enhanced mitigation on federal and state public lands in the United States. This potential will be tempered by consideration of the tradeoffs with other uses of public lands, the needs for climate change adaptation, and the effects on other ecosystem services.",2012-03-01,10.1007/s00267-011-9806-1,"['Olander, Lydia P.', 'Cooley, David M.', 'Galik, Christopher S.']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-011-9806-1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1881,Carbon Offset Markets: A Viable Instrument?,"In this article, we explore the realm of carbon offset markets that have been set up to enable consumers to offset their share of carbon emissions. Though the market is a relatively new one, it has quickly spawned countless offset providers under both regulated and voluntary schemes. Our research points out that the market is widely unregulated and, furthermore, there is no common quality or certification structure for the offset providers. At this point in the evolution of the market, only a handful of offset provider ratings schemes exist; and even these schemes leave a vast void for consumers. The article begins with a discussion on the state of the carbon markets including the mandate from the Kyoto Protocol. Next, the article will examine the concept of carbon offsets and provide examples of the market. Our purpose is to present the logic and the working of carbon markets, especially in the space of market instruments aimed at lowering of carbon emissions. Moreover, we ask how this market developed and where is it headed. The article will outline the standards environment for offset providers in order to illustrate the need for a single set of criteria among providers. It will then explore the differences among the providers and articulate the specific criteria upon which providers may be evaluated.

1884,The use of airborne laser scanning to develop a pixel-based stratification for a verified carbon offset project,"Background The voluntary carbon market is a new and growing market that is increasingly important to consider in managing forestland. Monitoring, reporting, and verifying carbon stocks and fluxes at a project level is the single largest direct cost of a forest carbon offset project. There are now many methods for estimating forest stocks with high accuracy that use both Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and high-resolution optical remote sensing data. However, many of these methods are not appropriate for use under existing carbon offset standards and most have not been field tested. Results This paper presents a pixel-based forest stratification method that uses both ALS and optical remote sensing data to optimally partition the variability across an ~10,000 ha forest ownership in Mendocino County, CA, USA. This new stratification approach improved the accuracy of the forest inventory, reduced the cost of field-based inventory, and provides a powerful tool for future management planning. This approach also details a method of determining the optimum pixel size to best partition a forest. Conclusions The use of ALS and optical remote sensing data can help reduce the cost of field inventory and can help to locate areas that need the most intensive inventory effort. This pixel-based stratification method may provide a cost-effective approach to reducing inventory costs over larger areas when the remote sensing data acquisition costs can be kept low on a per acre basis.",2011-10-17,10.1186/1750-0680-6-9,"['Golinkoff, Jordan', 'Hanus, Mark', 'Carah, Jennifer']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/1750-0680-6-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1885,Effectiveness and legitimacy of forest carbon standards in the OTC voluntary carbon market,"Background In recent years, the voluntary over-the-counter (OTC) carbon market has reached a significant market volume. It is particularly interesting for forest mitigation projects which are either ineligible in compliance markets or confronted with a plethora of technical and financial hurdles and lacking market demand. As the OTC market is not regulated, voluntary standards have been created to secure the social and environmental integrity of the traded mitigation projects and thus to ensure the quality of the resulting carbon credits. Building on a theoretical efficiency-legitimacy framework, this study aims to identify and analyse the characteristics and indicators that determine the efficiency and organisational legitimacy of standards for afforestation/reforestation carbon projects. Results All interviewed market actors consider third-party certification and standards as a crucial component of market functionality, which provide quality assurance mechanisms that reduce information asymmetries and moral hazard between the actors regarding the quality of carbon credits, and thus reduce transaction costs. Despite this development, the recent evolution of many new and differing standards is seen as a major obstacle that renders it difficult for project developers and buyers to select an appropriate standard. According to the interviewed experts the most important legitimating factors of standards are assurance of a sufficient level of quality of carbon credits, scientifically substantiated methodological accounting and independent third-party verification, independence of standard bodies, transparency, wide market acceptance, back-up of the wider community including experts and NGOs, rigorous procedures, and the resemblance to the Afforestation/Reforestation (A/R) CDM due to its international policy endorsements. In addition, standards must provide evidence that projects contribute to a positive social and environmental development, do no harm as a minimum requirement and build a strong track record of successful projects. Project developers require clear, easily and practically applicable standards at lowest possible costs with a high potential in order to achieve good carbon prices, while buyers require that standards are legitimate, credible and that no public criticism arises when carbon credits are purchased from projects certified by a certain standard. Conclusions Despite the fragmented and immature state of the OTC market, standards act as 'market-making' intermediaries and contribute to the quality and transparency of the OTC market. However, the variety of different standards imposes new hurdles for their efficiency and often creates confusion instead of confidence among potential buyers. Despite the lacking legitimacy of the standards, pressures from the institutional environment on standards ensure a minimum quality of carbon credits (including positive social and environmental impacts of carbon credits) that serves as an insurance mechanism for the integrity of standards. Its unregulated nature and the pressure from an increasingly competitive environment provides innovative space to deliver efficient certification procedures without imposing unreasonably high transaction costs on market actors. Furthermore, voluntary standards imply a more innovative certification approach, as one legal authority could do, because standards have to compete for adopters backed by civil society organisations. Thereby, the forest sector in OTC voluntary market bears great opportunities to provide the forest sector with crucial lessons for international climate policy and governmental institutions when designing regulation for forest regulation such as international and national REDDplus schemes.",2011-08-17,10.1186/1750-0680-6-4,"['Merger, Eduard', 'Pistorius, Till']",Carbon Balance and Management,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/1750-0680-6-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1886,Payments for Environmental Services in Latin America as a Tool for Restoration and Rural Development,"Payments for Environmental Services (PES) can encourage projects that enhance restoration, production, and rural development. When projects promote differentiated systems by paying farmers for the provision of services, the application of PES requires evaluation of the environmental services provided by each system. We present evaluations of carbon stocks and biodiversity in pure and mixed native tree plantations in Costa Rica. To illustrate how monetary values can be assigned, we discuss a project that awarded PES to silvopastoral systems in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Colombia based on carbon stocks and biodiversity. PES can promote positive environmental attitudes in farmers. Currently this project is being scaled up in Colombia based on their positive experiences with PES as a tool to promote adoption. Compared to PES systems that include only one environmental service, systems that incorporate bundling or layering of multiple services can make sustainable land uses more attractive to farmers and reduce perverse incentives.",2011-05-01,10.1007/s13280-010-0114-4,"['Montagnini, Florencia', 'Finney, Christopher']",AMBIO,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13280-010-0114-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1887,The Ethics of Carbon Neutrality: A Critical Examination of Voluntary Carbon Offset Providers,"In this article, we explore the world’s response to the increasing impact of carbon emissions on the sobering threat posed by global warming: the carbon offset market. Though the market is a relatively new one, numerous offset providers have quickly emerged under both regulated and voluntary regimes. Owing to the lack of technical literacy of some stakeholders who participate in the market, no common quality or certification structure has yet emerged for providers. To the contrary, the media warns that a relative “cowboy” atmosphere prevails in the current environment, and that there are “widespread instances of people and organizations buying worthless credits that do not yield any reductions in carbon emissions” (Harvey and Fidler, Financial Times, 2007 ). At this point in the evolution of the market, only a handful of offset provider-rating schemes exist; and, even these systems leave consumers with few answers when they seek to find a means by which to ensure that the said systems are having their intended impact. The purpose of this article is, first, to provide a grounded understanding of the nature of the offset market, a tendency toward carbon neutrality as a possible point of equilibrium, and the ethical tensions that surround it from the perspective of the consuming public. Second, we outline the standards environment for offset providers to illustrate most effectively the need for a single set of criteria among providers that is readily understandable by the common consumer stakeholder. We then explore the differences among the providers and articulate the specific criteria upon which providers may be evaluated by this particular stakeholder constituency, by bringing together best practices based on currently available analyses. Finally, we share the results of preliminary data collection in connection with 117 offset providers and highlight early findings. These findings allow us comparing providers effectively and efficiently on a common scale that services both providers, who thereby have greater guidance for self-assessment purposes, as well as consumer stakeholders, who then have the ability to make useful and more informed choices about carbon emission reduction in the future.",2011-04-01,10.1007/s10551-011-0766-4,"['Dhanda, K.

1888,Voluntary Carbon Offsets – Empirical Findings of an International Survey,"Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of modern times. Businesses are increasingly developing strategies to manage the exposure to climate risk. A robust carbon strategy should focus on a comprehensive assessment of an organization’s direct and indirect carbon emissions to avoid and reduce these emissions, and finally to offset the emissions that cannot be reduced further. Recently, the voluntary compensation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions emerged as a new business field, which is increasingly attracting public interest. Many different offers for emission compensation have emerged on the market.

1889,The Potential of Ocean Iron Fertilization as an Option for Mitigating Climate Change,"Ocean iron fertilization is currently being discussed as one measure that could contribute to climate change mitigation by stimulating the growth of phytoplankton in certain parts of the ocean and enhancing oceanic CO_2 uptake. Its implementation is greatly debated however and its mitigation potential has not yet been explored well. At present, it is still not possible to use carbon offsets generated through iron fertilization projects for complying with the Kyoto Protocol as trading these offsets is currently only possible on voluntary carbon markets. Company interests in such a commercial use of ocean iron fertilization do however already exist. Consequently, there is a need to explore the potential of ocean iron fertilization as a climate change mitigation option as well as regulatory issues connected with its implementation. This article combines these two aims by first examining the scientific background, quantitative potential, side effects and costs of ocean iron fertilization. In a second step, regulatory aspects such as its legal status and open access issues are reviewed. Moreover, the chapter analyses how the regulations for afforestation and reforestation activities within the framework of the Kyoto Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could be applied to ocean iron fertilization. The main findings of this chapter are that the quantitative potential of ocean iron fertilization is limited, that potential adverse side effects are severe, and that its costs are higher than it was initially hoped. Moreover, the legal status of ocean iron fertilization is currently not well defined, open access might cause inefficiencies, and the CDM regulations could not be easily applied to ocean iron fertilization.",2011-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-20592-7_12,"['Bertram, Christine']",Emissions Trading,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-20592-7_12,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

From the early modifications of the marshlands of Mesopotamia to the draining of the English Fens, the management of wetlands has always reflected the major societal and economic drivers of the times. Early efforts at conservation management focussed primarily on waterbirds, but over the latter part of the twentieth Century there has been a shift of emphasis towards towards ‘wise use’ and an understanding of how ecosystem processes and functions deliver important benefits to human society. The recognition that the natural environment provides societal benefits is crucial to the future conservation of wetlands.

1891,The Way Forward,"The last 100 years has seen a massive assault on the world’s tropical forests. Global statistics on the scale of deforestation and land degradation are surprisingly imprecise but there is no doubt whatsoever of the need for some reforestation to overcome the environmental problems that deforestation and land degradation have unleashed. Though much deforestation was triggered by a search for agricultural land the process has been hugely wasteful and has generated large tracts of under-used or abandoned land. At the same time, deforestation has caused a widespread loss of biodiversity, increased rates of soil erosion, large increases in the emission of greenhouse gases and the persistence of poverty amongst many of the communities living in these landscapes. Perhaps most worrying of all, there is no clear sign that many of these negative trends are slowing. In the meantime, human populations and population densities are continuing to rise.",2011-01-01,10.1007/978-90-481-9870-2_13,"['Lamb, David']",Regreening the Bare Hills,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-90-481-9870-2_13,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1892,The clean development mechanism and community forests in Sub-Saharan Africa: reconsidering Kyoto’s “moral position” on biocarbon sinks in the carbon market,"Negotiations of the Kyoto Protocol reached what has been called a moral position on biocarbon sinks which saw important limitations on their use in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the Protocol’s main carbon offset system. After outlining this moral position, this article examines the consequences of these limitations on the viability of community forest participation in the CDM through a case study of three community forests in West Africa. Results suggest that there is significant carbon mitigation potential from forest conservation, reforestation as well as from improved fuelwood cookstoves at the community level. Yet under the current rules of the CDM, little of this overall carbon mitigation potential is able to be realized. Using qualitative research methodologies, it was learned that community respondents showed a pragmatic, yet cautious interest in the CDM while also emphasizing a need for land-use flexibility. The paper closes with a political discussion of the “‘moral position” on biocarbon sinks in the carbon market and concludes with policy recommendations for biocarbon sinks, in both the CDM and REDD, in the post-Kyoto climate change regime.",2010-12-01,10.1007/s10668-010-9239-7,"['Purdon, Mark']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-010-9239-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1893,Disappearing Rainforests: New Solutions,"In this chapter, the basic motivations for addressing the global deforestation issue – what the major issues and constraints involved will be; and how these might be dealt with – are laid out. The (possibly contentious) observation is made that while the emotion that loss of the large, charismatic natural forests of the developing world generates in many observers of the forest scene worldwide is potentially a driving force for change, it is also prone to misuse: concerned individuals can be led into extreme or unrealistically ideological positions. It is argued that, like it or not, some recognition of legitimate commercial use of forests, and of the importance of national sovereignty in how this is done are as necessary, in the solution of deforestation, as are concerns about loss of biodiversity, unacceptable treatment of local communities in forest areas, and other issues. It is further argued that the large questions as to how global forests can be saved and wisely used must be addressed directly, and in an integrated manner – something which has not happened to any great extent to date: how much forest can and should be sustained? Who should do this? Who will pay? Who should benefit most?",2010-01-01,10.1007/978-90-481-9582-4_1,"['Douglas, Jim', 'Simula, Markku']",The Future of the World's Forests,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-90-481-9582-4_1,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1894,Woody Biomass and Purpose-Grown Trees as Feedstocks for Renewable Energy,"Trees and woody biomass currently provide raw materials for pulp, paper and lumber for the traditional wood products industry. The United States produces the largest amount of wood for industrial applications in the world, and the Southeastern US is an important “wood basket” with more than 365 million green short tons (2,000 pounds or 907 kg) of hardwood and pine being harvested annually. Woody biomass can provide renewable energy by direct firing or co-firing of wood for electricity generation or through the production of liquid fuels. The utilization of woody biomass for the production of electric power is already a relatively common practice, but this application is expanding. In addition, the use of lignocellulosic feedstock, such as wood, for the production of liquid fuels, is developing rapidly due to US government mandates for increased use of biofuels in the nation’s transportation fuel supply. Ethanol is the most common biofuel produced from wood, although wood can also be used to produce gasoline and diesel fuels. Many tree species already used for fiber and sawtimber applications can also be used for biopower and biofuels production. Loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda ) is a native tree purpose-grown widely in the Southeastern US for production of pulp, paper and lumber, but it is has also been used for biopower generation. Faster growing hardwood species such as Populus , Salix , and Eucalyptus can be grown as short rotation woody crops due to their rapid growth and ability to coppice. Specific process elements of biopower and biofuel generation processes are affected by certain tree characteristics, and the suitability of different tree species for different energy production technologies are discussed. Genetic improvement and modifications in silvicultural management can improve the economics of using woody biomass for the production of biopower and bioenergy. Short rotation, purpose-grown trees, developed for high biomass productivity and improved processing capabilities, will have a variety of inherent logistical benefits and economic advantages to other plant materials. Genetic improvement of trees, through conventional breeding and biotechnology, will enhance the quality, productivity, and sustainability of purpose-grown trees, enabling them to meet the renewable resource needs of multiple industrial applications, including bioenergy.",2010-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-13440-1_7,"['Hinchee, Maud A.

Historical overgrazing and aggressive fire suppression have led to the encroachment of woody vegetation and accumulations of woody fuels in these grasslands. Ranchers associated with the Malpai Borderlands Group, state and federal land managers, and the staff of The Nature Conservancy agreed that re-introducing fire could improve landscape productivity and biological diversity. The ranching community was concerned that continued encroachment of woody plants would eventually affect its economic viability and result in the subdivision of ranches and the loss of its way of life. The parties in the borderlands group worked together to develop prescribed fire plans that have resulted in four landscape-level prescribed fires since 1995. They also developed a monitoring plan using established photo points, ground transects, aerial surveys, and remote sensing techniques to ascertain fire effects and to determine if modified procedures could be beneficial. The prescribed fires and results from the monitoring spurred research on wildlife habitat requirements, fire histories, fire behavior, the effects of cool or warm season burning on multiple resources, and interactions of livestock and wildlife grazing and fire. Information from prescribed fires such as those conducted by the borderlands group will become more important as anticipated changes in the region’s climate and vegetation produce new challenges to ranchers and agency land managers.",2009-04-01,10.4996/fireecology.0501085,"['Gottfried, Gerald J.', 'Allen, Larry S.', 'Warren, Peter L.', 'McDonald, Bill', 'Bemis, Ronald J.', 'Edminster, Carleton B.']",Fire Ecology,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.4996/fireecology.0501085,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer

In striving to make development financing more environmentally friendly and sustainable, DFIs can play a key role in promoting the CDM on the African continent by providing monetary incentives through their project financing activities; encouraging and facilitating partnerships in support of sustainable development, particularly with reference to the CDM, and; providing technical advice and support to clients with regard to project design, planning and implementation. DFIs have traditionally focused on financing infrastructure and poverty alleviation projects. However, the emergence of the CDM has brought about a shift towards investments in services and products that reduce carbon dioxide emissions and encourage investments in environmentally friendly technologies. This can be ascribed in part to the development of a “carbon market” under the auspices of the Kyoto Protocol that took effect in February 2005.

Trade-Based Carbon Sequestration Accounting
","This article describes and illustrates an accounting method to assess and compare “early” carbon sequestration investments and trades on the basis of the number of standardized CO_2 emission offset credits they will provide. The “gold standard” for such credits is assumed to be a relatively riskless credit based on a CO_2 emission reduction that provides offsets against CO_2 emissions on a one-for-one basis. The number of credits associated with carbon sequestration needs to account for time, risk, durability, permanence, additionality, and other factors that future trade regulators will most certainly use to assign “official” credits to sequestration projects. The method that is presented here uses established principles of natural resource accounting and conventional rules of asset valuation to “score” projects. A review of 20 “early” voluntary United States based CO_2 offset trades that involve carbon sequestration reveals that the assumptions that buyers, sellers, brokers, and traders are using to characterize the economic potential of their investments and trades vary enormously. The article develops a “universal carbon sequestration credit scoring equation” and uses two of these trades to illustrate the sensitivity of trade outcomes to various assumptions about how future trade auditors are likely to “score” carbon sequestration projects in terms of their “equivalency” with CO_2 emission reductions. The article emphasizes the importance of using a standard credit scoring method that accounts for time and risk to assess and compare even unofficial prototype carbon sequestration trades. The scoring method illustrated in this article is a tool that can protect the integrity of carbon sequestration credit trading and can assist buyers and sellers in evaluating the real economic potential of prospective trades.",2004-08-01,10.1007/s00267-003-9112-7,"['King, Dennis M.']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-003-9112-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1902,"Land-Use Change, Carbon Sequestration and Poverty Alleviation","In this article, we seek to identify where the greatest potential for synergies between carbon sequestration and poverty alleviation lie and ways they can be enhanced. We assess the amount and eligibility criteria of sequestration payment sources to developing countries. Many land-use changes accessible to low-income land users are potentially competitive in a market where payments are likely to range between between $11 to $15 per carbon ton sequestered. We present a conceptual framework of land-use decision-making to assess the potential for sequestration adoption among the poor. The determinants of adoption vary according to the impact of adoption on the returns to productive factors in the absence of any payment for sequestration. Where sequestration leads to a decrease in returns, the key determinant is the return to sequestration and labor, which are driven by the potential sequestration supply per unit land area and labor-use requirements. When sequestration adoption leads to an increase in returns, barriers to land-use change are present, which is frequently the case for the poor. Adoption is determined by the capacity of sequestration payments to overcome constraints. Barrier removal may involve designing payments to overcome risk or investment constraints, or wider institutional reform. Sequestration values may be insufficient to cover costs of institutional reform, requiring incorporation into wider development programs. A survey of results from empirical studies lend support to the analysis. We conclude with an assessment of transaction cost impacts on sequestration adoption among the poor, and how these can be addressed.",2004-07-01,10.1007/s00267-003-9146-x,"['Lipper, Leslie', 'Cavatassi, Romina']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-003-9146-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset market"")",springer
1903,Valuing forestlands with stochastic timber and carbon prices,"We calculate expected bare land values, assuming forestry is the highest and best land use, using a real options methodology with stochastic mean-reverting timber and carbon prices. Land values relect the contribution of both timber as well as carbon stored in three separate pools—the forest, harvested wood products, and emissions avoided by using wood versus carbon-intensive substitute materials. Land values reflect one of three sequestration scenarios that vary the percentages of carbon sequestered in the three pools relative to the carbon sequestered in the forest just prior to the harvest activity. At harvest time, the value of the carbon sequestered in the three pools determines if the forest owner retains income gained from the sale of carbon credits, or must purchase credits to offset emissions associated with the harvest activity. A case study involving a hypothetical western Washington Douglas-fir stand suggests that carbon sequestration may be a significant income contribution for forest owners if the three carbon pools are recognized as credible offsets. However, the income contribution is sensitive to the amount of credit realized for carbon sequestered in each of the pools. The analysis demonstrates the significance of including carbon sequestered in the three separate pools when designing carbon offset policies.",2015-09-01,10.1007/s10479-013-1389-1,"['Petrasek, Stanislav', 'Perez-Garcia, John', 'Bare, B.

Developing countries and emerging economies could supply 627–667 MtCO_2e p.a. at costs of approximately EUR 10 (in 2004 EUR), neglecting transaction costs and country-specific risks.

1905,C and N concentrations in different compartments of outgrown oak coppice forests under different site conditions in Central Italy,"Context Harvesting of Mediterranean oak coppice forests has been progressively suspended on a share of cover over the last decades. Positive growth trend in outgrown coppices no longer harvested on short rotations now drives natural forest restoration on wide areas, and it represents a potential carbon sink in view of global warming. Aims Our goals were to estimate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content per compartment in two deciduous oak outgrown coppice forests, aged differently and growing under unequal site quality, to verify whether C concentration across compartments is in agreement with the conventional conversion rate of 0.5. Methods Ecosystem C and N pools were assessed by multiplying the whole coppice mass (combining specific allometric functions, root-to-shoot ratio, and soil sampling) by respective C and N concentrations. Results The results point out that the largest percentage of N was stored in 15-cm topsoil (84.06 and 73.34 % at the younger and older site, respectively), whereas the proportion of organic ecosystem C pool was more variable, as a consequence of the amount and allocation of phytomass. We found that, in most cases, C concentration was less than the conventional conversion rate of 0.5, especially in deadwood, O layer, and root compartments. Conclusion The findings provide further knowledge of C and N storage into these new built-up forest types and the evidence that a detailed analysis may get higher accuracy in the pools estimate, producing a more reliable outlook on dynamics and climate change mitigation ability of these systems.",2014-12-01,10.1007/s13595-014-0390-4,"['Matteo, Giovanni', 'Tunno, Irene', 'Nardi, Pierfrancesco', 'Angelis, Paolo', 'Bertini, Giada', 'Fabbio, Gianfranco']",Annals of Forest Science,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13595-014-0390-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""greenhouse gas carbon mitigation"")",springer

We identify stylized features of the two mechanisms with a partial equilibrium model. Our work is the first to derive a closed form solution incorporating most policy instruments, such as abatement and offset usage, and delivery risks in offsets. We show that policy changes will impact one market directly and the other indirectly, generating unequal price responses that affects the spread between the two compliance instruments.

1908,The greenhouse gas offset potential from seagrass restoration,"Awarding CO_2 offset credits may incentivize seagrass restoration projects and help reverse greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from global seagrass loss. However, no study has quantified net GHG removal from the atmosphere from a seagrass restoration project, which would require coupled C_org stock and GHG flux enhancement measurements, or determined whether the creditable offset benefit can finance the restoration. We measured all of the necessary GHG accounting parameters in the 7-km^2 Zostera marina (eelgrass) meadow in Virginia, U.S.A., part of the largest, most cost-effective meadow restoration to date, to provide the first seagrass offset finance test-of-concept. Restoring seagrass removed 9,600 tCO_2 from the atmosphere over 15 years but also enhanced both CH_4 and N_2O production, releasing 950 tCO_2e. Despite tripling the N_2O flux to 0.06 g m^−2 yr^−1 and increasing CH_4 8-fold to 0.8 g m^−2 yr^−1, the meadow now offsets 0.42 tCO_2e ha^−1 yr^−1, which is roughly equivalent to the seagrass sequestration rate for GHG inventory accounting but lower than the rates for temperate and tropical forests. The financial benefit for this highly successful project, $87 K at $10 MtCO_2e^−1, defrays ~10% of the restoration cost. Managers should also consider seagrass co-benefits, which provide additional incentives for seagrass restoration.",2020-04-30,10.1038/s41598-020-64094-1,"['Oreska, Matthew P.

1910,Biochar Technology for Environmental Sustainability,"Biochar has been indicated as an amendment to degrade soils, improve carbon sequestration and increase agronomic productivity and future carbon trading markets. Intensive research has confirmed that biochar is part of the carbon with variable properties due to the result of production, e.g. feedstock and pyrolysis conditions and other factors like storage and transportation. Agronomic benefits from biochar additions to degrade soils have been emphasized. Soils are complex mixtures of solids, liquids, gases and living organisms, and adding biochar can change their physical, chemical and biological properties in several different ways. The research started to show which soil and biochar properties are responsible for these changes and to use them to improve crop growth and soil amendment or for environmental management. People are hopeful about the positive agronomic effects from potential biochar usage on climate impacts, but there is a lot still to be done. Biochar can be produced at scales ranging from individual farm to large industrial level making it appropriate to a variety of socioeconomic situations. Various pyrolysis technologies are commercially available that yield different proportions of biochar and bioenergy products. The bio-oil produced may be used directly for low-grade heating applications and as a diesel substitute after suitable treatment. Pyrolysis processes consist of two major types, fast and slow, which refer to the speed at which the biomass is altered. Fast pyrolysis, with biomass residence times of a few seconds, generates more bio-oil and less biochar than slow pyrolysis. Slow process for which biomass residence time can range from hours to days. Also biochar produced from wood shavings is likely to be different from a biochar produced from dairy cow manure. The application of biochar on a worldwide basis has been undertaken to clearly understand ramifications in adapting the biochar technology. The challenges that are unique to regions in terms of physical, economic and chemical natures are taken up to devise future plans for this fascinating innovation in soil amendment and climate mitigation.

1912,Synergy potential between climate change mitigation and forest conservation policies in the Indonesian forest sector: implications for achieving multiple sustainable development objectives,"There has been growing interest in achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by identifying effective interactions or synergy potential among measures/policies on sustainable development. The simultaneous implementation of climate change mitigation (SDG 13) and forest protection (SDG 15) is an example of an interaction where the measures/policies that contribute to both goals can be identified and the overlaps eliminated. However, there are limited studies that quantitatively evaluate the synergy potential in the forest sector. This study is the first attempt to examine the synergy potential in the forest sector in Indonesia focusing on climate change mitigation and forest protection. We evaluated four scenarios that differentiated climate and forest policy options and assessed the effectiveness of implementing these two policies simultaneously by 2030, using a computable general equilibrium model and a land-use model. We found that the additional efforts needed for emission reduction were larger for the scenario not considering forest protection than for that considering forest protection. This caused differences in the mitigation measures introduced and the resulting land use that depended on the scenario. Consequently, mitigation costs would be reduced by implementing mitigation and forest protection policies simultaneously, suggesting that the synergy effect in the forest sector in Indonesia does exist. This also implies simultaneous contributions to SDGs 13 and 15 (Targets 13.2 and 15.2). To realize such synergies, which have not yet been considered, it is necessary for policymakers to fill the institutional gaps between the policies/strategies of mitigation and forest conservation and enforce the policies for SDGs.",2019-11-01,10.1007/s11625-018-0650-6,"['Matsumoto, Ken’ichi', 'Hasegawa, Tomoko', 'Morita, Kanako', 'Fujimori, Shinichiro']",Sustainability Science,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11625-018-0650-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1913,"Microbial anaerobic digestion: process dynamics and implications from the renewable energy, environmental and agronomy perspectives","Microorganisms have been allied with serious deleterious environmental, human and public health hazards. Microbial interactions are vital in the biotransformation of wastes to valuable end products via the waste-to-energy technology. Microbial anaerobic degradation has been considered as a powerful tool to address the shortcomings faced by conventional energy sources (e.g. the conventional energy sources are non-renewable, can deplete over time and are very costly). It is the anaerobic breakdown of organic wastes within the precincts of an airtight biodigester, by the concerted activities of four metabolically linked microorganisms participating at specific phases of the process to ultimately yield methane and carbon dioxide. Microorganisms are present in these wastes from animal origin, feeds or during collection of the wastes for disposal. The threefold benefit of the process includes: firstly, sanitization of the organic wastes whereby the pathogens of environmental and public health significance can be reduced to threshold levels recommended for safe handling by humans. Also, it addresses the pollution problem caused by greenhouse gas emission. Secondly, the recovered digestate contains macro- and micronutrients that are valuable for plant growth. Soil amendment with digestate influences the microbial activity, the microbial biomass structure and the size which in turn improve on soil fertility and quality thus, improve on food security. Clearly, this minimizes the use of synthetic chemical fertilizers with adverse effects.

1914,California's success in the socio-ecological practice of a forest carbon offset credit option to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions,"The mitigation of climate change through the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions has become a central goal of international policy. An estimated 27 cap-and-trade programs to reduce carbon emissions exist worldwide. But only a small number of them use a forest carbon offset credit option. In 2012, California created a forest carbon offset credit option as part of its greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program. The offset credits have come primarily from US forests that meet requirements for additional, verifiable increases in carbon storage through improved forest management. California, with the help of its cap-and-trade program and modest carbon offset option, has met its initial goal for lower carbon emissions. This case study reveals a gap in socio-ecological practice research on a forest carbon offset credit option by identifying seven measures of success. These seven measures show how a forest carbon offset credit option can enhance a cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Countries and regions that are using or contemplating the use of a forest carbon offset credit option can employ these seven measures to design, evaluate, or upgrade their forest carbon offset programs.",2019-06-01,10.1007/s42532-019-00017-3,"['Kim, Chaeri', 'Daniels, Thomas']",Socio-Ecological Practice Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s42532-019-00017-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1915,Design principles for protected area certificates: a case study on strategic investor groups,"Biological capacity of earth is limited. While it is obvious at first glance, it has been ignored for decades. Policy makers attempt to overcome the persistent depletion of the human livelihood base through the establishment of protected areas. However, the financial means to sustainably manage a representative network of protected areas on a global scale do not yet exist, and particularly, private sector investment is extremely modest. One option for increasing private investment flows is the development of a market place for protected area certificates (PACs) issued for geographical areas managed according to social and environmental best practices. This paper utilizes semi-structured expert interviews with 39 German companies to analyze major product and market requirements for the sound implementation of an international certification scheme for PACs. Based on a triangulation approach that combines quantitative and qualitative evaluations with the two-step clustering procedure for strategic investor groups, seven design principles are determined that might encourage voluntary investment funds from the private sector, and thus support the sustainable management of protected areas. Having a look at existing markets for protected areas, one scheme provides a good foundation for the defined design principles: the LifeWeb initiative—an online clearing house for protected area developers and potential investors.",2019-02-15,10.1007/s10668-017-0038-2,"['Meißner, Nathalie', 'Winter, Etti']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-017-0038-2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer

Based on the concept of blue carbon ecosystems advocated by the United Nations Environment Programme, since 2011 Yokohama City has been conducting a social experiment called the Yokohama Blue Carbon Project, which serves to counter climate change and includes a novel carbon offset campaign. Yokohama City, which was chosen by the Japanese government as an environmental Future City in countering global warming, is aiming to transition from being a port city to a marine environmental city.

The capability of net uptake of atmospheric CO_2 and soil organic carbon accumulation in global shallow coastal ecosystems are estimated to be about 1070 Tg C year^−1 and about 140 Tg C year^−1, respectively, with considerably large variabilities and uncertainties. Next, we discuss future needs for scientific and technological progress to constrain these large variabilities and uncertainties. We then review how blue carbon is being discussed at international conferences and within frameworks on climate change. Finally, we discuss how conserving, restoring, and utilizing blue carbon ecosystems can meet social needs in the future.

1918,Climate Policies as Water Policies,"This study uses an updated version of the U.S. Agricultural Resource Model (USARM)—a multi-region U.S. agricultural sector programming model—to examine effects of climate change mitigation policies on U.S. water resources. One scenario considers effects of increasing prices of energy and energy-intensive inputs (primarily fertilizers) through a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program. A second scenario combines the first scenario with an agricultural offset program where farmers are paid to retire cropland for carbon sequestration. The consequences of climate mitigation policies for agricultural water use and pollution control have received relatively little attention in part because—unlike USARM—many national agricultural sector models do not explicitly include water as an input. USARM also allows for input substitution among seven inputs in a CES framework, while accounting for all major crops as well most specialty crops, federal commodity programs, and crop exports. Major results are as follows. First, climate mitigation policies have scope to significantly reduce agricultural water use. Whether domestic offsets are included has little effect on the total amount of water conserved, but has a large effect on which parts of the country the conservation takes place. Second, either carbon taxes or cap-and-trade combined with domestic offsets combines two policies often modeled as potential solutions to the hypoxic “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico—increased fertilizer prices and land retirement. Climate policies may have unanticipated, near-term, environmental benefits by addressing the hypoxia problem. Third, while domestic offsets reduce total fertilizer and agricultural chemical use, they increase their use per acre. Particularly in watersheds with significant land retirement, there could be unintended intensive margin effects where fertilizer and chemical use are increased. Despite this last, cautionary finding, a key insight into decision makers is that climate policies can have unanticipated, near-term benefits of water pollution control and water conservation that could be included in benefit-cost analyses of climate policy proposals.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-13487-7_11,"['Konyar, Kazim', 'Frisvold, George']",Applied Methods for Agriculture and Natural Resource Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-13487-7_11,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer

United Nations (UN) and member states reached a cooperative framework for combating climate change by reaching such legal agreements the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement identifies the objective and blueprint for global low-carbon development and heralds the arrival of global low-carbon era. Implementing the Paris Agreement and practically promoting low-carbon green development have become a major task for all countries.

1920,Hypothesis for a Risk Cost of Carbon: Revising the Externalities and Ethics of Climate Change,"Standard market-based policies for addressing climate change mostly aim to internalize the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) into the economy with either carbon taxes or cap-and-trade schemes. Standard policies are failing to manage the systemic risk of dangerous-to-catastrophic climate change for a variety of reasons. In this chapter we clarify and expand on a market hypothesis that argues for a second externalized cost of carbon, called the Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC), as the appropriate solution to this risk problem. The combination of the SCC and RCC creates a new paradigm of complementary market pricing for the dual objectives of improving market efficiency and managing systemic risk, respectively. Introducing the RCC addresses the problem of how to decouple gross world product (GWP) from carbon emissions and how to solve the paradox of time discounting under systemic risk. Subsequently the RCC could have major implications for climate change economics, public policy, and sustainability theory. The hypothesis is novel by taking into consideration both the entropy and the mass of the carbon budget. The RCC is technically defined as the cost of imposing risk tolerances (%) on climate mitigation objectives, and it has units of USD per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO_2e) mitigated. The RCC is internalized with a “global carbon reward” that manages a trade-off between market efficiency and climate certainty. The carbon reward is issued as a parallel currency and with an exchange rate that is managed by central banks over a rolling 100-year planning horizon. A key recommendation is to test the hypothesis with experiments.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-03152-7_8,"['Chen, Delton B.', 'Beek, Joel', 'Cloud, Jonathan']",Understanding Risks and Uncertainties in Energy and Climate Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-03152-7_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer

1922,"Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation in Africa: Strategies, Synergies, and Constraints","This chapter uses data on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to examine the nature of climate change mitigation and adaptation actions being pursued in African countries and assesses the extent to which preferred mitigation and adaptation priorities advance the cause of sustainable development on the continent. The prospective synergies between mitigation and adaptation approaches and sustainable development are assessed. Also, the pathways through which resource constraints and institutional and policy environment affect Africa’s ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change are examined, as well as the degree to which these constraints are being addressed. It is argued that Africa’s ability to benefit from sustainable development synergies embedded in the mitigation and adaptation strategies in the INDCs will be greatly limited by institutional and policy environment that hinders funding, capacity building, and technological innovation systems development. The slow pace of efforts to address these impediments further erodes confidence that climate adaptation in Africa will be effective at sufficiently contributing to a reduction in climate change risks to the continent.",2019-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-02662-2_11,"['Nyiwul, Linus M.']",Climate Change and Global Development,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-02662-2_11,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer

1925,Global Warming and Carbon Sequestration in Africa’s Forests: Potential Rewards for New Policy Directions in the Congo Basin,"The Congo forest is not only an important biodiversity hotspot, providing direct ecosystem goods and services for the livelihood of more than 50 million people, it is also of global importance holding almost 10% of the world’s forest-based carbon thus acting as the planet’s second lung after the Amazon and providing a carbon-sink potential to mitigate global warming. This potential strategically positions the countries in the region in the climate change negotiations aimed to enhance forests’ capacity for sequestering carbon. These countries in turn rely heavily on forest ecosystem goods and services to catalyse economic development. The dilemma for policy is to manage the trade-off between exploitation and conservation of forests under new initiatives such as the REDD+ (reduce emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and foster conservation). Given also that countries within the basin stand to benefit from the emerging global carbon market, if correct measures are taken in managing existing natural resources, and being active participants in the international climate change negotiations, natural resource managers and forest policy makers would have to take measures to promote the sequestration of carbon in forest biomass while accounting for forest exploitation.

1926,Incorporating Carbon and Bioenergy Concerns Into Forest Management,"Purpose of Review The primary focus of this paper is to review articles that incorporate forest carbon sequestration or bioenergy into an optimization framework for forest management at the stand and forest levels and to highlight the gaps in the literature. Forest management is seen as a cost-effective strategy to reduce carbon emission, and optimization techniques are a powerful tool to assist in developing an optimal strategy. Recent Findings Our review of literature shows a gap in research on the use of optimal management schemes to investigate the impact of silvicultural techniques such as site preparation, genetic improvement, and fertilization on carbon sequestration. For operational planning, spatial information is helpful in developing an optimal mitigation strategy. However, there is a gap in literature when it comes to the application of exact solution techniques to solve spatially constrained harvest scheduling problems that encourage carbon sequestration and timber production, while taking into account forest management prescriptions. The review further shows that assessing the impacts of using carbon sequestration and bioenergy strategies to mitigate the impact of greenhouse gas-induced climate change is complex due to the interaction between the forest sector, energy, and other industrial product sectors. Summary We suggest that more research should be directed towards using optimization techniques and an integrated system approach that tracks carbon flow in multiple sectors as a strategy to reduce carbon emissions. This strategy should encourage higher wood utilization and increase use of long-lived harvested wood products as well as bioenergy from waste wood.",2018-09-01,10.1007/s40725-018-0080-9,"['Yoshimoto, Atsushi', 'Asante, Patrick', 'Itaka, Shizu']",Current Forestry Reports,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s40725-018-0080-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1927,Beyond opportunity costs: who bears the implementation costs of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation?,"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) in developing countries is based on the premise that conserving tropical forests is a cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions and therefore can be fully funded by international actors with obligations or interests in reducing emissions. However, concerns have repeatedly been raised about whether stakeholders in REDD+ host countries will actually end up bearing the costs of REDD+. Most prior analyses of the costs of REDD+ have focused on the opportunity costs of foregone alternative uses of forest land. We draw on a pan-tropical study of 22 subnational REDD+ initiatives in five countries to explore patterns in implementation costs, including which types of organizations are involved and which are sharing the costs of implementing REDD+. We find that many organizations involved in the implementation of REDD+, particularly at the subnational level and in the public sector, are bearing implementation costs not covered by the budgets of the REDD+ initiatives. To sustain this level of cost-sharing, REDD+ must be designed to deliver local as well as global forest benefits.",2018-02-01,10.1007/s11027-016-9736-6,"['Luttrell, Cecilia', 'Sills, Erin', 'Aryani, Riza', 'Ekaputri, Andini Desita', 'Evinke, Maria Febe']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-016-9736-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1928,Payments for Ecosystem Services,"Payments for ecosystem services come in several different conservation financing instruments such as biodiversity offsets, species banking, watershed protection payments, mitigation banking, and forest carbon markets, particularly Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). The “+” in REDD+ includes REDD along with forest conservation, sustainable forest management, and the enhancement of carbon stocks. The author presents an historical overview, provides more details on the mechanisms, presents four case studies, and then undertakes both a financial analysis and a policy analysis, along with a future outlook. The 4 case studies are the Purus Project, the Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve REDD+ Project, the Kasigau Wildlife Corridor REDD Project—Phase I Rukinga Sanctuary, and the Rio Tinto QMM Biodiversity Offset Project. The Purus Project is the first private REDD+ project in Acre, Brazil—which is widely seen as the leading subnational jurisdiction working on REDD+-related initiatives—to achieve dual validation and verification to the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard (CCBS) with Gold Distinction. The Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve REDD+ Project is located on the island of Borneo within the Central Kalimantan province of Indonesia. The Project was the first REDD+ project in the world to be validated to the VCS and also the first REDD+ project in the world to achieve Triple Gold validation under the CCBS. Furthermore, this was the first REDD+ project to be approved in Indonesia and addresses all 17 of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Kasigau Wildlife Corridor REDD Project—Phase I Rukinga Sanctuary is the first VCS REDD+ project to complete verification and issuance. The Project is located in Kenya between Tsavo West and Tsavo East National Parks. The Project is in the process of reducing 7.5 million mtCO_2e over the first 30 years and helped spur additional projects. The Rio Tinto QMM Biodiversity Offset Project is located in Madagascar.

1929,Carbon Money,"While we have made some recent progress in the direction of creating a new system of climate finance, the latter would be greatly boosted if linked to a new type of money directly funding carbon mitigation. We see first preliminary manifestations of such carbon money, notably three different kinds of international emission-reduction certificates issued under the Kyoto and Paris accords as a sort of carbon credit as well as privately traded carbon offsets Carbon offsets . The booming trend toward cryptocurrencies, fueled by the transformative blockchain Blockchain technology, opens the way for digital carbon tokens as a potentially useful new carbon-money category. But we can also envisage a much more deeply embedded system of carbon money at the center of eco-capitalism, by means of fully monetized carbon certificates Carbon certificates, as money entering the banking system.

1930,Importance of Soils of Agroecosystems for Climate Change Policy,"Until now, international climate change Climate change policy has neglected the potential of agroecosystems to contribute to climate change Climate change mitigation by reduction in net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and by enhancing soil inorganic carbon Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and soil organic carbon Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration. Proven agricultural practices for creating a positive soil C balance such as those under the umbrella of climate-smart agriculture Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) are readily available. In the future, the importance of soil C stocks for climate change Climate change mitigation will be addressed by the target of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and land- and soil-related targets for achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Further, many nationally determined contributions (NDCs) submitted to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Climate change (UNFCCC) after the 2015 Paris Agreement include references to soil enhancement and to the necessity of better soil management practices. Similarly, an ambitious goal to increase global soil C stocks of managed agricultural land by 0.4% per year in the topsoil was set by the ‘4 Per 1000 Initiative 4 Per 1000 Initiative : Soils for Food Security and Climate’ (4p1000). Based on this, spatially diversified strategies need to be developed to sequester SOC in agroecosystems by addressing limitations imposed by nutrient (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus) availability, and due consideration of economic and social aspects. Thus, meaningful actions that help to restore and protect soils of agroecosystems including their SOC stocks have been initiated recently. It is hoped that soils of agroecosystems will increasingly be managed to address climate climate change Climate change while at the same time contributing to food security under increasing pressure from population growth and dietary changes. This chapter begins with an overview over some practices to enhance soil C stocks in agroecosystems for climate and food security. This is followed by a description of previously proposed climate change Climate change mitigation policies and their reference to agroecosystems soil C stocks. Then, a brief overview over CSA, carbon farming Carbon Farming , and the soil security Soil Security framework is given.

1932,Green Procurement Models,"Green procurement models are often premised on obtaining commodities that have been independently verified against a sustainability certification such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). In addition, there are numerous networks and roundtables such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, and the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS). More recently, there has been the emergence of zero deforestation supply chain commitments from many of the world’s largest private and publicly traded companies. The author presents an historical overview, provides details on the mechanisms, presents 3 case studies, and then undertakes both a financial analysis and a policy analysis, along with a future outlook. The 3 case studies are the Deramakot and Ulu Segama-Malua Forest Reserves of Malaysia, REDD Project in Brazil Nut Concessions in Madre de Dios, Peru, and Project Piaba with the New England Aquarium (Amazonas, Brazil). The Deramakot and Ulu Segama-Malua Forest Reserves, located in Malaysia, demonstrate that well-managed, sustainable logging operations are a key conservation strategy when focused on a landscape level. These Reserves undertake both intensive forest restoration of indigenous tree species and apply site-species matching, which are conducted via both line planting and gap planting. Collectively, these Reserves provide habitat for the largest population of Borneo orangutans in Malaysia. The REDD Project in Brazil Nut Concessions in Madre de Dios, Peru, is a project that involves approximately 400 families, and in total, the Project is approximately 300,000 hectares and is conserving some of the world’s richest tropical rainforest. Project Piaba is a unique and ambitious initiative conserving the tropical rainforests of Amazonas, Brazil, by generating alternative income for local communities via the aquarium trade, particularly the trade in a species of fish known as cardinal tetras. While the cardinal tetras make up as much as 80% of the region’s aquarium fish exports, 245 species are endemic to this area and are on the approved list of species for export. If not for the dedication of Project Piaba to help maintain and improve the aquarium trade, the local communities would likely adopt other, non-sustainable land use practices and the surrounding forests would be lost forever.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-63236-0_15,"['McFarland, Brian Joseph']",Conservation of Tropical Rainforests,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-63236-0_15,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer

1934,Tax Deductions and Conservation Easements,"Tax deductions and conservation easements are a financing mechanism for the conservation of tropical rainforests. As opposed to the more traditional approach where governments raise conservation finance through taxation, there is also the ability for local entities to utilize a tax deduction to raise conservation finance. Oftentimes, this use of a tax deduction for conservation purposes is for the establishment of a conservation easement or to encourage donations to an eligible nonprofit organization which has a conservation-related mission.

The 3 case studies are Brazil’s Forest Code and the creation of Legal Reserve Credits, the Naranjitos Conservation Easements in Guatemala, and the Yela Forest Conservation Easement. Brazil’s Forest Code and the creation of Legal Reserve Credits are not a traditional conservation easement in the sense that the landowner receives a tax deduction. However, a landowner in Brazil may be eligible to effectively place a lien on their property and transfer the rights to the excess forest cover to another landowner who has a deficit in forest cover in exchange for compensation. The Naranjitos Conservation Easements in Guatemala is a successful example of structuring a conservation easement deal for 2 parcels known as the Naranjitos, which would become a part of the greater Maya Biosphere Reserve. The Maya Biosphere Reserve and the adjacent landscape known as the Selva Maya Initiative form the largest contiguous rainforest north of the Amazon. The Yela Forest Conservation Easement case study is another successful example of utilizing a conservation easement to help conserve tropical forests. In fact, this was one of the first conservation easements structured outside of the Americas, the easement has a unique feature that provides for perpetual financing, and the easement is helping to protect the largest remaining ka forest in the world.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-63236-0_8,"['McFarland, Brian Joseph']",Conservation of Tropical Rainforests,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-63236-0_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1935,An economic assessment of local farm multi-purpose surface water retention systems in a Canadian Prairie setting,"There is a need to explore more sustainable approaches to water management on the Canadian Prairies. Retention pond installation schemes designed to capture surface water may be a viable option that would reduce water stress during drought periods by providing water for irrigation. The retention systems would serve to capture excess spring runoff and extreme rainfall events, reducing flood potential downstream. Additionally, retention ponds may be used for biomass production and nutrient retention. The purpose of this research was to investigate the economic viability of adopting local farm surface water retention systems as a strategic water management strategy. A retention pond was analyzed using a dynamic simulation model to predict its storage capacity, installation and upkeep cost, and economic advantage to farmers when used for irrigation. While irrigation application increased crop revenue, the cost of irrigation and reservoir infrastructure and installation costs were too high for the farmer to experience a positive net revenue. Farmers who harvest cattails from retention systems for biomass and available carbon offset credits can gain $642.70/hectare of harvestable cattail/year. Cattail harvest also removes phosphorus and nitrogen, providing a monetized impact of $7014/hectare of harvestable cattail/year. The removal of phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, and avoided flooding damages of the retention basin itself provide an additional $17,730–$18,470/hectare of retention system/year. The recommended use of retention systems is for avoided flood damages, nutrient retention, and biomass production. The revenue gained from these functions can support farmers wanting to invest in irrigation while providing economic and environmental benefits to the region.",2017-12-01,10.1007/s13201-017-0592-7,"['Berry, Pamela', 'Yassin, Fuad', 'Belcher, Kenneth', 'Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich']",Applied Water Science,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13201-017-0592-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1936,Mangrove and Freshwater Wetland Conservation Through Carbon Offsets: A Cost-Benefit Analysis for Establishing Environmental Policies,"Mexico has extensive coastal wetlands (4,243,137 ha), and one of its most important sites is the Alvarado Lagoon System, located in the Papaloapan River Basin on the Gulf of Mexico. The land cover dedicated to livestock and sugarcane has increased: by 25 % in 2005 and 50 % in 2010, with a loss of wetland vegetation and the carbon that it stores. We found that the Net Present Value of mangrove carbon offsets profit is equal to $5822.71, that of broad-leaved marshes is $7958.86, cattail marshes $5250.33, and forested wetlands $8369.41 per hectare, during a 30-year-carbonoffset contract. However, the opportunity cost from conserving wetland instead of growing sugarcane is positive according to REDD+ methodology, e.g., broad-leaved marsh conservation ranged from $6.73 to $20 USD/t CO2e, that of cattail marshes from $12.20 to $32.65 USD/t CO2e, and forested wetlands from $7.15 to $20.60 USD/t CO2e, whereas the opportunity cost between conservation and livestock was negative, it means that conservation is more profitable. The cost-benefit analysis for assessing investment projects from a governmental perspective is useful to determine the viability of conserving coastal wetlands through carbon offset credits. It also shows why in some areas it is not possible to conserve ecosystems due to the opportunity cost of changing from one economic activity (livestock and sugarcane) to carbon offsets for protecting wetlands. Furthermore, it allows for a comparison of carbon markets and assessment in terms of REDD+ and its methods for determining the social cost per ton of carbon avoided.",2017-02-01,10.1007/s00267-016-0790-3,"['Vázquez-González, César', 'Moreno-Casasola, Patricia', 'Hernández, María Elizabeth', 'Campos, Adolfo', 'Espejel, Ileana', 'Fermán-Almada, José Luis']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-016-0790-3,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1937,The adaptation and mitigation potential of traditional agriculture in a changing climate,"The threat of global climate change has caused concern among scientists because crop production could be severely affected by changes in key climatic variables that could compromise food security both globally and locally. Although it is true that extreme climatic events can severely impact small farmers, available data is just a gross approximation at understanding the heterogeneity of small scale agriculture ignoring the myriad of strategies that thousands of traditional farmers have used and still use to deal with climatic variability. Scientists have now realized that many small farmers cope with and even prepare for climate change, minimizing crop failure through a series of agroecological practices. Observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to the high level of on-farm biodiversity, a typical feature of traditional farming systems. Based on this evidence, various experts have suggested that rescuing traditional management systems combined with the use of agroecologically based management strategies may represent the only viable and robust path to increase the productivity, sustainability and resilience of peasant-based agricultural production under predicted climate scenarios. In this paper we explore a number of ways in which three key traditional agroecological strategies (biodiversification, soil management and water harvesting) can be implemented in the design and management of agroecosystems allowing farmers to adopt a strategy that both increases resilience and provides economic benefits, including mitigation of global warming.",2017-01-01,10.1007/s10584-013-0909-y,"['Altieri, Miguel A.', 'Nicholls, Clara I.']",Climatic Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10584-013-0909-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1938,Green and sustainable remediation practices in Federal Agency cleanup programs,"Federal agencies manage hazardous waste sites under the assumption that environmental restoration will improve the environment by returning contaminated groundwater to beneficial use, removing waste residuals from a site, treating discharges to surface water, and reducing overall risks to human health and the environment. However, the associated time-consuming and expensive operations, extensive performance monitoring, and post-closure care can lead to unanticipated environmental impacts due to both the technological nature of these cleanup activities and the related protracted timelines. These life-cycle impacts can and should be included in the evaluation of remedial alternatives. Increasingly, Federal agencies are considering these life-cycle impacts—variously referred to as “environmental footprint analysis,” “sustainable remediation,” “green remediation,” “greener remediation,” and “green and sustainable remediation”—when evaluating environmental restoration approaches. For the purposes of this paper, this concept will be referred to as “green and sustainable remediation” (GSR), with application of GSR assumed to take place across the cleanup life cycle, from the investigation phase through site closeout. This paper will discuss the history of GSR, what GSR is, who is implementing GSR, and GSR metrics. The paper will also discuss two approaches to GSR, using case studies to understand and implement it; the first will be a qualitative approach, and the second a more detailed quantitative approach.",2016-10-27,10.1007/s12665-016-6219-8,"['Martino, Louis E.', 'Dona, Carol L.', 'Dicerbo, Jerry', 'Hawkins, Amy', 'Moore, Beth', 'Horner, Robert']",Environmental Earth Sciences,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s12665-016-6219-8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1939,Green economy and carbon markets for conservation and development: a critical view,"Green economy aims to use economic rationality and market mechanisms to mute the most ecologically damaging effects of globalized capitalism while reviving economic growth in the global North, fostering development in the South, and decoupling economic growth from environmental decline. An archetypal application of green economy is transnational trade in ecosystem services, including reduced emissions for deforestation and degradation (REDD+). By compensating developing countries for maintaining forests as carbon sinks, this approach is meant to transcend politics and circumvent conflicts over the responsibilities of industrialized and ‘less-developed’ countries that have stymied global climate policy. However, carbon-offset trading is unlikely to result in lower greenhouse gas emissions, much less combined conservation and development gains. The troubled record of payment for environmental services and other schemes or commodification of nature illustrates that living ecosocial systems do not fit the requirements of market contracts. Disputes over proto-REDD+ projects point to the dangers that REDD+ will disadvantage or dispossess rural communities and distract attention from underlying causes of forest and livelihood loss. Two decades of all-but-futile climate negotiations have shown that global warming cannot be managed by means of technocratic expertise nor dealt with separately from the politics of inequality and the paradox of economic growth. The deceptive promise of greening with growth can blind us to these realities. Counter-hegemonic discourses to growth-centered green economy under the headings of buen vivir , mainly in the global South, and degrowth , mainly in the global North, therefore merit attention.",2016-06-01,10.1007/s10784-015-9295-4,"['McAfee, Kathleen']","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10784-015-9295-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1940,Plant Species Effects on the Carbon Storage Capabilities of a Blanket bog Complex,"Plants are known to influence peatland carbon fluxes both i) directly through respiration and ii) by the production of litter and root exudates, which are then broken down by microbes within the peat matrix. In this study we investigated whether three different plant species typical of a UK blanket bog complex - Calluna vulgaris , Juncus effusus and mixed Sphagnum species - influence the carbon sequestering abilities of the peat that they grow in. To quantify this we measured fluxes of soil derived CO_2 and CH_4, and extractable levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and phenolics, from peat samples taken from areas dominated by one of the three plant communities. It was found that there were significant differences between the carbon fluxes from the different sites, which we attributed to changes brought about by the vegetation on the pH, phenolic concentrations and extracellular enzyme activities found in the peat matrix. Peat taken from Sphagnum -dominated areas emitted less CO_2 than the other two sample groups, and had lower overall DOC concentrations and phenol oxidase activities. Conversely, Juncus -peat had the highest CO_2 and CH_4 fluxes, along with the greatest phenol oxidase activities. Taking all the results into consideration the plants were ranked in order of their ability to reduce the loss of carbon from the peat soil within which they were growing: Sphagnum  >  Calluna  >  Juncus . These results suggest that plant community structures could be altered in order to maximise a peatland’s ability to be used as a carbon store should they need to be managed as part of a carbon stewardship scheme or a geoengineering project – if this was to be the sole management interest in an area of peatland.",2016-02-01,10.1007/s13157-015-0714-7,"['Dunn, Christian', 'Jones, Timothy Graham', 'Roberts, Sally', 'Freeman, Chris']",Wetlands,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13157-015-0714-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1941,Linking the emissions trading schemes of Europe and China - Combining climate and energy policy instruments,"Both Europe and China have announced targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and renewable energy development. To achieve their emissions targets, Europe has introduced emissions trading scheme (ETS) since 2005 and China has planned to establish a national ETS in 2015. We assess the impact of a joint Europe-China ETS when both climate and energy policy instruments are simulated in a multiregional general equilibrium model. Our results show that a joint ETS markedly increases total carbon emissions from fossil fuels even though global mitigation costs are reduced. Moreover, a joint ETS helps China achieve its renewable energy target, but for Europe, it works opposite. While the renewable energy target does not help Europe achieve additional abatement, the renewable energy target in China reduces mitigation costs and emissions, and increases renewable energy consumption and sales of carbon allowances. Financial transfer through a joint ETS remains marginal compared to China’s demand for renewable energy subsidies. We conclude that as long as an absolute emissions cap is missing in China, a joint ETS is not attractive for mitigation and China’s renewable energy target can reduce emissions.",2016-02-01,10.1007/s11027-014-9580-5,"['Liu, Yang', 'Wei, Taoyuan']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-014-9580-5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer

1943,The Case for an Emissions-Trading System to Help Resolve the Climate Change Crisis,"To deal adequately with the climate change crisis, an emissions-regulating system is required to help resolve the following policy goals: (i) ecological sustainability—which requires, among other things, stabilising the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases at no more than 450 ppm of CO_2-e; (ii) distributional equity—which involves efforts to narrow the income gap between rich and poor and to ensure the needy have access to basic necessities; and (iii) allocative efficiency—which requires a price to be assigned to greenhouse gas emissions to induce a shift away from fossil fuels; maximise the use value generated from the emission of greenhouse gases; and encourage the development and use of greenhouse gas-abatement technologies. The system must also be designed to resolve these policy goals in the above order. It is argued in this chapter that these requirements can only be satisfied by implementing an emissions-trading system. There are, however, many observers who believe that an emissions-trading system is inferior to an emissions tax. The preference for an emissions tax is based on a number of assertions. Following a brief outline of the key features of an effective emissions-trading system, this chapter repudiates these assertions and explains the many advantages that emissions-trading systems have over emissions taxes. Because of market imperfections and non-market barriers, assigning a price to greenhouse gas emissions via an emissions-trading system does not guarantee the realisation of all economically viable abatement potential. In response, this chapter concludes with complementary forms of government intervention to help a nation cost-effectively achieve its emissions targets.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-94-017-7502-1_7,"['Lawn, Philip']",Resolving the Climate Change Crisis,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-017-7502-1_7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer

These diets are embedded in bio-cultural landscapes that are at risk from global markets, industrial agriculture, invasive species and climate change, and yet little research aimed at conserving this Mediterranean agricultural heritage is being conducted. A focus on preserving traditional Mediterranean agricultural systems provides unique opportunities to link UNESCO-SCBD’s Joint Programme on Biological and Cultural Diversity ( http://www.cbd.int/lbcd/ ) and FAO’s Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems initiative (GIAHS, http://www.fao.org/giahs/ ) with the goal of developing strategies and policy to preserve this heritage and the food production systems that are its basis for future generations. An important step in this direction is the development of holistic ecosystem-level assessments of the stability and resilience of traditional Mediterranean farming systems to evolving global change including climate change and shifting economic patterns and associated landscape transformations.

1945,"Changing Paradigms, Shifting Societal Discourses, and Organizational Responses","This chapter begins with a description of the transformational changes undertaken at the Portland Trail Blazers’ basketball arena campus when messages within their external environment changed to highlight environmental sustainability. Two paradigms generally used to describe the belief systems of people and people groups regarding our relationship with the natural environment are described: the dominant social paradigm and the new ecological paradigm. The societal shift toward the growing importance of the sustainable development Discourse within businesses, cities, and universities is described. Paradigms are differentiated from Discourses and ten environment-related Discourses are identified (i.e., the industrialism Discourse , survivalism, the Promethean response, administrative rationalism, democratic pragmatism, economic rationalism, green politics, green consciousness, ecological modernization, and sustainability). Criticisms of the ecological modernism and sustainability Discourses are reviewed. Communication’s role in reinforcing and challenging paradigms is discussed. The chapter ends by discussing forces which influence how environmentally related issues are framed, contested, and reframed. In addition to paradigms, Discourses , and ideology, theories or theoretical concepts highlighted include discursive closure, critical theory and the neo-Marxian perspective on sustainable development, framing, schemata of interpretation, systematically distorted communication, and social judgment theory. Throughout the chapter, interview data gathered from small businesses, an activist organization (the Natural Resources Defense Council), a nongovernmental organization, South Dakota’s state government, multiple cities (e.g., the City and County of Denver), two sports organizations (the Portland Trail Blazers, Aspen Skiing Company), a university, and two multinational organizations (Tyson Foods, Sam’s Club) is integrated.",2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-18005-2_2,"['Allen, Myria']",Strategic Communication for Sustainable Organizations,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-18005-2_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1946,Sustainability and Communication,"In response to growing global environmental problems and threats associated with global warming, organizations are recognizing that business-as-usual is no longer sufficient and that it is time to go to scale in responding to impending challenges. Effective communication is absolutely essential. Strategic communication is needed to alert, persuade, and help people enact sustainability initiatives within and between organizations. Strategic communication also orients our consciousness by inviting us to take a particular perspective, by evoking certain values and not others, and by creating referents for our attention and understanding. Sometimes effective communication is characterized by strategic ambiguity. Organizations face multiple challenges in terms of their sustainability-related communication. Some are silenced because of their fear of speaking out. For others, the messages they create are not processed because message recipients are unmotivated. Knowledge regarding the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion and the use of repetition are important tools when designing strategic communication. Communicators need to think critically about where their audience is in their understanding of sustainability and how to present information in an accessible way. Attention to message design and message framing can help.

1947,"Legitimacy, Stakeholders, and Strategic Communication Efforts","When organizational leaders undertake sustainability-related initiatives, they are concerned with whether or not their key stakeholders perceive their organization and its actions to be legitimate. In this chapter, legitimacy is defined, the types of legitimacy are described, the benefits of being seen as legitimate and having a positive reputation are discussed, and actions used to manage legitimacy are reviewed. Communication helps manage perceptions of the legitimacy of industries as well as individual organizations. Message credibility is important. Standardized communication directed simultaneously toward multiple internal and external stakeholders is discussed (i.e., annual public meetings, websites and sustainability reports, reporting frameworks, certifications, and architecture such as LEED-certified office buildings). Best practices are provided. The chapter reviews stakeholder theory and discusses the need to adapt messages to engage different stakeholders. In addition, theories or theoretical concepts highlighted include population ecology theory, resource dependency theory, institutional isomorphism, agency theory, normative discourse, the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion, actor–network theory, speech act theory, attribution theory, visual rhetoric, narrative theory, and organizational co-orientation theory.

1948,Valuing forestlands with stochastic timber and carbon prices,"We calculate expected bare land values, assuming forestry is the highest and best land use, using a real options methodology with stochastic mean-reverting timber and carbon prices. Land values relect the contribution of both timber as well as carbon stored in three separate pools—the forest, harvested wood products, and emissions avoided by using wood versus carbon-intensive substitute materials. Land values reflect one of three sequestration scenarios that vary the percentages of carbon sequestered in the three pools relative to the carbon sequestered in the forest just prior to the harvest activity. At harvest time, the value of the carbon sequestered in the three pools determines if the forest owner retains income gained from the sale of carbon credits, or must purchase credits to offset emissions associated with the harvest activity. A case study involving a hypothetical western Washington Douglas-fir stand suggests that carbon sequestration may be a significant income contribution for forest owners if the three carbon pools are recognized as credible offsets. However, the income contribution is sensitive to the amount of credit realized for carbon sequestered in each of the pools. The analysis demonstrates the significance of including carbon sequestered in the three separate pools when designing carbon offset policies.",2015-09-01,10.1007/s10479-013-1389-1,"['Petrasek, Stanislav', 'Perez-Garcia, John', 'Bare, B.

1953,Managerial Impediments to US Microgrid Development,"Conventional electric power plants are now being replaced by advanced microgrids at major military bases. This is a significant shift from purchase of a simple, fixed technological product to partnership with a service provider employing a flexible array of technologies that exploit a broad range of opportunities that will continue to change rapidly over a long period. The US military is currently leading the conversion to microgrids. Policy levers have been applied to make microgrids a success, including new contracting mechanisms, modified rules, ample funding, and political support. Everything appears to be in place, except that the underlying managerial culture is poorly matched to the opportunity. Habitual management and procurement practices have become an impediment, and policy levers have left this culture untouched. These practices grew from experience with the purchase of commodities and long-term fixed assets. While these practices continue to be workable in many situations, they tend to suppress complex, systemic, evolutionary programs for energy and resource management.

1954,Orchestration and transnational climate governance,"With multilateral efforts to mitigate climate change in gridlock, attention has turned to transnational climate governance initiatives, through which sub- and non-state actors seek to reduce greenhouse gases. These initiatives include networks of cities committed to lowering their carbon footprints, voluntary corporate reduction targets and disclosure processes, and many of the rules that govern carbon markets. The paper considers the role of “traditional” actors in world politics—states and intergovernmental organizations—in orchestrating such initiatives. This strategy accounts for nearly a third of transnational climate governance initiatives, we find, and upends the conventional dichotomy between “top down” and “bottom up” solutions to global collective action problems. We develop a theory to explain when states and intergovernmental organizations are likely to engage in orchestration, and we provide initial support for this theory with a new dataset of transnational climate governance initiatives and case studies of two of the most active orchestrators, the World Bank and the United Kingdom.",2014-03-01,10.1007/s11558-013-9174-0,"['Hale, Thomas', 'Roger, Charles']",The Review of International Organizations,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11558-013-9174-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1955,Maintaining and Enhancing Ecological Carbon Sequestration,"Terrestrial ecosystems sequester large amounts of organic carbon (C) in their pools of living and dead biomass. Management actions that increase C uptake and storage in ecological C pools, or that reduce C release from them, contribute to a society’s climate change mitigation objectives. They do this by reducing the rate of accumulation of CO_2 and its radiative equivalents in other greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. Trading systems for GHG credits recognize the validity of ecological offset projects that result in increased C storage in the living and/or dead organic matter of ecosystems. In some circumstances, projects that reduce C release from existing high-C ecosystems are also considered to provide legitimate offsets. Some ecological carbon-offset projects have been criticized from a variety of perspectives, but the problems can mostly be dealt with by means of improved regulations and management actions. In addition to their contribution to climate change mitigation, projects that maintain or accumulate ecological carbon offsets often result in important co-benefits through the conservation of biodiversity and non-carbon environmental services, which are also important societal goals. The co-benefits are, however, much less substantial for projects based on intensively managed ecosystems, such as no-till agroecosystems and plantation forests, compared with those that restore or maintain habitats that are more natural in character.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5784-4_12,"['Freedman, Bill']",Global Environmental Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5784-4_12,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1956,Rural Landscape Conservation in Japan: Lessons from the Satoyama Conservation Program in Kanagawa Prefecture,"Japanese call rural landscapes ‘ satoyama. ’ ‘ Sato ’ means village and ‘ yama’ means hill or forest. Satoyama in the past produced much of the food, wood for fuel, timber, and water for communities. However many satoyama have rapidly deteriorated due to industrialization and urbanization. It was in the 1990s that people in general and scientists began to recognize the multiple benefits of satoyama landscapes in Japan. This led to the proliferation of satoyama conservation groups across Japan at the turn of the century. However, it is difficult for local action groups to rehabilitate devastated farmlands and forests through their own efforts alone. It requires policy measures to encourage citizen engagement in satoyama conservation programs. In this paper the author addresses governance issues in rural landscape conservation, referring to the case of the satoyama conservation program in the Kanagawa region.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-4-431-54804-1_20,"['Koike, Osamu']",Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-4-431-54804-1_20,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1957,Advancing Forest-Related Adaptation: Options for Adaptation-Oriented REDD+,"The single most promising legal and political opportunity for simultaneously preserving tropical forests and combating climate change in the near future is the developing REDD+ mechanism (for summaries of REDD+ proposals see Parker et al. 2009). REDD+ has been understood primarily, if not exclusively, as a mitigation mechanism by most commentators because it has the potential to significantly reduce the nearly 20 % of global greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the forest and land use sector. However, as REDD+ becomes established, it will inevitably have a significant impact on adaptation in tropical forest regions. This impact will not necessarily be beneficial, but design choices made now—in the early stages of REDD+ development—can shape the mechanism to become a profoundly valuable instrument for advancing adaptation in tropical forest countries (for in-depth discussion see Long 2011; for a discussion focusing on biodiversity benefits see Long 2009).

1960,The significance of CSR in A/R CDM promotion from the case study of Japan: a focus on corporate forest-related activities and emission trading,"Today, all companies, irrespective of their industrial classification, have begun to accept approaches to environmental issues as a requirement of conducting business activities. Under such a condition, the CSR (corporate social responsibility) concept is gaining more attention. The CSR concept varies according to the individual country or region, and the period. This study targets the CSR in Japan. This paper intends to analyze and discuss corporate forest-related activities, emission trading and the relationship between A/R CDM (afforestation/reforestation clean development mechanism) and CSR based on the results obtained from the questionnaire. A/R CDM is the political measure based on the Kyoto Protocol to remove greenhouse gases by afforestation and reforestation projects in developing countries. The survey results are as follows: (1) about 60 % of companies responded as “CSR being a business opportunity” and “non-implementation of CSR being a business risk,” (2) 60–70 % of companies are involved in forest-related activities in some way, irrespective of industry, (3) a certain proportion of companies have purchased emission credits and have a high level of interest in carbon offsets, and (4) concerning A/R CDM, companies have a high recognition, but over 70 % of them are at the “information collecting stage” with regard to participation. In conclusion, CSR is insufficient as a driving force for A/R CDM promotion, but can suffice for promoting carbon offset-oriented forest-related activities.",2013-08-01,10.1007/s10310-012-0351-4,"['Fukushima, Takashi']",Journal of Forest Research,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10310-012-0351-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1961,Market Effects of Voluntary Climate Action by Firms: Evidence from the Chicago Climate Exchange,"Are private voluntary environmental actions by firms a sign of mismanagement, or a profitable “win-win” replacement for regulation? Empirical evidence is decidedly mixed. In this study, we use 19 years of monthly stock price returns, from 1991 to 2009, to examine the profitability of participation in CCX, a large voluntary greenhouse gas mitigation program. After controlling for systemic market risk as well as industry-specific shocks, we find statistically significant and positive excess returns for firms that announce their decision to join CCX. In addition, the progress of proposed greenhouse gas legislation (the Waxman–Markey bill) had a positive and large impact on excess returns for CCX member firms, suggesting that a major incentive for firms to join CCX may be to prepare for future regulation. Marginal abatement costs (proxied by the carbon price), on the other hand, were unrelated to excess returns. Our results imply that voluntary approaches should play a role in combating climate change, but that relying on them alone is not enough.",2013-06-01,10.1007/s10640-012-9626-7,"['Gans, Will', 'Hintermann, Beat']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-012-9626-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1962,Community Participation Mechanism: A Study of Youth Voices in Conservation’s GreenLeaf Marketplace,"This chapter focuses on international mechanisms for addressing climate change, focusing on linkages and multistakeholder communications, adaptations, and adoptions for greater sustainability. Since the Kyoto Protocol was organized, the idea of creating a carbon credit marketplace has been widely discussed. The United Nations has created a carbon credit certification process, and, at this point, there are a number of recognized evaluators for these credits. Unfortunately, the credit marketplace has substantially changed, and the availability of using this type of financial transaction for encouragement of developing countries to utilize their present initiatives to receive funds for their transition towards sustainability for which the developed countries and corporations would purchase these credits has failed. Failure in the sense that when funds are received by these developing countries, these funds are often diverted and actions towards a lower-carbon lifestyle have not been achieved. Conversely, a number of agencies have funded more localized projects that engage in developing sustainable actions in communities through improved mechanisms, such as sustainable forestry and agriculture and sustainable lifestyles including improved cooking stoves, water recycling, and waste recycling through biogas generation. Many of these projects at the point of achievement for their sustainability lack continued funding necessary to allow for sustainable development. The Youth Voices in Conservation Program has researched youth action towards conservation and sustainability from the classroom, the field site, and within nongovernmental and governmental organizational situations for the past few years. This research found that by developing a residual funding based upon carbon credit offsets created by these localized actions, there is a possibility of conditional cash transfer based upon these “good actions.” During the latter half of July 2011, intensive fieldwork in conjunction with UNDP-GEF Small Grants Projects and Center for Environment Education (CEE) occurred in India. Ten projects were evaluated for the establishment of an intranet/Internet evaluation mechanism that would allow for the development of the GreenLeaf Marketplace. Projects were also evaluated for their approach to reducing the carbon impact which correlated to the community financially, educationally, and environmentally. Detailed description of how this methodology works for developing financial environmental and financial communities will be discussed. It is hoped through a global mechanism that other localities throughout the world will be able to sign up through this computer-based system. The results of this research indicate that the Youth Voices in Conservation’s GreenLeaf Program may be able to address localized sustainability issues as well as methodology for decreasing carbon footprints and increasing financial sustainabilities within each community, and consequently, the environmental effects from the wide-scale adoption of these plans may be expected. It is anticipated that these credit mechanisms may be used with local bank issuance for green purposes with conditional cash transfer as part of the residual credit program.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-5995-4_8,"['Sonnenschein, Leonard']",Mechanism Design for Sustainability,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-5995-4_8,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1963,Avoiding Emissions Reduction: Terrestrial Carbon Sinks,"As noted in previous chapters, it is not easy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions – it is technically difficult and the public is willing to pay too little to do so. As a result, governments have looked to land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities as a means of removing CO_2 from the atmosphere and sequestering it in terrestrial carbon sinks. This chapter considers economic issues related to, among others, discounting of carbon, questions pertaining to additionality and leakage, transaction costs, the process of certifying carbon offset credits, governance, and corruption. Available data suggest that, compared to emissions reductions, LULUCF activities are a costly alternative for mitigating climate change, although forestry activities in some regions might constitute an exception. Carbon sequestration and its costs are examined over a number of forest rotations encompassing 240 years; costs and carbon uptake depend on tree species, growth rates, the post-harvest use of fiber, and the discount rate. As shown in this chapter, tree-planting activities can be used to earn certified emission reduction (CER) credits under Kyoto’s Clean Development Mechanism, but the approach used to determine the CER differs from the actual carbon flux. Finally, although currently not permitted under Kyoto, activities that Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) are being promoted as eligible CER credits. This effort has gone even further, however, in the attempt to link the UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) and the Convention on Biological Conservation – the definition of REDD credits has been extended to include sustainable management of forests, forest conservation and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks, collectively known as REDD+.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-4988-7_9,"['Kooten, G.

1965,Cost and Opportunities from Mitigation and Adaptation in Agriculture,"It has been predicted that even though efforts are made to reduce drastically the GHG emissions, climate change would still occur as it takes long time for climatic processes to respond. Thus, in addition to mitigation, adaptation to climate change equally plays an important role. Agriculture is one of such sectors that remain highly vulnerable to climate change. It is presumed that the least developed countries are the most susceptible ones due to their higher dependency on climate sensitive sector such as agriculture, and is expected to aggravate further the regional disparities. The international climate change regime designed Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) to help facilitate industrialized countries to meet their emission targets. Developing countries could be a part of it from where they can fulfill their dual purpose of fulfilling own responsibility of achieving sustainable development and at the same time earn income through carbon finance. Organic farming, bio-gas, System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and community forestry are some of the potential areas discussed where developing countries could take such opportunity.

1967,Impact of the Clean Development Mechanism on wind energy investments in Turkey,"Background As carbon trading continues to be implemented on both a national and an international scale, it is becoming an important factor in renewable energy investment decisions. Turkey, with continuous growth of carbon dioxide emission and energy consumption since 2001, ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2009 and began registration of projects with greenhouse gas reductions in 2010. In light of these developments, wind energy resources with a potential of 48,000 MW are among the most efficient and effective solutions for clean and sustainable energy in Turkey. The aim of our study is to reveal the importance of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol on wind energy investment decisions. Methods A broad review of wind energy in Turkey is given, and then, a comprehensive feasibility study of a wind energy firm with a valuation model including Certified Emission Reduction (CER) prices is applied to a case study, the Mega Metallurgy Power. With a holistic and interdisciplinary system engineering approach, results are obtained using comprehensive analysis of technology, emission, and power generation of a wind energy firm linked to a valuation model. Results This comprehensive model sets the investment decision-making criteria, the enterprise value comparison with total financing. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is run to show that the enterprise value is positively correlated with CER prices. Conclusions Based on these results, it is concluded that if the world's largest carbon offsetting program, the CDM, prevails after 2012, CER prices will have a positive impact on wind energy firm valuations and related investment decisions.",2012-10-15,10.1186/2192-0567-2-20,"['Tunç, Murat', 'Pak, Ruhan']","Energy, Sustainability and Society",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/2192-0567-2-20,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer

1969,United States Legislative Proposals on Forest Carbon,"This chapter provides an overview of the role of managing forests to store carbon in the efforts to adopt U.S. climate legislation at the national level (as of September 2010). While the U.S. has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol or adopted national climate legislation yet, considerable efforts have been underway to reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses at the regional (Northeastern U.S.), state (California), municipal, corporate, and individual levels. The issue of storage of carbon in forests and farmland has played a major role in U.S. emission reduction efforts, particularly in the voluntary carbon markets. As the demand for land-based carbon offsets has grown, so too has the demand for rules to define high quality, real offsets. The U.S. market has responded with a range of such rules, from those directly supported by governments, to those that are purely voluntary. Some of these rules cover how best to account for carbon in forest systems, such as: the types of forests/forestry operations covered; the pools of carbon in the forest that are included; the location of acceptable projects; and the “business as usual”/baseline emissions to be considered. Others go more directly to the quality of the offset produced, namely, whether the emission reductions are truly “additional” to those that would have happened anyway; how best to monitor and verify that the promised storage has occurred; how to protect against “ leakage; and how to ensure that the storage is permanent or how to protect against potential releases in the future.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-2232-3_16,"['Carlson, Jaime', 'Olivas, Ramon', 'Gentry, Bradford', 'Chiono, Anton']",Managing Forest Carbon in a Changing Climate,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-2232-3_16,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1970,Synthesis and Conclusions,"This chapter provides an overview of the role of tropical forests in the international efforts to negotiate a new global climate treaty. Under the existing treaty, the Kyoto Protocol and its “flexible mechanisms” – particularly the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) – have succeeded in building a billion dollar market for emission reduction projects in developing countries. Since the decision to include efforts to reduce emissions from tropical deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) in the 2007 Bali Action Plan, considerable attention has focused on designing a REDD and REDD+ program for inclusion in the next global climate agreement. The positions taken by different countries on REDD are driven by their circumstances – from those with large areas of standing forest to those with few remaining forests, from those facing rapid rates of deforestation to those engaged in reforestation. The overarching issues to be decided in developing the framework of a REDD mechanism include: the scope of the forestry activities to be covered; the scale of accounting for forestry activities and the baseline for measuring reference emissions levels; the type of financing to be provided for REDD activities; how to address fundamental issues of capacity and governance; and the consideration of co-benefits. There is some convergence around the scope of a REDD mechanism, the need to ultimately undertake activities at a national scale, the likelihood that financing will be both fund and market based, and the potential to implement REDD in phases. However, many contentious issues remain, including how to set baselines and accounting rules for REDD/REDD+ and how to incorporate governance concerns.",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-2232-3_18,"['Tyrrell, Mary L.', 'Ashton, Mark S.', 'Spalding, Deborah', 'Gentry, Bradford']",Managing Forest Carbon in a Changing Climate,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-2232-3_18,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1971,The Economic Drivers of Forest Land Use and the Role of Markets in the United States,"While forests in the U.S. have been both a net source and sink for CO_2 at different times throughout history, today they are a weak net carbon sink, largely as a result of changes in land use patterns over time. The capacity of forests to continue to serve as a carbon sink makes them potentially valuable as mitigation tools to offset the damaging effects of greenhouse gas emissions. However, policymakers must recognize that urbanization and development in the U.S. will continually pressure forests, leading to reduced forest cover and fragmented landscapes. From a purely economic standpoint, development is often the highest and best use of land, particularly if financial returns are the primary driver in land use decision-making. Finding the right balance between competing land uses has become an area of focus for economists and policymakers. As policymakers promote carbon strategies for U.S. forests, they should consider what is generally accepted in terms of the economic drivers of land use, and what is less well understood, as outlined below:",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-2232-3_15,"['Henke, Lisa', 'O’Brady, Caitlin', 'Spalding, Deborah', 'Tyrrell, Mary L.']",Managing Forest Carbon in a Changing Climate,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-2232-3_15,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1972,Global Consequences of the Bioenergy Greenhouse Gas Accounting Error,"Like the global financial crisis, which resulted in part from misguided accounting of mortgages, global policies to expand transportation biofuels and bioelectricity reflect an accounting error. Although the carbon accounting in these policies assumes that plant growth offsets all carbon released by burning biofuels, only “additional” plant growth can provide an offset. Because they double count biomass and land already used by people or sequestering carbon, many policy proposals aim for bioenergy to supply 20% or more of the world’s energy by 2050. That would require almost doubling the present global harvest of plants for all uses, which would likely lead to extensive deforestation and increase greenhouse gases.

1974,Adaptation and Mitigation,"In the ten years since the first National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change , the science and policy landscape for adaptation has evolved significantly. Adaptation is emerging as an essential strategy for managing climate risk and a broad range of adaptation initiatives are being pursued across a range of geopolitical scales. This interest in adaptation has emerged from an increased awareness that climate impacts are unavoidable (Wetherland et al., 2001); a growing availability of knowledge, data, and tools for the assessment of climate risk; and the interest of government agencies, businesses, and communities in increasing their resilience to both current climate variability as well as future climate change. However, adaptation strategies are not generally mainstreamed into the policy apparatus of governments or the development plans of the private sector; in other words, adaptation strategies supplement existing planning efforts but often involve an effort on their own rather than being integrated into existing management and policy regimes. Also, although adaptation planning has an increasingly rich portfolio of case studies contributing to shared learning (Gregg et al., 2011), the implementation of adaptation plans has proceeded at a much slower pace.",2012-01-01,10.5822/978-1-61091-460-4_5,"['Hansen, Lara', 'Beavers, Rebecca', 'Benoit, Jeff', 'Bowen, Diana', 'Cohen, Ellie', 'Craghan, Michael', 'Emmett-Mattox, Steve', 'Ferdana, Zach', 'Fletcher, Kristen', 'Gill, Stephen', 'Grannis, Jessica', 'Gregg, Rachel M.', 'Hoffman, Jennie', 'Holland, Brian', 'Johnson, Zoe', 'Preston, Benjamin L.', 'Marcy, Doug', 'Pahl, James', 'Raynie, Richard', 'Rozum, John']","Coastal Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerabilities",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.5822/978-1-61091-460-4_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1975,Estimating carbon supply curves from afforestation of agricultural land in the Northeastern U.S.,"The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for the northeastern states of the U.S. allows for terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration offsets generated by afforestation activities only. This paper estimates the maximum potential quantity and associated costs of increasing the storage of carbon by afforestation of existing agricultural land in the 11 states of the Northeast United States. The focus of the work was to describe location, the quantity, and at what cost it would be economically attractive to shift agricultural production to afforestation to increase carbon storage in the region. Widely available data sets were used to (1) identify spatially-explicit areas for lower costs carbon offsets and (2) estimate carbon supply curves related to afforestation of agricultural land over three time periods (10, 20, and 40 years). Carbon accumulation and total carbon offset project costs were estimated at a county scale and combined to identify expected costs per ton of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO_2e). Large variation in estimated costs per ton of CO_2e are driven by varying carbon accumulation potentials and opportunity costs of taking land out of agricultural production, as well as the duration of the project activity. Results show that the lowest cost carbon offset projects will be in certain counties of Maine, Vermont, and New York. Pasture land, with lower opportunity costs, generally presents the opportunity for lower cost carbon offset projects relative to cropland. This analysis estimates that afforestation of pasture land in the northeast will not become economically attractive until the price rises above $10 per metric tonne (MT) CO_2e and that up to 583 million MT could be economically sequestered if the price were to rise to $50 per MT CO_2e, based on a 40-year project life. With regard to cropland in the northeast, afforestation does not become economically advantageous for land owners until the price rises above $40 per MT CO_2e. It is estimated that up to 487,000 MT could be sequestered from cropland if the price were to rise to $50 per MT CO_2e, based on a 40-year project life.",2011-12-01,10.1007/s11027-011-9303-0,"['Winsten, Jonathan', 'Walker, Sarah', 'Brown, Sandra', 'Grimland, Sean']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-011-9303-0,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer

After early efforts to establish a successful commercial timber industry failed, recreation and ecosystem services came to dominate forestry policy objectives. Given Israel’s status as a ‘developing country’ under the Kyoto Protocol, forests’ economic potential through carbon sequestration has been explored, but has not yet proven to be compelling. Several considerations cooled initial enthusiasm for seeking international carbon credits through afforestation. These include administrative obstacles associated with international accreditation, limited potential economic profitability, and ethical considerations . Rather, a voluntary offsetting program was adopted, allowing donors to plant trees in Israel, that balance individual carbon emissions. Afforestation in drylands exhibit meaningful potential to counteract chronic carbon loss due to land degradation. As trees planted in Israel’s semi-arid regions exhibit surprisingly high carbon sequestration properties that are comparable to forests in temperate Europe, the potential for offsetting may become a growing factor in local forestry policy once Israel begins to regulate CO_2 emissions.",2010-12-01,10.1007/s11842-010-9125-z,"['Tal, Alon', 'Gordon, Jessica']",Small-scale Forestry,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11842-010-9125-z,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer

1982,"Landowner Willingness to Engage in Long-Term Timber Leases in West Virginia, USA","As global competition increases for wood-based products, the need for more efficient supply chains becomes increasingly important. In the forest products sector, these supply chains involve individuals and firms ranging from private forestland owners with standing timber to factories producing final finished products. Long-term timber leases are one mechanism that can be used to develop access to timber supplies for companies unable or unwilling to purchase land outright for growing timber. To investigate private forest owner opinions and attitudes regarding long-term timber leases, we conducted a survey of landowners from Wetzel county, West Virginia. No long-term leases were reported by respondents, but 24% claimed they would enter a lease under certain conditions. The most frequently listed concern related to long-term timber leases was for the “loss of control”. Results of this survey are discussed in the light of forest management efforts that might be used to improve the social, financial, and environmental benefits for private forest owners.",2008-06-01,10.1007/s11842-008-9044-4,"['McGill, David W.', 'Grushecky, Shawn T.', 'Moss, Stuart', 'Pierskalla, Chad', 'Schuler, Al']",Small-scale Forestry,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11842-008-9044-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1983,Creating Carbon Offsets in Agriculture through No-Till Cultivation: A Meta-Analysis of Costs and Carbon Benefits,"Carbon terrestrial sinks are often seen as a low-cost alternative to fuel switching and reduced fossil fuel use for lowering atmospheric CO_2. To determine whether this is true for agriculture, one meta-regression analysis (52 studies, 536 observations) examines the costs of switching from conventional tillage to no-till, while another (51 studies, 374 observations) compares carbon accumulation under the two practices. Costs per ton of carbon uptake are determined by combining the two results. The viability of agricultural carbon sinks is found to vary by region and crop, with no-till representing a low-cost option in some regions (costs of less than $10 per tC), but a high-cost option in others (costs of 100–$400 per tC). A particularly important finding is that no-till cultivation may store no carbon at all if measurements are taken at sufficient depth. In some circumstances no-till cultivation may yield a ‘triple dividend” of carbon storage, increased returns and reduced soil erosion, but in many others creating carbon offset credits in agricultural soils is not cost effective because reduced tillage practices store little or no carbon.",2005-01-01,10.1007/s10584-005-6010-4,"['Manley, James', 'van Kooten, G.

Trade-Based Carbon Sequestration Accounting
","This article describes and illustrates an accounting method to assess and compare “early” carbon sequestration investments and trades on the basis of the number of standardized CO_2 emission offset credits they will provide. The “gold standard” for such credits is assumed to be a relatively riskless credit based on a CO_2 emission reduction that provides offsets against CO_2 emissions on a one-for-one basis. The number of credits associated with carbon sequestration needs to account for time, risk, durability, permanence, additionality, and other factors that future trade regulators will most certainly use to assign “official” credits to sequestration projects. The method that is presented here uses established principles of natural resource accounting and conventional rules of asset valuation to “score” projects. A review of 20 “early” voluntary United States based CO_2 offset trades that involve carbon sequestration reveals that the assumptions that buyers, sellers, brokers, and traders are using to characterize the economic potential of their investments and trades vary enormously. The article develops a “universal carbon sequestration credit scoring equation” and uses two of these trades to illustrate the sensitivity of trade outcomes to various assumptions about how future trade auditors are likely to “score” carbon sequestration projects in terms of their “equivalency” with CO_2 emission reductions. The article emphasizes the importance of using a standard credit scoring method that accounts for time and risk to assess and compare even unofficial prototype carbon sequestration trades. The scoring method illustrated in this article is a tool that can protect the integrity of carbon sequestration credit trading and can assist buyers and sellers in evaluating the real economic potential of prospective trades.",2004-08-01,10.1007/s00267-003-9112-7,"['King, Dennis M.']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-003-9112-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1985,"Land-Use Change, Carbon Sequestration and Poverty Alleviation","In this article, we seek to identify where the greatest potential for synergies between carbon sequestration and poverty alleviation lie and ways they can be enhanced. We assess the amount and eligibility criteria of sequestration payment sources to developing countries. Many land-use changes accessible to low-income land users are potentially competitive in a market where payments are likely to range between between $11 to $15 per carbon ton sequestered. We present a conceptual framework of land-use decision-making to assess the potential for sequestration adoption among the poor. The determinants of adoption vary according to the impact of adoption on the returns to productive factors in the absence of any payment for sequestration. Where sequestration leads to a decrease in returns, the key determinant is the return to sequestration and labor, which are driven by the potential sequestration supply per unit land area and labor-use requirements. When sequestration adoption leads to an increase in returns, barriers to land-use change are present, which is frequently the case for the poor. Adoption is determined by the capacity of sequestration payments to overcome constraints. Barrier removal may involve designing payments to overcome risk or investment constraints, or wider institutional reform. Sequestration values may be insufficient to cover costs of institutional reform, requiring incorporation into wider development programs. A survey of results from empirical studies lend support to the analysis. We conclude with an assessment of transaction cost impacts on sequestration adoption among the poor, and how these can be addressed.",2004-07-01,10.1007/s00267-003-9146-x,"['Lipper, Leslie', 'Cavatassi, Romina']",Environmental Management,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-003-9146-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon offset credit"")",springer
1986,A Comparative Assessment of Climate Policies of Top Emitters: Towards Strengthening Climate Diplomacy and Action,"Top emitters of the world account for nearly three-quarters of global emissions, yet they are unwilling to do substantial to meaningfully mitigate climate change risks. In the current climate policy landscape, the prospects for a rational climate policy are exceedingly vague. Several negotiations, agreements and policies have failed consistently for the last several decades. This chapter evaluates the climate policies of top emitting countries by using four broad criteria, namely, environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, equity and political feasibility. The chapter first delineates the rationale and general evaluative framework of the analysis and then investigates top emitters’ climate policies according to the four perspectives indicated. On the basis of the analysis, top emitters are clustered according to their performances in the determinants of climate policy into three main actors—Laggards, Average and Pushers. The chapter shows that political feasibility is the weakest component in top emitters’ current climate policies, followed by equity concerns, whilst environmental effectiveness appears to be the most successful constituent and much progress is still required in the domain of economic efficiency. Finally, the chapter points out some common threads in, and emerging issues from, top emitters’ climate policies. The chapter concludes that the politics of climate change, energy policy and the environmental justice might be reoriented in ways that could result in more robust and sustainable political consensus for action.",2018-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-79123-4_4,"['Grasso, Marco', 'Dutta, Venkatesh']",Revisiting Globalization,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-79123-4_4,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions carbon credit"")",springer

Globalisation isn’t just a matter of economic, political, and cultural boundary crossings, but now has to be understood as a matter of material transformation. The environment is no longer ‘out there’ as the given context for humanity; globalisation has changed that both conceptually and in terms of how governance now needs to operate to shape the future conditions for human life in an interconnected and rapidly changing biosphere. Globalisation has, among other things, substantially rearranged the species mix in most of the fertile parts of the terrestrial biosphere, dramatically changed ocean ecosystems through industrial scale fishing and is now setting in motion disruptive climate changes too.

1989,Opportunities and challenges for mangrove carbon sequestration in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam,"Increasing value is attributed to mangroves due to their considerable capacity to sequester carbon, known as ‘blue carbon’. Assessments of opportunities and challenges associated with estimating the significance of carbon sequestered by mangroves need to consider a range of disciplinary perspectives, including the bio-physical science mangroves, social and economic issues of land use, local and international law, and the role of public and private finance. We undertook an interdisciplinary review based on available literature and fieldwork focused on parts of the Mekong River Delta (MRD). Preliminary estimates indicate mangrove biomass may be 70–150 t ha^−1, but considerably larger storage of carbon occurs in sediments beneath mangroves. These natural stores of carbon are compromised when mangroves are removed to accommodate anthropogenic activities. Mangroves are an important resource in the MRD that supplies multiple goods and services, and conservation or re-establishment of mangroves provides many benefits. International law and within-country environmental frameworks offer increasing scope to recognize the role that mangrove forests play through carbon sequestration, in order that these might lead to funding opportunities, both in public and private sectors. Such schemes need to have positive rather than negative impacts on the livelihoods of the many people living within and adjacent to these wetlands. Nevertheless, many challenges remain and it will require further targeted and coordinated scientific research, development of economic and social incentives to protect and restore mangroves, supportive law and policy mechanisms at global and national levels, and establishment of long-term financing for such endeavours.",2016-07-01,10.1007/s11625-016-0359-3,"['Warner, Robin', 'Kaidonis, Mary', 'Dun, Olivia', 'Rogers, Kerrylee', 'Shi, Yubing', 'Nguyen, Thang T.

1990,Reduction targets and abatement costs of developing countries resulting from global and developed countries’ reduction targets by 2050,"The European Union (EU) has advocated an emission reduction target for developed countries of 80% to 95% below the 1990 level by 2050, and a global reduction target of 50%. Developing countries have resisted the inclusion of these targets in both the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Copenhagen Accord and Cancún Agreements. This paper analyses what these targets would imply for emission targets, abatement costs and energy consumption of developing countries, taking into account the conditional emission reduction pledges for 2020. An 80% reduction target for developed countries would imply more stringent per capita emission targets for developing countries than developed countries by 2050. Moreover, abatement costs of developing countries would be higher than those of developed countries. An 85% to 90% reduction target for developed countries would result in similar per capita emission targets and abatement costs for developed and developing countries by 2050. Total reduction targets for developing countries would range from 30% to 40% below 2005 levels by 2050 and from 30% to 35% above 2005 levels by 2030. The 2030 target for China would be 40% to 45% above 2005 levels, compared to a target for the EU of 45% to 50% below 1990 and for the United States of America (USA) 30% to 35% below 1990. Emission target trajectories for Brazil, South Africa and China would peak before 2025 and for India by around 2025. From the analysis, we may conclude that from the viewpoint of developing countries either developed countries increase their target above 85%, and/or make substantial side-payments.",2013-04-01,10.1007/s11027-012-9371-9,"['Elzen, Michel G.

1991,Solar Distillation,"“Solar distillation” is a technology for producing potable water from brackish and underground water of low-quality at low cost. It can reduce water-scarcity problems together with other water purification technologies. Solar distillation is analogous to natural hydrological cycle. It uses an apparatus called a solar still in which water is evaporated using solar energy, a form of renewable energy, and collected as distillate after condensation of the vapor. It effectively produces distilled water after removal of impurities. The major advantage of this is the use of solar energy instead of electrical energy generated from conventional fuels. This helps in producing potable water without degrading our environment. Over time, researchers have studied several designs of solar stills to evaluate its performance for different climatic, operational, and design parameters. In this chapter, many aspects of this technology are being covered. Among those, the working principle explains the production of distilled water through evaporation and condensation process inside the solar still, including its advantages and drawbacks. The evolution of the solar still is discussed under the historical background section and classified as passive or active solar stills. Various heat gains and losses and a methodology to develop a thermal model to predict the solar still performance are presented. Thereafter, the effects of various parameters, economic, energy-exergy analysis including carbon credit, and technology transfer with challenges in adoption are given. In conclusion, the probable extensive use of this technology to solve water problems on a large scale all over the world is presented.",2011-01-01,10.1007/978-94-007-1104-4_6,"['Dev, Rahul', 'Tiwari, Gopal Nath']",Drinking Water Treatment,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-007-1104-4_6,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions carbon credit"")",springer
1992,Making carbon sequestration a paying proposition,"Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO_2) has increased from a preindustrial concentration of about 280 ppm to about 367 ppm at present. The increase has closely followed the increase in CO_2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels. Global warming caused by increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is the major environmental challenge for the 21st century. Reducing worldwide emissions of CO_2 requires multiple mitigation pathways, including reductions in energy consumption, more efficient use of available energy, the application of renewable energy sources, and sequestration. Sequestration is a major tool for managing carbon emissions. In a majority of cases CO_2 is viewed as waste to be disposed; however, with advanced technology, carbon sequestration can become a value-added proposition. There are a number of potential opportunities that render sequestration economically viable. In this study, we review these most economically promising opportunities and pathways of carbon sequestration, including reforestation, best agricultural production, housing and furniture, enhanced oil recovery, coalbed methane (CBM), and CO_2 hydrates. Many of these terrestrial and geological sequestration opportunities are expected to provide a direct economic benefit over that obtained by merely reducing the atmospheric CO_2 loading. Sequestration opportunities in 11 states of the Southeast and South Central United States are discussed. Among the most promising methods for the region include reforestation and CBM. The annual forest carbon sink in this region is estimated to be 76 Tg C/year, which would amount to an expenditure of $11.1–13.9 billion/year. Best management practices could enhance carbon sequestration by 53.9 Tg C/year, accounting for 9.3% of current total annual regional greenhouse gas emission in the next 20 years. Annual carbon storage in housing, furniture, and other wood products in 1998 was estimated to be 13.9 Tg C in the region. Other sequestration options, including the direct injection of CO_2 in deep saline aquifers, mineralization, and biomineralization, are not expected to lead to direct economic gain. More detailed studies are needed for assessing the ultimate changes to the environment and the associated indirect cost savings for carbon sequestration.",2007-03-01,10.1007/s00114-006-0170-6,"['Han, Fengxiang X.', 'Lindner, Jeff S.', 'Wang, Chuji']",Naturwissenschaften,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00114-006-0170-6,"(""agr*"") AND (""emissions carbon credit"")",springer

1994,Border adjustments under unilateral carbon pricing: the case of Australian carbon tax,"In the absence of a global agreement to reduce emissions, Australia adopted a carbon tax unilaterally to curb its own emissions. During the debate prior to passing the carbon tax legislation in 2011, there were concerns about the challenge that Australia’s emissions-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) industries may face in terms of decreasing international competitiveness due to the unilateral nature of the tax and hence the potential for carbon leakage. In order to address these concerns, this paper explores possible border adjustment measures (BAMs) to complement the domestic carbon regulation in Australia using the multi-sector computable general equilibrium approach. We consider four border adjustments: border adjustments on imports based on domestic emissions; border adjustments on exports via a rebate for exports; a domestic production rebate; and full border adjustment on both exports and imports. We compare the numerical simulation results of these scenarios with a no border adjustments scenario from the standpoint of welfare, international competitiveness and carbon leakage. The key finding is that BAMs have a very small impact on the overall economy and on EITE sectors. In other words, the different BAMs have minimal impact on the outcomes of carbon pricing policy. This finding is consistent with studies for EU, USA, Canada and other countries. Hence, we conclude that the border adjustments are ineffective instruments to safeguard EITE industries in Australia.",2017-11-10,10.1186/s40008-017-0091-x,"['Siriwardana, Mahinda', 'Meng, Sam', 'McNeill, Judith']",Journal of Economic Structures,https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40008-017-0091-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit market"")",springer

In a non-cooperative framework, North and South regulate two types of pollution, local pollution (e.g., air and water pollution) and global pollution (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions), each of which induces heterogeneous damages for consumers. I find that (1) North or South can have the comparative advantage in the dirty sector; (2) whatever the region with this comparative advantage, the worldwide level of global pollution can either increase or decrease with trade; (3) local and global emissions evolve symmetrically in each region with trade, even though pollution regulations may be asymmetric.",2016-10-01,10.1007/s10640-015-9902-4,"['Ollivier, Hélène']",Environmental and Resource Economics,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10640-015-9902-4,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit market"")",springer

To this end, we explicitly assess (1) the macroeconomic welfare impacts and (2) the trade-based competitiveness effects of linking the European Union (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme in the year 2020. A stylized partial market analysis suggests that, independently of regional cost characteristics, the integration of emissions trading schemes (ETS) yields economic welfare gains for all participating regions. A computable general equilibrium analysis confirms these findings at the macroeconomic level: The economic efficiency losses from emissions regulation are diminished for both EU Member States and non-EU regions by linking ETS. However, the quantitative analysis suggests opposite trade-based incentives for linking up: while EU Member States improve their terms of trade by integrating with emerging ETS, non-EU linking candidates face competitiveness losses by linking. We conclude that, for non-EU regions, the attractiveness of linking ETS is a matter of priorities for economic welfare or international competitiveness. If these priorities are hierarchized in favor of welfare, the globalization of the carbon market could become a promising policy option complementing the efforts to reach a global climate agreement in 2015.",2016-08-01,10.1007/s11027-014-9631-y,"['Alexeeva, Victoria', 'Anger, Niels']",Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11027-014-9631-y,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit market"")",springer
1997,Development and Application of Economic and Environmental Models of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agriculture: Some Difficult Choices for Policy Makers,"This chapter describes how economic models designed to examine agricultural policy can be adapted to explore environmental applications such as the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture to a 2050 time horizon. The tensions between environmental policy aimed at reducing GHG emissions, and policies promoting agricultural production to increase food security are explored. Ireland is a major net exporter of beef and milk products, with agriculture representing a high share of non-Emissions Trading Scheme (non-ETS) GHG emissions. Ireland is used to illustrate an issue which has wide-scale global implications. The feasibility of achieving emission reductions is examined in the absence of technical abatement measures. Instead, to reduce emissions the size of the suckler herd is limited. However, it is found that even eliminating the suckler herd would leave emissions well short of achieving a 20 % reduction target. Even a 10 % GHG emissions reduction, while possible under this approach, is likely to be politically unfeasible. The tension between environmental and food security is likely to be replicated at a global level, given the significant contribution of agricultural production to anthropogenic climate change. The chapter highlights the importance of detailed modelling of future emissions in advance of setting feasible emissions reduction targets.",2014-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-06635-6_13,"['Donnellan, Trevor', 'Hanrahan, Kevin', 'Breen, James P.']",Agricultural Cooperative Management and Policy,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-06635-6_13,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit market"")",springer
1998,The Dönje Hydropower Scenario,"This chapter presents the cost-benefit analysis of the Dönje hydropower re-regulation. The theoretical cost-benefit rule is briefly discussed. It is seemingly simple, but is based on a quite complex open economy setting. The major benefits of the re-regulation are environmental, such as more salmon in the river, and hence improved fishery, improved aesthetical values, improved canoing and other such leisure activities. A web-based questionnaire was used to assess the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for these benefits. The valuation question is novel in the sense that it introduces intervals (upper and lower bounds for WTP) that are selected by the respondent. The chapter then goes on to estimate the costs of the proposal. These are mainly the loss of profits by the hydropower company and externalities of coal-fired replacement power. A sensitivity analysis of the result of the cost-benefit analysis is undertaken.",2013-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-36790-8_2,"['Johansson, Per-Olov', 'Kriström, Bengt']",Evaluating Water Projects,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-36790-8_2,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit market"")",springer
1999,Towards Empirical Measurement of Externalities,"This chapter details the approaches used to estimate the value of non-market goods and services attributable to the scenarios. The natural science team of the research project carried out detailed experiments at the power plant, in order to assess how a changed flow would affect fish ecology. In fact, the perturbations or scenarios under study were implemented in a test run and the ecological consequences thus monitored live on site. A contingent valuation experiment was undertaken using a web-based survey instrument. The contingent valuation study targeted respondents in the municipality affected by the considered perturbations in water flows. It was preceded by a focus groups analysis and the on-site ecological assessment described above. These two studies were basic ingredients in the scenario development. A key issue in any survey is the elicitation architecture, i.e. the way of eliciting information from the respondent. We argue that self-selected intervals provides a rich picture of response uncertainty, potentially increase response-rates and maintains a link to recent ideas on coherent arbitrariness. We implemented this approach in the present study by allowing the respondents to choose between a point and a self-selected interval. Thus, if they could not answer the valuation question with a point estimate (as our theory does suggest), they were then asked to submit the answer as an interval. In other words, we assume that true WTP is either stated as a point or contained in the reported interval. The econometrics of this approach is discussed and different estimators are introduced and their properties are compared. Finally, the chapter addresses some other non-priced items, such as the cost of emissions caused by replacement power (assumed to be provided by coal-fired plants).",2012-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-27670-5_5,"['Johansson, Per-Olov', 'Kriström, Bengt']",The Economics of Evaluating Water Projects,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-27670-5_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit market"")",springer
2000,Cost Effective and Environmentally Safe Emission Trading Under Uncertainty,"The aim of this paper is to analyze robust cost-effective and environmentally safe carbon emission trading schemes under uncertainties of emissions and costs, and asymmetric information of participants. The proposed model allows to control explicitly the safety of Kyoto (or other) targets by taking long-term perspectives on emission trading. The dynamics of this scheme is driven by bilateral trades with different endogenous disequilibrium prices between mutually beneficial trades, but finally the system converges to cost-effective and environmentally safe global equilibrium. The safety constraints work as a discounting mechanism that discounts the reported emissions to detectable undershooting levels. This, in turn, provides incentives for participants to reduce uncertainties. The model shows that uncertainties and short term market perspectives may easily prevent price-based trading to be environmentally safe and cost-effective scheme. The desirable equilibrium emerges only under proper price-formation mechanisms. The role of the proposed computerized multi-agent trading system is central for dealing with long-term perspectives, irreversibility and lock-in equilibriums of trades. This system can be viewed as a device for decentralized collective regulation of trades based on unified approaches to modeling of uncertainty, calculation of costs and trading rules.",2010-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-03735-1_5,"['Ermolieva, T.', 'Ermoliev, Y.', 'Fischer, G.', 'Jonas, M.', 'Makowski, M.']",Coping with Uncertainty,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-03735-1_5,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit market"")",springer
2001,The benefits of the Kyoto Protocol to developing countries,"The Kyoto Protocol relies on incentive-based regulations layered underneath a global cap on net emissions of greenhouse gases. Within the Kyoto Protocol are opportunities and constraints for signatory nations. Of concern to developing nations are the constraints the Kyoto Protocol could place on future growth. We examine the constraints and the opportunities offered to developing countries within the Kyoto Protocol. By identifying the potential costs and benefits the Kyoto Protocol has to offer to developing countries and by examining the incentives each create, we hope to spark serious investigations into ways to minimize the potential costs of entering the Kyoto Protocol and take full advantage of the potential benefits.",2008-12-01,10.1007/s10668-007-9082-7,"['Swinton, John R.', 'Sarkar, Amin']","Environment, Development and Sustainability",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10668-007-9082-7,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit market"")",springer
2002,Tradable Permit Systems: Considering Uncertainty in Emission Estimates,"We simulate the market for emission permits by considering uncertainty in emission inventory reports. The approach taken in this analysis is to enhance the emissions reported in each region by a certain part of their uncertainty when compliance with the Kyoto targets is being proved. While this formulation is not new in the literature, we define the uncertainty component in a way that enables comparison with the approach of effective permits presented in Nahorski, Horabik, and Jonas ( 2007 ) Compliance and emissions trading under the Kyoto protocol: Rules for uncertain inventories, (this issue). We show and explain that the transformation to effective permits bears additional costs apart from those resulting from shifting the Kyoto targets.",2007-09-01,10.1007/s11267-006-9110-x,"['Bartoszczuk, Paweł', 'Horabik, Joanna']","Water, Air, & Soil Pollution: Focus",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11267-006-9110-x,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit market"")",springer
2003,Extension of EU Emissions Trading Scheme to Other Sectors and Gases: Consequences for Uncertainty of Total Tradable Amount,"Emissions trading in the European Union (EU), covering the least uncertain emission sources of greenhouse gas emission inventories (CO_2 from combustion and selected industrial processes in large installations), began in 2005. During the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008–2012), the emissions trading between Parties to the Protocol will cover all greenhouse gases (CO_2, CH_4, N_2O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF_6) and sectors (energy, industry, agriculture, waste, and selected land-use activities) included in the Protocol. In this paper, we estimate the uncertainties in different emissions trading schemes based on uncertainties in corresponding inventories. According to the results, uncertainty in emissions from the EU15 and the EU25 included in the first phase of the EU emissions trading scheme (2005–2007) is ±3% (at 95% confidence interval relative to the mean value). If the trading were extended to CH_4 and N_2O, in addition to CO_2, but no new emissions sectors were included, the tradable amount of emissions would increase by only 2% and the uncertainty in the emissions would range from −4 to +8%. Finally, uncertainty in emissions included in emissions trading under the Kyoto Protocol was estimated to vary from −6 to +21%. Inclusion of removals from forest-related activities under the Kyoto Protocol did not notably affect uncertainty, as the volume of these removals is estimated to be small.",2007-09-01,10.1007/s11267-006-9111-9,"['Monni, S.', 'Syri, S.', 'Pipatti, R.', 'Savolainen, I.']","Water, Air, & Soil Pollution: Focus",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s11267-006-9111-9,"(""agr*"") AND (""carbon permit market"")",springer
